In Sections 2.3 and 2.4, I survey the basic claims of these two approaches,
rather than comparing and contrasting the myriad proposals for inWxal
placement. Section 2.4 is a critical discussion of these approaches. In particu-
lar, I focus on several issues which are highly problematic for the Phonological
Readjustment approach and conclude that this line of analysis cannot be
maintained. In the following chapters, I show that the Phonological
Subcategorization approach, properly understood in the context of a holistic
view of the theory of grammar, contains the machinery necessary for
an explanation of the data which is problematic for the Phonological
Readjustment analysis.
2.3 InWxation as a phonological process
Phonological Readjustment analyses share the unifying, but often implicit,
assumption that inWxes are underlyingly adpositional morphologically; that
is, they are sisters to some morphological constituent. The surface appearance
of inWxation comes about as the result of readjustments (see Buckley 1997;
Halle 2001; Hyman and Inkelas 1997; Kaufman 2003; McCarthy 2003b;
McCarthy and Prince 1993a, 1994b; Moravcsik 1977; Stemberger and Bern-
hardt 1998). Derivational theories implement this idea diVerently from con-
straint-based approaches, however. From the perspective of a derivational
theory of the grammar, inWxation does not exist as a morphological process.
The semblance of inWxation is taken to be the result of segmental metathesis
(Halle 2001; Moravcsik 1977). For example, Halle (2001) argues that many of
the so-called VC inWxes in many Austronesian languages are in fact CV
preWxes. The apparent surface inWxing pattern is a matter of Onset Metath-
esis. Take, for example, the [+realis] construction in Tagalog, as illustrated by
the data below taken from Schachter and Otanes (1972: 370):
(14) /in, ?awi/ ! ?-in-awit ‘sang’
/in, bigy, an/ ! b-in-igy-an ‘gave to’
/?i, in, bilih/ ! ?i-b-in-ilih ‘bought for’
/?i, ka-takoh/ ! ?i-k-in-a-takoh ‘caused to run for’
What is inWxation? 17
Contrary to Schachter and Otanes’s morphological analysis, Halle (2001)
proposes that the [+realis] morpheme is underlyingly a CV preWx, ni-. The
preWx appears to be inWxed due to a rule of onset metathesis.

/?i, ni, bilih/ ! ?i-bi-nilih ‘bought for’
/?i, ni, ka-takboh/ ! ?i-ki-na-takboh ‘caused to run for’
Schematically, Halle’s Onset Metathesis analysis of inWxation can be stated as
follows:

This understanding of ‘inWxation’ follows from generative theories of gram-
mar that are strictly modular. Operations in one module, like Syntax, are
prevented from accessing or referring to information derived in another
module, such as the phonological component. This view was reXected in
Moravcsik’s 1977 seminal treatise on the rules of inWxing which implements
the separation of information by proposing a metaconstraint against hetero-
modality in grammatical statements. However, nowhere is this modular view
of the grammar and its implication for the analysis of inWxation more
succinctly articulated than in Halle’s 2001 rebuttal against the Optimality
Theoretic analysis of inWxation:
[F]rom the point of view of syntax, morphemes are indivisible, atom pieces. The
syntax is systematically oblivious of phonological aspects of the morphemes. In the
theory of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993) this obliviousness is
formally reXected by the absence—in syntactic representations—of the phonetic
exponents of the morphemes. In the syntax proper, morphemes are nothing but
complexes of syntactic and semantic features; their phonetic exponents are inserted
by Vocabulary Insertion, which is part of the morphology. Since the phonetic expo-
nents of morphemes are thus not present in the syntax, it is literally impossible within
the syntax to inWx /um/ or /in/ before the Wrst vowel of the Tagalog stem. This can only
be done in the morphology or phonology, after the phonetic exponents of the
morpheme have been spelled out. (Halle 2001: 153)
18 What is inWxation?
While this analysis duly handles the data discussed by Halle, the status of
Onset Metathesis within Tagalog and in the theory of inWx placement in
general remains obscured. Onset Metathesis cannot be a general phono-
logical process in the language since there are many instances of preWxation
that do not involve inWxation (e.g., the irrealis ma- and realis na- are
straightforwardly preWxing; ma-takot ‘fear.irrealis.perfective’ and na-takot
‘fear.realis.perfective’). Thus, Onset Metathesis must be treated as a mor-
pheme-speciWc rule that is triggered only when the [+realis] morpheme is
applied. On this view, ‘inWxation’ is accounted for by stipulations. No
general principle in the grammar triggers the application of segmental
metathesis rules per se. The readjustment rule is speciWc to the morpheme
in question.
On the other hand, for constraint-based models of phonology which
eschew structure-building and structure-changing rules in favor of static
well-formedness conditions evaluating output forms, interface between
domains, if modularity still plays any substantial role at all in such a
model, is often celebrated rather than avoided. The rationale behind this
type of Phonological Readjustment analysis is not imposed by the intrinsic
architecture of the grammar per se, but is rather a matter of methodological
priorities. As McCarthy and Prince noted, the goal of all linguistic theories
‘is to achieve greater empirical coverage with fewer resources—maybe with
no resources at all that are speciWc to the domain under investigation’
(McCarthy and Prince 1994: B13). In particular, the goal of Prosodic Morph-
ology, the rubric under which inWxation falls, is ‘[t]o explain properties of
morphology/phonology dependency in terms of independent, general prop-
erties’ (McCarthy and Prince 1994b: B1). On this view, motivations for the
Phonological Readjustment approach stem from (i) a concern of formal
economy, that is, the elimination of inWxes as formal objects by deriving
inWxes from other morphological primitives, such as preWxes and suYxes,
and (ii) the drive to achieve explanatory adequacy in a theory of grammar.
Within the context of a constraint-based framework like Optimality Theory,
this was taken to mean that inWxation should be derived, rather than
stipulated, through constraint interaction. Consider, for example, the case
of agreement inWxation in the Siouan language, Dakota. The Dakotan
agreement system consists of a set of person/number aYxes which are
preWxed to monosyllabic verb roots and some polysyllabic ones, but are
inWxed after the initial syllable into other polysyllabic verb roots of a
lexically speciWed subclass.

McCarthy and Prince (1993a) analyze the agreement markers as formally
preWxes which are subject to the ALIGN-IN-STEM constraint in (18). This
constraint states that the left edge of the agreement marker must coincide
with the left edge of the stem.
(18) ALIGN-IN-STEM(Dakota)
Align([AGR]Af, L, Stem, L)
For the inWx-taking subclass of verb roots, however, the agreement mor-
phemes are prevented from surfacing as preWxes by the dominant ALIGN-
ROOT constraint in (19).
(19) ALIGN-ROOT(Dakota)
Align(Root, L, PrWd, L)
As shown in Tableau (20), the agreement marker -wa- is inWxed after the Wrst
CV of the root (20c) because of the dominance of Align-Root over Align-
in-Stem (see the failure of (20a)). Minimal displacement of the agreement
markers from the absolute initial position, i.e., ćwa.a.pa, does not suYce to
derive the optimal output. McCarthy and Prince argue that the constraint
Onset is involved, disfavoring candidates with syllables that are onsetless.

20 What is inWxation?
Thus, unlike the derivational theories of Phonological Readjustment, which
derive the surface appearance of inWxation by way of some phonological
operation, on the view of the constraint-based approach, aYx movement is
key. As illustrated above, ‘inWxation shows that phonological constraints can
determine even the linear order of morphemes and morpheme parts’ (McCarthy
and Prince 1993a: 85). In a constraint-based approach, aYx reordering is motiv-
ated by reifying a long-standing intuition that the position of an inWx is
functionally linked to its shape. That is, aYxes ‘migrate’ only when the inWxed
outcome yields ‘better’ surface realization (Anderson 1972; Buckley 1997; Cohn
1992; McCarthy and Prince 1993a; Prince and Smolensky 1993). What counts
as the functional motivating factors for inWxation are many, although not all
of them have equal explanatory values. Some argue that aYxes move away
from the edge in order to improve syllable structure well-formedness (McCarthy
2003b; McCarthy and Prince 1993a, 1994b; Prince and Smolensky 1993). Others
consider it a matter of featural preservation (Buckley 1997). Like the case of
Dakota, many have also argued that inWxation serves to preserve morphotactics
(Lubowicz 2005; Stemberger and Bernhardt 1998).
In this section, I reviewed the logic of the Phonological Readjustment
approach to inWxation in both derivational and non-derivational frameworks.
The fundamental assumption that uniWes all Phonological Readjustment-
based analyses is the insistence that the motivation for inWxation must be
exogenous. The Phonological Subcategorization approach, to be reviewed in
the next section, eschews this analytic bias.
2.4 InWxation as morpho-phonological mismatch
Proponents of the Phonological Subcategorization approach embrace the
mismatch between morphological and phonological representations. On
this view, an inWx is an aYx that is sensitive to the phonological properties
of its sister. Phonological sensitivity is often encoded in the form of
phonological subcategorization, that is, an inWx is an aYx that subcategorizes
speciWcally for a phonological constituent as its sister, rather than a morpho-
logical one. Simplifying the analysis at this juncture, the expletive inWx in
English, for example, can be treated as lodging before a stressed trochaic foot
(FT’). Such a subcategorization requirement may be stated in terms of a
subcategorization frame or a GA constraint (21). Crucially, when the left
edge of the stressed foot and the left edge of a stem coincide, the expletive
appears preWxing (e.g., bloody-(háppy)). When the left edge of the stem is to
What is inWxation? 21
the left of the stressed foot, the expletive appears inWxing (e.g., fan-
bloody-(tástic), Kalama-goddamn-(zóo)).5
(21) English expletive
Subcategorization frame: ‘expletive’ [(ss . . . )]
Generalized Alignment: Align (‘expletive’, R, FT’, L)
Likewise, some theories analyze inWxes as bi-dependent in that inWxes subcat-
egorize for two entities simultaneously (Inkelas 1990; Kiparsky 1986). That is,
inWxes subcategorize for some prosodic constituent (i.e., the frame-internal [ ]p
in (22)) and the material across which they are attached (i.e., the X in (22)).
(22) [X__[ ]p ]p
Thus, for example, the inWx -in- in the Timugon dialect of Sabah Murut (see
(3)) has the subcategorization frame [(C) __ [ ]p ]p where -in- is understood
to take a prosodic stem, in the sense of Inkelas 1990, as its right constituent
and may optionally be preceded by a consonant.
To be sure, the ability for an aYx to subcategorize for a phonological
constituent is not unique to inWxes. Adpositional aYxes often have phono-
logical subcategorization requirements as well. A typology of subcategoriza-
tion types and examples of each type are given in (23).
(23) Subcategorization Examples
Morphological (Adpositional aYx) English nominalizing -ness
Morphological/Phonological German perfective participle ge-
Phonological (InWx) English ma-inWxation, Ulwa
ka-inWxation
From the perspective of learning, phonological subcategorization takes place
under two scenarios. When the placement of a morpheme can be determined
by both morphological and prosodic/phonological means simultaneously, this
analytical ambiguity often gives rise to selection of either one or both modes of
aYxation. Examples of simultaneous subcategorizations at the morphological
and phonological levels are not diYcult to Wnd in the literature. For example,
the German perfective participle, ge-, only attaches to stems that begin with a
stressed syllable; the Lappish illative plural has two allomorphs: -ide, which
appears after a stem with an even number of syllables, and -ida, which appears
after a stem with an odd number of syllables (Bergsland 1976; Hargus 1993).
Similarly, in Dyirbal, the ergative suYx is -Œgu with disyllabic V-Wnal nouns
5 In this work, I shall focus strictly on the purely phonologically governed distribution of the
expletive and leave aside the issue of the interaction between expletive placement and morphological
boundary for future research (but see McCawley 1978).
22 What is inWxation?
(24a), but is -gu when the stem is longer (24b). Stress is initial and alternating
in Dyirbal although Wnal syllables are never stressed (Dixon 1972: 274–6).
(24) a. yaa-˛gu ‘man’
b. yamani-gu ‘rainbow’
balagara-gu ‘they’
According to McCarthy and Prince (1993b), the -Œgu suYx subcategorizes for
the head foot as its left-sister (i.e., Affix-to-Foot). When direct suYxation
to a disyllabic stem is not possible (i.e., when the right edge of the head
foot does not coincide with the right edge of the stem), the general, non-
phonological subcategorizing, suYxal allomorph, -gu, is used instead (see
also Paster 2006). The subcategorization requirement of an inWx is formally
no diVerent from that of these ergative suYxes. The only diVerence is in the
response to the failure of Phonological Subcategorization satisfaction. In
Dyirbal, for example, when the Phonological Subcategorization of the ergative
-Œgu cannot be satisWed adpositionally, instead of inWxation (e.g., *yama-Œgu-
ni), an alternative general suYxal allomorph, -gu, is used instead. Other
languages may return no output (in which case, ineVability obtains) or
make use of periphrasis. I will return to this topic in Section 6.4 in Chapter
6. The main point here is that, from this perspective, inWxes are really just
aYxes without any subcategorization requirement stated at the morpho-
logical level. ‘InWxation’ is essentially epiphenomenonal; nothing in the gram-
mar requires morpheme interruption per se. There is no reordering of
segments or movement of aYxes. InWxation simply falls out from the cross-
level edge-alignment property of phonological subcategorization; no stipu-
lated mechanism is needed to account for inWxation.
Before turning to the comparison between Phonological Readjustment and
Phonological Subcategorization, it should be noted that phonological sensi-
tivity in morphology, particularly in the context of inWxation, may also be
encoded indirectly, for example, in the form of stem alternation. For example,
within the theory of Prosodic Morphology prior to the advent of Optimality
Theory (McCarthy and Prince 1990, 1993a, 1993b), inWxation is analyzed in
terms of operational prosodic circumscription, which is a factoring function
that allows a peripheral constituent to be parsed from a string. Operations can
then be performed on that element (positive circumscription) or on the
remainder (negative circumscription). In particular, prominence-driven
inWxes are analyzed in terms of positive operational prosodic circumscription
while edge-oriented inWxes are analyzed in terms of negative operational
prosodic circumscription. Consider, for example, that in Samoan, a Polynes-
ian language, plural is marked by reduplicating the penultimate, thus stressed,
What is inWxation? 23
syllable. Syllables are always open, thus the reduplicant is CV in shape. When
the stem is more than two syllables long, the reduplicant appears to inWx
before the stressed syllable.

atamái ‘clever’ atamamái
ma?alı́li ‘cold, feel cold’ ma?alilı́li
to?úlu ‘fall, drop’ to?u?úlu
Under positive prosodic circumscription, one Wrst selects the prosodic con-
stituent to be copied (represented by the function F), in this case, a stressed
foot (step i). The F-delimited portion of the word is assembled with the non-
F-delimited part of the stem (step ii). The reduplicative preWx O is then aYxed
to this circumscribed foot (step iii), followed by the reassembling in step iv.

In negative prosodic circumscription, the circumscribed prosodic constitu-
ent, rather than serving as the base of aYxation, is stripped away temporarily
for the purpose of aYxation.

24 What is inWxation?
For example, partial reduplication in Timugon Murut, an Austronesian
language spoken in Malaysia, can be analyzed in terms of negative circum-
scription where an initial onsetless syllable, if any, is circumscribed and
stripped away temporarily (McCarthy 2000). The reduplicative morpheme
is then attached to the residue (see (27b) for a step-wise illustration of this
operation). Operational prosodic circumscription was abandoned in the wake
of the advent of Optimality Theory. McCarthy (2000), for example, contends
that inWxation can be more insightfully analyzed in terms of the OT imple-
mentation of Phonological Readjustment. As reviewed in the next section,
however, such a conclusion is not warranted.
2.5 Phonological Readjustment and Phonological
Subcategorization compared
The diVerences between Phonological Readjustment and Phonological Sub-
categorization approaches to inWxation can be summarized schematically as
in (28). On the view of Phonological Subcategorization, an aYx, A, takes a
phonological constituent, X, as its left sister. When the right edge of X is
within the domain of the morphological host (and if A is to be realized
faithfully), the inWxal distribution of A obtains. InWxation is epiphenomenal
in the sense that no mechanism in the grammar requires the intramorphemic
distribution of the aYx in question. The inWx does not undergo any move-
ment at any level of the analysis either. If the stem boundary coincides with
the edge of X, the aYx will appear adpositionally. It is only when the
morphological and the phonological edges misalign that the aYx manifests
as an inWx.
From the perspective of Phonological Readjustment, on the other hand,
inWxation is the result of displacement. The aYx A is preWxed to the stem
XYZ. The phonology then repositions the terminal phonetic form of A (or
the morpheme A itself) inside the terminal phonetic form of XYZ and
inWxation obtains. It should be noted that the nature of the displacement
diVers between the derivational and constraint-based approaches to Phono-
logical Readjustment. From the perspective of the constraint-based model, it
is the morpheme that moves. As McCarthy and Prince (1993a: 85) emphasize,
‘inWxation shows that phonological constraints can determine even the linear
order of morphemes and morpheme parts’. On the view of the derivational
model, however, it is the phonological strings that permute, never the mor-
pheme itself.

This work is a defense of the Phonological Subcategorization view of inWxa-
tion. Before introducing in more detail the theoretic apparatus for the
understanding of Phonological Subcategorization, I review in some detail
arguments against the Phonological Readjustment approach. Since much
research has demonstrated the need for simultaneous reference to phono-
logical and morphological structures in languages (Booij 1985; Booij and
Rubach 1984, 1987; Cohn 1989; Inkelas 1990, 1993; Sproat 1985, 1986), I see
no reason to restrict our theoretical apparatus from accessing cross-modular
information. This freedom with respect to cross-module interaction is par-
ticularly acute in the context of constraint-based approaches to language (see
more discussion of this issue in the next chapter). As such, I shall limit my
discussion of the derivational view of Phonological Readjustment and focus
my attention instead on the constraint-based view of Phonological Readjust-
ment, particularly as it is implemented in Optimality Theory (henceforth OT-
PR). However, when appropriate, I will highlight critiques that are equally
applicable to both views of Phonological Readjustment.
2.5.1 On the ethological view of inWxation
OneofthemainargumentsforOT-PRrestsonthepremisethattheinWxabilityof
an aYx is partly determined by the phonological composition of the aYx itself
and the context in which it appears. Similar ethological observations have been
made repeatedly in the literature (Anderson 1972; Buckley 1997; Cohn 1992).
Formally, this intuition is captured by the constraint-ranking schema, P >> M,
one of the three basic tenets of Prosodic Morphology within Optimality Theory.
(29) Prosodic Morphology within OT (McCarthy and Prince 1993b: 110)
a. Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis
Templates are constraints on the prosody/morphology interface,
asserting the coincidence of morphological and prosodic constituent.
b. Template Satisfaction Condition
Templatic constraints may be undominated, in which case they are
satisWed fully, or they may be dominated, in which case they are
violated minimally, in accordance with general principles of
Optimality Theory.
26 What is inWxation?
c. Ranking Schema
P >> M
The main innovation of this conception of Prosodic Morphology lies in (29c),
which embodies the idea that prosody-governed morphology is the result of
phonological constraints (P) taking precedence over morphological ones
(M). Phonological constraints may be of several varieties (e.g., segmental
faithfulness, syllable well-formedness, segmental markedness, etc.). On the
other hand, morphological constraints generally include constraints on faith-
fulness (e.g., Faith-Root, Faith-AYx, etc.) and linear precedence (i.e., align-
ment constraints). It is the latter that is most relevant in the case of inWxation.
For example, McCarthy (2003b) proposes that the aYx -um- in Tagalog
should be treated formally as a preWx and is inWxed to avoid onsetless
word-initial syllables in the outputs. The aYx -um- is inWxed after the
stem-initial consonant since preWxing -um- would have resulted in a fatal
violation of Onset, which penalizes any onsetless syllables (30b). It serves
little purpose to ameliorate the fatal Onset violation by supplying the preWx
with an onset (30c) due to the dominance of Dep-C, a constraint that
penalizes consonant epenthesis. To be sure, gratuitous additional inward
migration of -um- is not encouraged since it does not improve the standing
of the candidate (see (30d)).
(30) Edgemost(L, um) The morpheme um is located at the left edge;
is a preWx.
Onset Syllables must begin with a consonant.

If inWxation were indeed the result of phonological constraints taking prece-
dence over morphological ones, and phonological constraints are constraints
penalizing marked structures, it follows that one should never expect to Wnd
instances of inWxation that yield structures that are more marked than
their preWxing or suYxing counterparts. This observation has prompted,
What is inWxation? 27
for example, Buckley to revel at the dearth of examples of ‘CV inWxes which
occur after the onset’ (1997: 14).
Blevins (1999) reports just such a case in Leti, an Austronesian language
spoken on the island of Leti, east of Timor.7 Leti nominalizing aYxation
has eight distinct phonological forms: three inWxes -ni-, -n-, -i-; three preWxes
ni-, i-, nia; a paraWx i-+-i-; and a zero allomorph. Each of these allomorphs
has very speciWc distribution. The inWx -ni- appears before the Wrst vowel of
the stem when the stem has an initial non-nasal or non-alveolar consonant
followed by a non-high vowel (31a). The inWx -ni- is realized as -n- when the
stem contains a high vowel after the initial consonant (31b).

Another allomorph of -ni- is -i-, which surfaces before the Wrst vowel of the
stem when the initial consonant is a sonorant or an alveolar consonant.

28 What is inWxation?
The fact that the nominalizing morph, -ni-, is inWxed is puzzling within a
prosodic optimization view of inWxation. It is unclear what problems con-
front the strategy of simply preWxing -ni- to the stem (e.g., *ni-teti instead of
t-ni-eti ‘chop, chopping’). The inWxal outputs invariably contain initial onset
clusters and vowel-vowel sequences;8 both are marked structures typologi-
cally. To be sure, Leti inWxation cannot be analyzed on the par as Dakota
agreement inWxation, that is, as an instance of edge avoidance. When the stem
is vowel-initial, the nominalizer is preWxed. According to van Engelenhoven
(2004), the i-preWx sometimes nominalizes the verb as an instrument while
the ni- preWx nominalizes the verbal act.
(33) Nominalizing -(n)i- in Leti
n-osri ‘to hunt’ i-osri, ni-osri ‘act of hunting’
n-otlu ‘to push’ i-otlu, ni-otlu ‘act of pushing’
n-atu ‘to know’ i-atu, ni-atu ‘knowledge’
n-odi ‘to carry’ i-odi, ni-odi ‘pole, load, act of carrying’
n-èmnu ‘to drink’ i-èmnu, ni-èmnu ‘act of drinking, drink, beverage’
n-òra ‘to be with’ i-òra, ni-òra ‘companion’
A similarly puzzling case of inWxation is found in Pingding Mandarin. As in
most Mandarin dialects, Pingding has a diminutive/hypocoristic aYxation
process. However, unlike the other dialects, where this process is marked by
the suYxing of a retroXexed morpheme (i.e., -r), the cognate morpheme in
Pingding, --, is inWxed before the rhyme of a syllable.
(34) Pingding --inWxation (Lin 2002; Xu 1981; Yu 2004b)
m@n tu˛ +  ! m@n tu˛ ‘hole on the door’
l`O t}u +  ! l`O t}u ‘old man’
ˆi`O p˛ +  ! ˆi`O p˛ ‘small notebook’
xu m˛ +  ! xu m˛ ‘back door’
ˆi`O ku +  ! ˆi`O ku ‘small wok’
xuA˛ xuA +  ! xuA˛ xuA ‘yellow Xower’
˛ +  ! ˛ ‘moth’
Outside the domain of inWxation, Pingding Mandarin has the canonical
Chinese syllable structure, (C)(G)V(C) where G stands for a glide. The very
fact that onset clusters should be tolerated just in the case of inWxation should
be evidence enough for rejecting the hypothesis that inWxation is a matter of
prosodic optimization. Lin (2002) notes that there is at least one redeeming
aspect of -inWxation, that is, it follows the Sonority Sequencing Constraint.
8 The high vowel in a vowel-vowel sequence is realized as a glide.
What is inWxation? 29
However, recent work on the positional markedness eVects of retroXexion
(Steriade 1995) has demonstrated that retroXexion is perceptually most salient
in post-vocalic positions. Thus, the ‘migration’ of [] to post-consonantal
position only endangers the identiWcation of the retroXex feature, rather than
enhancing it.
What the Leti and Pingding cases illustrate is that inWxation can occur for
no obvious prosodic or phonotactic gains. The optimization approach oVers
us no insight as to why such inWxation patterns exist at all. One may appeal to
edge avoidance to account for certain cases, but the fundamental appeal of the
OT-Phonological Readjustment approach is lost in such an analysis. That is,
the functional motivation for an aYx to migrate inward is to minimize
output prosodic or phonotactic markedness. This functional connection is
not readily available for the edge-avoidance analysis.
The list of non-functionally motivated inWxes may be expanded to include
inWxes that do not either improve or worsen output markedness. For
example, in Hua, a Papuan language of the Eastern Highlands of New Guinea,
the negative marker -?a- appears before the Wnal syllable.
(35) Hua negative formation (Haiman 1980)
zgavo zga?avo ‘not embrace’
harupo haru?apo ‘not slip’
Prosodically speaking, the suYxal counterpart of this CV marker would have
resulted in equally well-formed outputs (see also the Budukh case in (40)). No
obvious functional motivations can be adduced for the inWxing of such a
morpheme.
In light of the cases reviewed above, the purported functional bond
between the shape of an inWx and its position with respect to the host is at
best suspect. A closer look at the typology of inWx shape and its placement
property supports this position. Claims with regard to the functional con-
nection between morpheme shape and inWx position were established previ-
ously based on the perceived prevalence of VC aYxes that inWx after an onset
consonant. Upon closer examination, however, the purported functional
connection may actually reXect a bias introduced by impoverished sampling.
Of the forty cases of Wxed-segment VC inWxation, twenty-three are from the
Austronesian languages, eleven are from Austro-Asiatic languages, while only
six are from other languages.9 More importantly, of the thirty-four VC inWxes
that appear after the Wrst consonant or before the Wrst vowel of the stem, all

(1972) study of nasalization and inWxation in Sundanese, an Austronesian language.
30 What is inWxation?
but one belongs to the Austronesian and the Austro-Asiatic families.10 The
fact that the majority of the post-onset VC inWxes belong to one of two
language families suggests that such cases might be features inherited from
their respective protolanguages.11 In contrast, about 20 percent of the Wxed-
segment inWxes surveyed are CV in shape, about 10 percent are just a single
vowel, and about 44 percent are monoconsonantal. Of these coda- or cluster-
generating monoconsonantal inWxes, only Wve are from Austronesian and
three from Austro-Asiatic.

Thus, a closer look at the cross-linguistic evidence shows that an ethological
understanding of inWxation cannot be substantiated. Since the OT-PR ap-
proach to inWxation was built upon this ethological assumption of inWx
placement, the rejection of this premise left the foundation of the theory
badly shaken. In the next section, I turn to the empirical adequacy of the OT-
PR approach. Upon closer scrutiny, the theory crumbles as I reveal deep-
rooted problems with both the derivational and constraint-based versions of
Phonological Readjustment.
2.5.2 On the issue of empirical coverage: Problems of undergeneration
Both derivational and constraint-based Phonological Readjustment approaches
to inWx placement suVer from an inherent limitation on empirical coverage.
The most eVective demonstration of this limitation comes from the domain of
iterative inWxation. Iterative inWxation is commonly found among language
games and disguises (see Section 6.2 for more discussion). For example, a
language game in Hausa involves inserting -bV- after the vowel of each word-
internal syllable. The vowel of the inWx is a copy of the preceding vowel.
10 The lone exception comes from the intensive -eg- inWx in Yurok, an Algic language. The origin of
this inWx is discussed in Section 5.2.3.4 in Chapter 5.
11 The Austronesian VC inWxes are mainly reXexes of the actor focus *mu-/-um- or the perfective
*ni-/in- in Proto-Austronesian (Dahl 1976: ch. 22).
What is inWxation? 31

gidā gibı̀da ‘house’
maskı̄ mabàski ‘oily’
Màimunà Maibàimubùna ‘Maimuna (name)’
hatsı̄ habàtsi ‘grain’
Similarly, in Tagalog, the inWx -gVVdV- is inserted after the vowel of each
syllable. The unspeciWed vowels of the inWx copy the adjacent vocalism of the
basic form (Conklin 1956, 1959).
(38) Tagalog baliktad speech-disguise game (Conklin 1956)
hindı́? higı́idindigı́idi? ‘not, not’
ta˛háali? tagáada˛hagáadaligı́idi? ‘noon’
It is unclear what type of phonological readjustment can account for the
multitude of inWxal locations if inWxes are underlyingly adpositional. (Itera-
tive inWxation Wnds natural expression within a Phonological Subcategoriza-
tion approach, however. See Section 6.3 in Chapter 6 for more discussion.)
The limitation of Phonological Readjustment extends beyond the domain
of language games and disguises. For example, recall that Halle (2001) reana-
lyzes VC inWxation as a matter of CV preWxation followed by Onset Metathesis.
Thus, the fact that the passive completive marker in Toba Batak has two allo-
morphs (the allomorph ni- is preWxed to vowel-initial roots, while the
allomorph -in- is inWxed after the Wrst consonant of consonant-initial roots
(39a)) can be straightforwardly analyzed under the Onset Metathesis analysis.
Yet, not all VC inWxes can be reanalyzed in this way. Halle himself points out
that the nominalizing marker -al- in Toba Batak is a bona Wde inWx (Halle 2001:
163). That is, while -al- is inWxed before the Wrst vowel when the stem begins
with a consonant, it is straightforwardly preWxed to vowel-initial stems (39b).
Onset metathesis is not applicable here since vowel-initial stems are genuinely
vowel-initial (rather than beginning with a glottal stop as in Tagalog). Instead,
inWxation of the nominalizing -al- is treated as the result of al-preWxation
followed by Stem Onset Preposing (e.g., al-bátuk ! b-al-átuk ‘ladder’).
(39) a. ni-ulÓs-an ‘have been covered’ (completive passive)
b-in-úat ‘has been taken’ (completive passive)
j-in-oú-an ‘have been called repeatedly’ (completive passive)
b. b-al-átuk ‘ladder’
al-ógo ‘wind’
Onset Metathesis also oVers no recourse when the inWx is CV in shape. As
illustrated in (40), the prohibitive inWx -mE- in Budukh, a Lezgic language
spoken in the Caucasus, always appears after the initial vowel of the stem.
32 What is inWxation?
Onset Metathesis predicts the wrong results (e.g., m@+yīx@r ! *y@mīx@r, not
yīm@x@r).

Derivationalaccountsareparticularlyuninsightfulwhendealingwithtmesis,that
is, instances of inWxation involving a whole word into another (e.g., English
expletive inWxation: abso-bloody-lutely). Rule-based formulations of tmesis are
riddled with shortcomings. AronoV (1976: 70), for example, proposes the rule in
(41) for expletive inWxation in English. This rule dictates that the expletive inWx
mustbeprecededbyatertiarystressandfollowimmediatelybytheprimarystress.

braska), as McCarthy (1982) noted, it crucially fails to explain the relationship
amongstress,syllabiWcation,andtheinWxedexpletivethatis encodedintotherule.
Like its derivational cousin, OT-PR is limited in empirical coverage as well.
There exists one class of inWxes that has always been outside the purview of
OT-PR, that is, the stress-driven inWxes. From the outset, stress-driven inWxes
are treated in terms of prosodic subcategorization, a subtype of phonological
subcategorization (see e.g., McCarthy and Prince 1993a). For example, in
Ulwa, a Misumalpan language spoken in Nicaragua and Honduras, the
construct-state (CNS) markers are aYxed to the right edge of an iambic foot.
(42) Ulwa construct state (Green 1999: 64)

To account for these inWxal markers, McCarthy and Prince (1993a) set up the
prosodic subcategorization constraint in (43), formulated in the schema of
Generalized Alignment.
What is inWxation? 33
(43) Ulwa inWxal construct noun marker
ALIGN-TO-FOOT
ALIGN ([POSS]Af, L, FT’, R)
‘The left edge of the construct noun marker is aligned to the right edge
of the head foot.’
The Ulwa example thus highlights an important point about OT-PR. Unlike
its derivational cousin, the constraint-based approach does not reject
Phonological Subcategorization. It remains an integral part of its analytic
arsenal. However, there is an implicit priority in analytical preference. OT-PR
bears the main burden of explaining the Edge-Bias EVect. Phonological
Subcategorization is invoked only when no OT-PR option is available.
This analytic priority of Phonological Readjustment over Phonological Sub-
categorization is a reXection of two presuppositions. The Wrst is the
ethological attitude OT-PR analysts take toward inWx placement. As demon-
strated in the last section, however, the ethological view lacks empirical
substance and should not be maintained. The second stems from a theory-
internal bias against invoking sub-prosodic constituents in phonological
analysis.
The theory of Prosodic Morphology, Wrst articulated in McCarthy and
Prince (1986), requires morphological processes that interact with phonology
to refer to genuine prosodic constituents. The basic tenets of this theory are
given in (44).
(44) Basic tenets of Prosodic Morphology (McCarthy and Prince 1993b: 109)
Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis: Templates are deWned in terms
of the authentic units of prosody: mora (m), syllable (s), foot (Ft),
prosodic word (PrWd).
Template Satisfaction Condition: Satisfaction of templatic constraints is
obligatory and determined by the principles of prosody, both universal
and language-speciWc.
Prosodic Circumscription of Domains: The domain to which morpho-
logical operations apply may be circumscribed by prosodic criteria as
well as by the more familiar morphological ones.
The admittance of sub-prosodic unit into alignment or subcategorization
relation has traditionally been seen as an embarrassment to the theory of
Prosodic Morphology since the unit referred to by such an aYx often does not
match the units generally licensed by the Prosodic Hierarchy (see e.g.,
McCarthy and Prince 1993a). For example, on the view of Phonological
Subcategorization, the animate actor focus marker, -m-, in Atayal is treated
34 What is inWxation?
as subcategorizing for the Wrst consonant of the stem as its left-sister.12 Yet,
most theories of prosodic phonology do not admit a consonant as a possible
constituent within the Prosodic Hierarchy (see Broselow 1995 for an overview
of the evidence for and against skeletal units below the level of the mora).
(45) Atayal animate actor focus (Egerod 1965: 263–6)

kat kmat ‘bite’
kuu kmuu ‘too tired, not in the mood’
h˛u? hm˛u? ‘soak’
skziap kmziap ‘catch’
sbil smbil ‘leave behind’
While the need to refer to sub-prosodic units remains controversial in the
phonological literature, suggestive supportive evidence abounds. For ex-
ample, in speech-error studies, many have found that consonants and vowels
within words are often exchangeable.
(46) a. Consonantal exchange (Fromkin 1980)

st[I]rred the sh[i]p (steered the ship)
al[i]minum an’ st[u]l (aluminum an’ steel)
ch[i]ps ‘n tw[]ts (chirps ’n tweets)
Such an independent awareness of consonants from vowels is also observed in
poetic devices such as alliteration and assonance.
(47) Alliteration: In clichés: sweet smell of success, a dime a dozen, bigger
and better, jump for joy
Wordsworth: And sings a solitary song j That whistles in

Assonance: ‘Xeet feet sweep by sleeping geeks.’
Language games and language disguise, which have provided some of the
most useful evidence for investigating cognitive representations in sound
12 Between consonants at syllable margins, a phonetically predictable weak vowel is often heard (e.g.,
/blaq/‘good’[b@laq]and/slaq/‘farmland’[si
¯
laq];Huang2005).Egerod(1965)andLi(1980)arguedagainst
positing underlying schwas in the Atayal due to the predictability of the excrescent vowel. However,
Kaufman (2003), following the analysis of Rau (1992), contends that the animate actor focus marker is
underlyingly /@m/. Further investigation is needed to ascertain the underlying status of the weak vowel.
What is inWxation? 35
structures (Alidou 1997; Bagemihl 1988, 1995; Campbell 1986; Harrison and
Kaun 1999, 2001; Hombert 1986; Lehiste 1985; Piñeros 1998; Vago 1985), have
been argued to support the existence of sub-syllabic constituents, such as,
mora, onset/rhyme, and CV skeleton (cf. Yip 2003). For example, a language
game in Tigrinya inserts a -gV- sequence, where V is a copy of the preceding
vowel, after every vowel in the word.

Akin to the speech-error examples, there are also reports of apparent
segmental and sequence exchange in language disguise (Bagemihl 1995).
(49) Segmental exchanges
Tagalog: dito > doti ‘here’ (Conklin 1956)
Javanese: satus > tasus ‘100’ (Sadtano 1971)
Sequence exchanges
Hanunoo: rignuk > nugrik ‘tame’ (Conklin 1959)
Thai: khab rod > khod rab ‘to drive’ (Surintramont 1973)
Mandarin: ma > ma key > mey ka (Bao 1990; Yip 1982)
These phenomena provide strong support for the psychological reality of sub-
syllabic and skeletal units in language. A theory that bans such possibilities
a priori is far too restrictive. The bias against sub-prosodic units cannot be
maintained on theory-internal grounds either. The need to refer to skeletal
segmental units, like consonant and vowel, in the formulation of alignment is
not new. Prosodic constraints such as Onset and NoCoda, have been
formulated in terms of Generalized Alignment (Ito and Mester 1999;
McCarthy and Prince 1993a; Prince and Smolensky 1993; Yip 2003), which
crucially refer to edges of consonants and vowels directly.
(50) ALIGN (s, L, C, L) Onset
ALIGN (s, R, V, R) NoCoda
Formally, the alignment restriction of an inWx that targets the Wrst consonant
or the Wrst vowel is no diVerent from the syllable alignment constraints in
(50). In particular, skeletal units such as C and V occupy the existentially
quantiWed argument. The only distinction is that, in a morphological con-
straint, it is the aYx that occupies the universally quantiWed Wrst argument,
36 What is inWxation?
rather than a syllable. Thus the vexing question is not whether skeletal units
can enter into alignment relations, but why only skeletal units at particular
positions within a domain can be targeted.
In sum, the empirical and theoretical arguments demonstrate that the bias
against sub-prosodic constituents has no place in deciding the merit between
the Phonological Readjustment and the Phonological Subcategorization
approaches to inWxation. Given that both presumptions for the analytic
bifurcation (i.e., the ethological view of inWx placement and the prejudice
against sub-prosodic constituents) symptomatic of the constraint-based
approach to OT-PR are demonstrably not viable, it is diYcult to justify
maintaining Phonological Readjustment as a distinct analytic tool from
Phonological Subcategorization for the analysis of inWxation.
2.5.3 On the predictive power of the theory: Problems with overgeneration
Limitations of OT-PR run deeper than what has been mentioned thus
far, however. The basic appeal of OT-PR is that inWxation is explained as
essentially a repair strategy. Following the logic of the P >> M constraint
schema, output ill-formedness is ameliorated through aYx movement. Taken to
its logical extreme, this approach makes a queer prediction: under the right
conditions, an aYx may appear at the opposite edge of what its underlying
subcategorization speciWes. That is, a preWx may end up surfacing as a suYx,
and vice versa. To illustrate this, let us reconsider the case of Dakota agreement
inWxation. As noted earlier, agreement morphemes in Dakota are inWxed after
the initial syllable into polysyllabic verb roots of a lexically speciWed subclass.
However, the second-person dual marker u
˛(k) is preWxed to vowel-initial roots,
but is inWxed to consonant-initial ones.13

13 The allomorphs of the Wrst-person dual morpheme are actually uŒ, which is used before
consonants and uŒk before vowels (Moravcsik 1977: n. 57l).
14 These examples are taken from McCarthy and Prince (1993a: n. 26) who in turn cited them from
or constructed them on the basis of the description in Boas and Deloria 1941: 78–9.
What is inWxation? 37
According to McCarthy and Prince (1993a), this state of aVairs is due to the
force of the Onset constraint. Since Onset dominates ALIGN-ROOT, the
optimal, preWxal, candidate is u
˛.ka.li since it incurs one less onset violation
than the inWxing variant, a.u
˛.li. When the root is consonant-initial, however,
the preWxal candidate, u
˛.ma.nu, holds no such an advantage since both the
preWxal and inWxal candidates incur an equal level of Onset violations.
(52)

b. [|a- .li. **! *

This analysis, however, fails to account for why a candidate such as al-u
˛k-i (
ali), which shows the agreement morpheme embedded further inside the
root, does not prevail over the preWxal candidate u
˛k-ali. As shown in (53),
the hyper-inWxed candidate, alu
˛ki (53c) should be preferred over the preWxal
one (53a) since (53c) not only minimizes violations of Onset, but also satisWes
the high-ranking Align-Root constraint. The preWxal candidate, on the
other hand, will always fatally violate Align-Root. McCarthy and Prince
contend that the preWxal candidate is the preferred output in Dakota because
of a constraint enforcing integrity of root syllables. No independent empirical
support for this claim is forthcoming, however. The eVect of root syllable
integrity notwithstanding, the signiWcance of this illustration is clear. If inWxes
are indeed the result of the inward migration of peripheral aYxes (as pre-
dicted by the P >> M schema of constraint interaction), hyperinWxation
should be the norm, rather than the exception.

Consider now the case of Tagalog -um- inWxation. As described in (30), -um-
is treated formally as a preWx under OT-PR and is inWxed to avoid word-
initial onsetless outputs. Tagalog bans the occurrence of -um- after a labial

sonorant (i.e., OCP-um). When confronted with forms like *mumeri for um +
meri ‘to marry’, the Tagalog speaker returns an absolute ungrammaticality
judgment (see Orgun and Sprouse 1999 for further discussion). The fact of
ineVability notwithstanding, it is not hard to imagine a situation where a
speaker must produce an output. In such a case, the OT-PR approach predicts
hyperinWxation. Consider the scenario where -um- is applied to the hypo-
thetical loanword, wawana. From the point of view of avoiding onsetless
syllables, the optimal candidate should have been (54c). However, the high-
ranking OCP-um constraint, which prohibits -um- from appearing after a
labial sonorant, precludes this possibility. As it turns out, inWxing -um-
further inward oVers no relief since the medial consonant of the stem is also
a labial sonorant (54d). In order to avoid fatal violations of the high-ranking
constraints, the -um- preWx must realize as a suYx.

To be sure, this is not a problem unique to the gradient interpretation
of alignment. In his attempt to eliminate gradient constraint evaluation
in OT, McCarthy (2003b) reconceptualizes the nature of Alignment con-
straints by proposing a family of quantized alignment constraints, like those
in (55).
(55) Quantized ALIGN (Ft, Wd, R) (McCarthy 2003b: 3)
a. Align-by-Ft(Ft, Wd, R)
No foot stands between the right edge of Ft and the right edge of Wd.
b. Align-by-s(Ft, Wd, R)
No syllable stands between the right edge of Ft and the right edge of Wd.
c. Align-by-Seg(Ft, Wd, R)
No segment stands between the right edge of Ft and the right edge
of Wd.
What is inWxation? 39
Thus, for example, a constraint such as Align-by-Seg(-um-, Wd, L) requires
that no segment comes between the left edge of -um- and the left edge of a
word. Likewise, Align-by-s requires the left edge of a word and the left edge
of -um- not be separated by a syllable. Violations of these constraints are
accessed categorically because each constraint can be violated only once by a
candidate. As shown in (56), hyperinWxation obtains when the OCP-um
dominates these quantized alignment constraints.

McCarthy (2003b) notes that hyperinWxation can be curtailed if MParse(-um-),

emerges victorious over the other outputs in (57), since (57c) vacuously satisWes
all high-ranking constraints.

While it is possible to contrive a solution to the hyperinWxation problem, it
nonetheless misses the mark. To the best of my knowledge, hyperinWxation
is not attested in any of the world’s languages. A theory that predicts, as
the normal case, that inWxes should behave this way seems fundamentally
misconceived.15 To be sure, the hyperinWxation problem is really a problem
for the OTapproach to Prosodic Morphology in general. HyperinWxation will

always remain a theoretical possibility as long as phonotactic/prosodic
constraints can take precedence over constraints on aYx placement as li-
censed by the P >> M schema. Thus a rejection of hyperinWxation also calls
for a reevaluation of the nature of the morphology-phonology interface. I will
address this issue directly in the next chapter. Finally, it is also worth
highlighting the fact that the family of Align-by-X constraints exists solely
for the purpose of maintaining an OT-PR treatment of inWxation. No other
application of this family of constraints has thus far been identiWed. Thus, if a
theory can be called successful only to the extent that ‘it avoids positing its
own special rules, constraints, or principles that are invoked to analyze a
phenomenon but not applicable elsewhere’ (McCarthy 2003a: 177), then the
Align-by-X-based Phonological Readjustment analysis of inWxation is doubly
undesirable.
The converse of hyperinWxation is what I referred to as frivolous inWxation.
The logic of the OT-PR framework dictates that an aYx is only coerced to
move when the result of inWxation produces a more well-formed output;
otherwise, an aYx should remain at the periphery. Yet, non-prominence-
driven inWxes that have no adpositional counterpart are not diYcult to Wnd.
For example, in Alabama, a Muskogean language, the mediopassive -l- must
surface after the Wrst vowel of the stem, regardless of whether the stem is
consonant- or vowel-initial.
(58) Alabama mediopassive (Martin and Munro 2005)
takco ‘rope (v.)’ talikco ‘be roped’16
hocca ‘shoot’ holicca ‘be shot’
o:ti ‘make a Wre’ o:lti ‘kindling’
Or in Oaxaca Chontal, one method of plural formation is by inWxing -ł-
before the Wnal syllable of the singular regardless whether the singular form is
vowel-initial or vowel-Wnal.

approach has been called into question in recent years. Piggott (2000), for example, argues that
featural aYxation is better understood as a consequence of featural licensing, rather than the result of
displacement.
16 According to Martin and Munro (2005), an epenthetic i is inserted before consonant clusters in
Alabama and Koasati while a copy of the preceded vowel is inserted in the Western languages.

If inWxation is motivated by prosodic well-formedness (e.g., avoidance of
initial cluster or Wnal coda consonant, etc.), it is puzzling why the adWxal
option is not available in these languages (e.g., in Alabama *lo:ti or *o:til
instead of o:lti ‘kindling’). Similarly, in Archi, a Daghestanian language
spoken in the Caucasus, the number/class markers, -w-, -r-, and -b-, always
appear after the Wrst vowel of the stem, regardless of whether the stem is
vowel-initial or vowel-Wnal (Kibrik and Kodzasov 1988).
(60) daxi dabxdi ‘to churn (AOR, III)’ (Kibrik and Kodzasov 1988: 33)
ak’a abk’u ‘to drive (AOR, III)’ (Kibrik and Kodzasov 1988: 33)
axa abxu ‘to lie down (AOR, III)’ (Kibrik 1989: 458)
To be sure, a preWxal variant of the class markers is available. However, such
an option is only available when the post-initial vowel position is Wlled, for
example by the durative inWx -r- (e.g., ak’ar ‘to drive’ ! ark’ar ‘to drive,
DUR’ ! b-ark’ar ‘to drive, DUR, III’). On the view of the OT-PR approach,
all else being equal, the preWxal variant should be preferred since it reXects the
underlying adpositional nature of the aYx. The fact that the inWxal variant
has priority over the preWxal option in Archi highlights the fact that the inWxal
variant is the canonical position of the aYx while the preWxal variant is used
only when inWxation is not possible.
Kaufman (2003) proposes that the inWxability of an aYx is predictable
based on the aYxal properties of its paradigmatic neighbor. That is, if a
phonotactically suboptimal aYx belongs to a paradigm that contains phono-
tactically optimal neighbors, then no inWxation is predicted due to paradigm
uniformity. Conversely, if a phonotactically suboptimal aYx belongs to a
paradigm with other similarly suboptimal aYx(es), inWxation is predicted.
For example, in Ilokano, an Austronesian language spoken in the Philippines,
actor voice can be marked by either the preWx ag- or the inWx -um-.

At Wrst glance, the fact that these aYxes have diVerent surface distribution is
puzzling since both are VC in shape. Couched within the theory of Optimal
42 What is inWxation?
Paradigm (McCarthy 2003a), Kaufman (2003) contends that the reason why
/ag/ is preWxing in Ilokano is because it belongs to an aspectual paradigm
containing a consonant-initial form /nag/. On the other hand, /um/ is in a
paradigm with another VC aYx, /im(m)/. Assuming that the aYxes within
the same paradigm must be uniformed with respect to their alignment, a VC-
shaped aYx will be preWxed if it has a preWxal paradigmatic neighbor, but will
be inWxed if it has an inWxal paradigmatic neighbor. Following McCarthy’s
(2003b) OT-PR approach to inWxation, Kaufman argues that the inWxation of
/um/ and /im(m)/ is motivated by the avoidance of onsetless syllables in the
language (note the failure of (63b)).17 Onset violations may be avoided by way
of onset epenthesis (63c), but that would incur fatal violations of Depio-C,
which penalizes any epenthetic segment in the output.

and the left edge of a stem (McCarthy 2003b)

(McCarthy 2003b)
Anchoring-OP Assess a violation mark when the left edge of the
stem coincides with the left edge of the prosodic
word in one paradigm member but not in another.

The eVect of paradigm uniformity comes into play when paradigmatic mem-
bers incur diVerent markedness violations. As shown in (64), paradigm (64d),
where /ag/ is inWxed after the Wrst consonant of the root while /nag/ is
preWxed, is ruled out since it fatally violates Anchor-OP, which penalizes

paradigms with members showing non-matching stem-alignment relations.
An Anchor-OP violation cannot be ameliorated simply by inWxing both /ag/
and /nag/ (see (64a)) due to a fatal violation of *Complex incurred by the
inWxing of /nag/. While inWxing /nag/ further inward would avoid the *Com-
plex violation (64b), the inWxing paradigm remains suboptimal due to a fatal
violation of Align-by-s-L. The least costly strategy, as it turns out, is to
realize both /ag/ and /nag/ as preWxing (64c).

This Optimal Paradigm approach to inWxation is appealing since it avoids the
necessity of positing parochial alignment constraints that stipulate the pre-
Wxing nature of /ag/ and the inWxing distribution of /um/. The distribution of
these VC aYxes is derivative of the distribution of their paradigmatic neigh-
bor. This line of analysis, at Wrst glance, might provide a solution to the
frivolous inWxation problem. On this view, the aYxes in (58)–(60) might be
inWxing because their paradigmatic neighbors are of the nature that favors
inWxation. But a closer look at these cases suggests otherwise. To begin with,
while paradigm-based explanation is often invoked to better understand
inXectional morphology, it is unclear how paradigmatic relations should be
established in the case of derivational morphology. That is, in what paradig-
matic relationship should the mediopassive in Alabama or the plural marker
in Oaxaca Chontal participate? This quandary highlights a major weakness of
paradigm-based explanations. That is, paradigm-based explanations have no
explanatory force unless the notion of a paradigm can be deWned in some
rigorous fashion (Kenstowicz and Kisseberth 1977). To be sure, even within
the domain of inXectional morphology, the Optimal Paradigm is still hard
pressed to provide a principled explanation for the existence of frivolous
inWxation. For example, in the case of Archi, the class-number markers are
Wrst and foremost inWxal (65a–c). Only when in the constative/durative aspect
44 What is inWxation?
(CONST) are the class-number markers preWxal (65d). Like any OT-PR
analysis, the Optimal Paradigm approach to inWxation still requires some
displacement-triggering constraint to motivate phonological readjustment.
Yet, no obvious phonotactic or prosodic advantage can be adduced for
inWxing the class-number markers. Edge avoidance oVers no real solution in
this case since preWxing the class-number marker is in fact possible (65d).

True to the spirit of the ethological approach to inWxation, the Optimal
Paradigm approach to inWxation oVers an intriguing way to understanding
why morphemes of similar prosodic shape nonetheless have diVerent surface
distributions within the same language: namely, by capitalizing on the para-
digmatic nature of a certain type of morphology. However, such an approach
falters when the paradigmatic relation is either diYcult to motivate or
provides no useful information.
2.6 Conclusion
This chapter presents an overview of the nature of inWxation from both
descriptive and theoretical perspectives. Formally, inWxes have been treated as
either the result of phonological readjustment or as the result of morpho-
phonological mismatch due to phonological subcategorization. Previous
scholars have suggested that the Phonological Readjustment account, particu-
larly within the context of a constraint-based framework, is superior to the
subcategorization approach on the grounds of simplicity (e.g., Kaufman 2003;
McCarthy and Prince 1993a). That is, phonological readjustment-induced aYx
reordering, which results in surface inWxation, can be derived from constraint
interaction alone, an integral part of the explanatory machinery of Optimality
Theory. In particular, it is argued that the goal of simplicity demands that
predictable aspects of a surface form not be treated as part of its underlying
representation. However, following the logic of Occam’s Razor, simplicity
may only determine the superiority between theories that make comparable
predictions. As reviewed above, the Phonological Readjustment treatment of

What is inWxation? 45
inWxation is neither suYcient nor necessary. Phonological Readjustment is
inherently deWcient as a theory of inWxation since it is applicable only to a
subset of inWxal patterns in the world’s languages. In order to account for the
prominence-driven inWxes, advocates of Phonological Readjustment must
appeal to phonological subcategorization, the very machinery Phonological
Readjustment is ostensibly trying to eliminate. It should also be noted that
Phonological Subcategorization is no more complicated, if not in fact simpler,
than Phonological Readjustment since Phonological Subcategorization is stated
in terms of Generalized Alignment, a formal device that is also part of the
theoretical arsenal of Phonological Readjustment. Some researchers reject
Phonological Subcategorization on the grounds that it admits segmental
units into alignment relationship. But as noted earlier, the hypothesis that
only units in the prosodic hierarchy may enter into alignment relations, as
pointed out in McCarthy and Prince (1993a), is a matter of empirical observa-
tion, rather than a theoretical necessity. In fact, alignment involving segmental-
level information has been part of the theoretical arsenal since the inception of
Optimality Theory. Thus, to claim that Phonological Subcategorization is
somehow theoretically more burdensome than the Phonological Readjustment
approach due to its need to refer to segmental information in alignment
relations is misleading to say the least. Furthermore, as I will be demonstrating
in detail in the following chapters, not just any segmental level unit may enter
into alignment relations. Only a restricted set of subcategorizable phonological
units is observed.
Thus while it has achieved some signiWcant descriptive and analytic suc-
cesses, Phonological Readjustment includes much that is local and parochial
and therefore should be replaced by principles of broad applicability. Phono-
logical Subcategorization, understood in the context of a holistic framework
of linguistic explanation, provides just the right balance of empirical and
explanatory adequacy. To be sure, aspects of the Phonological Subcategoriza-
tion approach require further qualiWcation. For example, some might argue
that Phonological Subcategorization is overly powerful as it predicts align-
ment relationships between aYxes and phonological constituents in odd
positions within a word. That is, in its most basic formulation, it is possible
to set up a GA constraint that requires an aYx to subcategorize for, for
example, the third consonant of the root. At Wrst glance, such a prediction
seems to seriously undermine the viability of phonological subcategorization
as an insightful theory of inWx placement. Such an objection, however, is
misplaced from the perspective of the theory adopted in this monograph. The
next chapter explains why.

Subcategorization in context
The fundamental puzzle presented by the Edge-Bias EVect often confronts the
typologist: which factor(s) reduce the amount of conceivable variation across
languages down to the observed set? One method for the study of typology
and universals, which Greenberg refers to as dynamic comparison or dia-
chronic typology (1969), is to show that typological patterns emerge from
common diachronic changes in related and unrelated languages. This model
of linguistic evolution and change, in which the grammars of individual
languages emerge from the processes of change operative in all languages at
all times, as Bybee (forthcoming) points out, suggests that ‘the true universals
of language are the mechanisms of change that propel the constant creation
and re-creation of grammar.’1 The emphasis on the mechanisms of change
does not lessen the synchronic relevance of such an endeavor. Weinreich,
Labov, and Herzog (1968) were among the Wrst to recognize that the
diachronic and synchronic research programs share the same fundamental
goals; that is, the ‘constraints’ problem of determining possible and impos-
sible changes and the synchronic question of determining possible and
impossible human languages are essentially the one and the same pursuit.
From the point of view of current theories of linguistics, the starting point
for discussions of language change is acquisition, that is, the individual’s
acquisition of a grammar distinct from the one which underlies the output
of the preceding generation. The key to understanding the ‘error’ in grammar
transmission lies in the nature of the input for acquisition. The input data is
often wrought with ambiguities. The learner’s task is to Wnd a good match
between the input and the output of candidate grammars. In this chapter,
I will articulate a concrete, crucially holistic, model for understanding the
distributional properties of inWxes, as summarized in (1).
(1) A holistic theory of inWx distribution
a. Grammar-internal constraints:
A theory of phonological subcategorization (this chapter)
1 The quote is taken from the original pre-translated English version of the paper.
b. Grammar-external constraints:
constraints on morphological learning (Chapter 4)
constraints on morphological change (Chapter 5)
c. A theory of interaction between these grammar-internal and
grammar-external constraints (this chapter)
There are three main components to this model. First, I oVer a formal theory of
phonological subcategorization and, by extension, morphological subcategor-
ization that can express the full range of subcategorization relations in lan-
guage (Section 3.1). As illustrated in Chapter 2, when phonological constraints
take precedence over constraints on aYx placement, as in the case of OT-PR, the
undesirable eVect of hyperinWxation results. A more restrained model of the
morphology-phonology interface is needed to adequately model the distribu-
tional properties of inWxes. I show in Section 3.2 that such a theory is indeed
possible if the present theory of phonological subcategorization is situated
within a declarative uniWcation-based framework of grammatical analysis.
Allowing aYxes to target phonological constituents per se is not suYcient to
explain the restricted typology of inWx placement, however. As argued in Section
3.3, the model must also include a theory of how phonological subcategorization
interacts with grammar-external constraints imposed on morphological
learning and morphological change. Section 3.4 shows that a proper under-
standing of the synchronic typology of inWx distribution requires the theory of
aYx placement, indeed of grammar as a whole, to be embedded within a
temporal axis. The diachronic evolution of inWxes is as much an integral part
of the explanation as is their treatment within the synchronic grammar.
3.1 Subcategorization as Generalized Alignment
The approach to inWx placement argued in this work is the theory of
Phonological Subcategorization. Under this theory, inWxes are formally no
diVerent from preWxes and suYxes, except for the fact that, while preWxes and
suYxes target morphological constituents, inWxes target phonological ones.
When there is a mismatch between the targeted phonological constituent and
the morphological host, inWxation obtains. When the morphological
and phonological boundaries coincide, we Wnd adpositional aYxation. For
example, while the English preWx re- targets verbs (e.g., re-visit, re-read but
never re-beautiful since beautiful is an adjective), the expletive -bloody- in
certain varieties of English targets the left edge of a stressed foot (e.g., fan-
bloody-tástic, never *fantás-bloody-tic or *fantá-bloody-stic). Phonological
48 Subcategorization in context
Subcategorization inherits the insight of earlier subcategorization-based
theories, such as prosodic subcategorization (also known as prosodic align-
ment (McCarthy and Prince 1986)) and the Bi-dependent approach to
inWxation (Inkelas 1990; Kiparsky 1986), that inWxation involves the alignment
of a morphological entity with respect to a phonological one. However, it
breaks with Prosodic Subcategorization by eliminating the restriction that
allows only genuine prosodic categories to take part in morpho-phonological
alignment relationships (see also Inkelas 1990; Kiparsky 1986).
The present theory is anticipated in part by Anderson (1992), who proposes
a parameterized approach to aYx placement:
(2) Parameters for the placements of aYxes within a word:
(Anderson 1992: 210)
a. The aYx is located in the scope of some constituent which constitutes
its domain. This may be either a morphological constituent (the word-
structure head vs the entire word) or a prosodic one (prosodic word).
b. The aYx is located by reference to the {Wrst vs last vs main stressed}
element of a given type within the constituent in which it appears.
c. The aYx {precedes vs follows} the reference point.
In this work, I formalize an aYx’s subcategorization requirement in terms of
Generalized Alignment (McCarthy and Prince 1993a: 80). Subcategorization
restrictions are therefore constraints on proper edge alignment between
categories. A G(eneralized) A(lignment) constraint has four arguments: two
linguistic categories and one of the edges of each of the respective category.
The general formulation of a GA constraint is stated below:
(3) Align (Cat1, Edge1, Cat2, Edge2) ¼def
8 Cat1 9 Cat2 such that Edge1 of Cat1 and Edge2 of Cat2 coincide.
Where Cat1, Cat2 2 PCat [ GCat

The set of admissible GCat is derived from the morphological hierarchy stated
below:

The set of PCat, on the other hand, includes not only the categories within the
Prosodic Hierarchy including the level of the mora (i.e., ProsCat), but also
units on the CV skeletal tier.

Standard adpositional aYxation (i.e., morphological subcategorization) is
captured in this formalism in terms of the alignment of a GCat with respect
to another GCat. Phonological Subcategorization obtains when a designated
edge of a morphological constituent (CAT1) coincides with a designated edge
of a phonological pivot (CAT2) or vice versa. To illustrate this point more
concretely, let us revisit the case of Ulwa brieXy alluded to in Chapter 2. In
Ulwa, nouns have two forms: bare and aYxed. The aYxed variant is referred
to as the construct state. The construct state may appear as either an inWx or
a suYx, depending on various factors including the length of the stem and
its morphological make-up. Disyllabic roots may have either initial or Wnal
stress (see (6i)). In the construct state, however, stress is always iambic (6ii).
That is, main stress on a construct-state noun is on the Wrst syllable if it is
heavy; otherwise, it is on the second syllable. Crucially, the construct-state
marker always appears after the leftmost iambic foot of the stem.

Within the formalism of GA, the construct-state marker in Ulwa is formally
analyzed as aligning with respect to the right edge of the head iambic foot (7)
(i.e., the iambic foot that carries the main stress). Thus when the size of
the morphological host and the leftmost iambic foot coincide, the construct-
state marker appears suYxing (6a). When the morphological host of
50 Subcategorization in context
construct-state aYxation is larger than an iamb (i.e., in the case of a polysyllabic
noun or a disyllabic stem where the initial syllable is heavy), however, inWxation
obtains (6b).

ALIGN ([POSS]Af , L, FT’, R)
‘The left edge of the construct noun marker is aligned to the right edge
of the head foot.’
A notion central to the present theory of inWx placement is that of the pivot
point, which refers to the phonological unit to which an inWx attaches.2 To be
sure, the notion of the pivot is orthogonal to the notion of the base.
Throughout this study, the term base will be reserved for discussion speciWc
to reduplication. The term base will be taken as the morphological and/or
phonological domain from which the reduplicant copies.3 For example, in the
Pama-Nyungan language, Uradhi, pluractionality (PLR in gloss) is marked by
(C)CV reduplication:

Following the present terminological scheme, the pivot of internal reduplica-
tion is after the Wrst vowel of the stem; the base of reduplication is to the right
of the reduplicant:

2 Kiparsky (1986) uses the term ‘pivot’ to refer to the portion of a root over which an inWx ‘skips’.
The Kiparskyan understanding of the pivot is analogous to that of negative circumscription
(McCarthy and Prince 1990). A pivot is treated as a unit ignored for the purpose of aYxation. The
notion of pivot adopted here is similar to that of positive circumscription. A pivot is treated as the
circumscribed constituent to which an aYx attaches.
3 This dichotomy has been implicitly and explicitly assumed in the previous literature as the
distinction between aYx location and the direction of association (e.g., Broselow and McCarthy
1983/84; Clements 1985; Kiparsky 1986; Marantz 1982).
Subcategorization in context 51
Based on a typological survey (see Chapter 4 for details), I identify the
following set of phonological constituents that may enter into phonological
subcategorizing relations that result in inWxation:
(10) Potential pivots of inWxation
Edge pivots Prominence pivots
First consonant Stressed foot
First vowel Stressed syllable
(First syllable) Stressed vowel
Final syllable
Final vowel
(Final consonant)
The set of pivot points is subdivided into two types: pivots that occur at the
edge of a domain (edge pivots) and pivots that are deWned with respect to
lexical stress (prominence pivots). The GA formalization allows a four-way
typology of alignment relations between an aYx and its pivot (11).4 The aYx
and the pivot may enter into what is referred to as diVerent-edge alignment.
The right edge of an aYx may align with respect to the left edge of a pivot
or the left edge of an aYx may align with respect to the right edge of a
pivot. Such alignment relations essentially amount to the phonological
analogs to morphological preWxation and suYxation. More interesting,
however, is the notion of same-edge alignment, in which the left edges or
right edges of the aYx and the pivot coincide. As such, this type of align-
ment relation is unlike traditional adpositional relations. The aYx and the
pivot invariably overlap in the output when they are in a same-edge align-
ment relationship.
(11) DiVerent-edge alignment Same-edge alignment
Align (AYx, R, Pivot, L) Align (AYx, L, Pivot, L)
Align (AYx, L, Pivot, R) Align (AYx, R, Pivot, R)
I shall return to the issue of the pivot points in the next chapter. I will Wrst
articulate in more detail some of the formal issues raised by the adoption of
a GA formulation of subcategorization relations. GA is a tool for capturing
possible alignment relations between elements. Depending on the frame-
work in which this formalism is implemented, diVerent consequences
obtain. For example, as reviewed in Chapter 2, when GA is implemented
4 Here, I restrict my focus on just the range of alignment constraints predicted when the aYx
occupies the universally quantiWed argument. Section 6.4 in Chapter 6 brieXy considers the reverse
situation where the pivot point is in the universally quantiWed argument while the aYx is in the
existentially quantiWed one.
52 Subcategorization in context
in OT as rankable and violable constraints, the diVerent predictions of the
OT-PR approach to inWxation obtain. In the next section, I show that a
more restrictive theory of the morphology-phonology interface results when
phonological subcategorization as formalized in terms of GA is implemented
within a declarative model of the morphology-phonology interface.
3.2 Phonological Subcategorization in Sign-Based Morphology
The theory of Phonological Subcategorization presented in this work is
couched within the larger framework of Sign-Based Morphology (SBM)
(Orgun 1996, 1998, 1999; Orgun and Inkelas 2002). SBM is a declarative,
non-derivational theory of the morphology-phonology interface which
utilizes the basic tools one Wnds in any constituent structure-based uniWca-
tional approach to linguistics (e.g., Construction Grammar (Fillmore and
Kay 1994) and HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994). It assumes that terminal
and non-terminal nodes bear features and that non-terminal nodes also
include phonological information along with the usual syntactic and seman-
tic information (i.e., co-phonology (Inkelas 1998; Inkelas, Orgun, and Zoll
1997; Inkelas and Zoll 2005; Orgun 1996, 1999; Orgun and Inkelas 2002;
Yu 2000); and similar co-phonological approaches (Anttila 1997, 2002,
2006; Kiparsky 2000)). Morphological constructions are organized into a
type hierarchy, represented as a lattice with the maximally general type at
the top and the speciWc type at the bottom. This approach captures general-
izations across constructions by extracting such generalizations into a super-
type, thus providing a natural way to express which features are appropriate
to which kinds of items and what range of speciWcations are possible for the
value of a given attribute. A partial type hierarchy proposed in Koenig and
Jurafsky 1994 for English is given below (much detail is omitted to make the
hierarchy simpler):

Constraints imposed on all items of a given type are also stated as holding
on the general type. Constraints are signs represented as Attribute-Value
Matrixes (AVM). Signs are pairings of sound and meaning (Saussure 1916
[1986]). In SBM, a sign is a linguistic unit containing phonological infor-
mation as well as morphosyntactic and semantic features. Signs are repre-
sented as typed feature structures (Carpenter 1992) with attributes such as
phon and synsem. Since we are interested in the morphology-phonology
interface here, the value of the synsem attribute will be used here as a
convenient placeholder for glosses, or, when convenient, I will simply omit
this attribute. Thus, the sign representing the noun áytak ‘paper’ in Ulwa
will be:

AYxes may be treated in several ways in SBM. Here, I assume that aYxes are
represented as Wxed arguments to the phonological function (i.e., the w-
function), speciWed in aYxational constructions.5 Consider the schematic
representation of a morphologically complex structure in (14), which shows
the dominance relation between two signs, complex-stem and stem. The
indices 1, 2, and 3 indicate identity. This construction speciWes that a
well-formed sign of the type complex-stem consists of the synsem information
of the type stem (i.e., 1) mediated by the ı-function. The phonological
content of the complex-stem is an amalgamation of the phonological content
of the stem (i.e., 2) plus some aYxal element (i.e., 3). The aYxal element
essentially corresponds to the ‘underlying’ form of the aYx. The w-function is
responsible for any phonological adjustments (e.g., stress assignment, vowel
harmony, etc.) that are required to render the phonological content of the
complex-stem well-formed. The main innovation here is the addition of
the feature SubCat, which speciWes the linear position of an aYx relative to
some other unit. In the present case, the aYx (i.e., 3) is aligned with respect
to some phonological pivot.6
5 For a discussion of the advantages of the aYx-as-Wxed-argument approach over other concep-
tions of the aYx in SBM, see section 3.2.2 in Orgun 1996.
6 Previous SBM approaches to aYxation adopt the basic premise of OT-PR and assume that
the subcategorization requirement of the aYx is supplied as part of the constraint set of the w-
function.

For example, the construct-state noun áy-mana-tak ‘paper-CNS22’ in Ulwa is
licensed by the construction in (15). It shows that the input to forming a
construct-state noun is a noun stem. The aYx -mana- subcategorizes for the
right edge of a stressed foot. The subscript annotation on the w-function is a
reminder to the reader of which phonological alternations are enforced by w.
In the present case, the construct-state construction requires a construct-state
noun to bear iambic stress. Since stress is on the initial syllable, -mana-
appears as an inWx in the noun áytak ‘paper’.

In the last chapter, we saw that OT-PR enshrines the spirit of the ethological
view of aYx movement in the constraint-ranking schema, P >> M. Such
an approach is demonstrably inadequate not only because it runs into
problems of under- and overgeneration (by allowing aYxes to move around
for phonological repair reasons), but also because the ethological view of
inWx placement, which serves as the premise for the P >> M approach in
the Wrst place, is empirically suspect. Recent work has also highlighted
other problems associated with the P >> M theory (e.g., Paster 2006).
Subcategorization in context 55
In light of these shortcomings, the idea that phonological considerations may
trump morphological subcategorization ones is best avoided if the goal of a
restrictive and explanatory theory of inWxation is to be realized.
In the present theory, the inviolability of the subcategorization requirement
follows straightforwardly from the architecture of this model. Subcategoriza-
tion information is stated as part of the sign of the morphological construc-
tion. As declarative constraints are not violable, subcategorization restrictions
may never be violated as well. Given that aYx alignment cannot interact with
phonological constraints that are part of the phonological function of the
mother node, the phonological function is incapable of moving aYxes
around. The locus of the interface between morphology and phonology is
the interaction between constraints on prosody/phonotactics and faithfulness
within the w-function of the Phon feature. In particular, non-suppletive
phonologically conditioned allomorphy (e.g., English plural -s allomorphy)
occurs when prosodic/phonotactic constraints outrank the faithfulness con-
straints (i.e., P >> Faith). Allomorphy involving a diVerence in aYx align-
ment is thus treated as an instance of suppletive allomorphy; that is, the
allomorphs are assigned diVerent subcategorization requirements (see Paster
2006 for a thorough defense of this approach to other cases of phonologically
conditioned suppletive allormorphy). Consider once again the example of
Ulwa. As reviewed in the last chapter, the construct-state (CNS) markers in
Ulwa are generally aYxed to the right edge of an iambic foot. However, there
is a lexically arbitrary class of nouns that takes the construct-state morpheme
as a simple suYx (16).

Prince 1993a)
gobament gobament-ka ‘government’
abana abana-ka ‘dance’
bassirih bassirih-ka ‘falcon’
ispiri˛ ispiri˛-ka ‘elbow’
Since the classes of lexical items that take the inWxing rather than the
suYxing allomorphs of the construct-state morpheme are arbitrary, two
inXectional classes in the lexical type hierarchy must be posited: class 1 and
class 2. Noun stems must belong to one of these two classes. There are two
methods of forming construct-state nouns in Ulwa (17). Each construct-
state construction speciWes which noun class may serve as its morphological
daughter.

Phonological Subcategorization, when implemented properly in SBM, pro-
vides a restrictive account of the morphology-phonology interface. In
particular, the phonological function is strictly evaluative; it interprets the
phonological exponents of a morpheme in accordance with the phonotactics
of the language, but does not alter the morph’s underlying distributional
restriction.
Recall now that the Phonological Readjustment approach accounts for
the Edge-Bias EVect by assuming that edge-oriented inWxes are underlying
preWxes and suYxes; movement from its original position is minimal, hence
the peripheral distribution. This explanation of the Edge-Bias EVect is there-
fore grammar-internal; ethological/functional motivations for inWxation are
derived from the intrinsic properties of the grammar. In Chapter 2, I reviewed
Subcategorization in context 57
the obstacles such an explanation faces and concluded that Phonological
Readjustment is not a viable theory of inWxation. The present theory
of Phonological Subcategorization is formulated in terms of Generalized
Alignment. GA is a constraint schema that makes possible the encoding of
the formal relations between basic grammatical elements in a transparently
compositional fashion. SpeciWc phonological subcategorization constraints
are therefore language-speciWc constraints since they operate at the level of
individual aYxes rather than on general universally available constituents.
Such a model of constraint building invariably leads to the problem of
constraint overgeneration. That is, not all formally possible combinations
of PCat and GCat arguments lead to alignment constraints that are attested.
For example, it would be quite unexpected to Wnd an aYx that subcategorizes
solely for the third syllable of a word or the fourth mora of the root. As such,
the formalism of GA shows no intrinsic bias toward any particular grammat-
ical element; the Edge-Bias EVect is thus not part of the explanatory purview
of GA or that of Phonological Subcategorization per se. In the next section,
I will argue that the unabashedly non-ethological nature of GA and its over-
generating capacity is not only not an obstacle toward a restrictive theory of
inWxation; it is, in many respects, desirable.
3.3 Phonological Subcategorization and constraint overgeneration
Constraint overgeneration is not unique to GA/Phonological Subcategoriza-
tion. As reviewed in Smith (2002, 2004), constraint overgeneration is symp-
tomatic of theories that generate constraints from a small set of formal
relations and basic grammatical elements. For example, a generalized feature
co-occurrence schema, such as *[Fea1, Fea2], would generate co-occurrence
constraints for all pairs of features, regardless of whether the features are
physically incompatible or not. Solutions to the constraint overgeneration
problem have generally assumed that excess constraints can be ruled out with
constraint Wlters. Many such constraint Wlters are argued to be functionally or
substantively motivated (Hayes 1999; Smith 2002, 2004). Within the frame-
work of Optimality Theory, the grammar is conceived as a set of violable
constraints and their interactions. Languages diVer only in terms of the
ranking of the members of the universal set of violable constraints, Con.
With these assumptions in mind, Smith (2002, 2004) proposes a Schema/
Filter model of the Con component, in which a set of constraint Wlters
inspects the constraints that are freely generated by the schemas and admits
into Con only those formally possible constraints that meet the criteria of
the Wlters. The Wlters may be functionally motivated in that they make use
58 Subcategorization in context
of articulatory, acoustic, perceptual, or other substantive information to
distinguish between legitimate and undesirable constraints.

While I agree with this approach of using Wlters to combat the overgenera-
tion problem, the main innovation of this work, and its chief divergence
from previous work dealing with the constraint overgeneration problem, is
the proposed division of labor between components within a holistic theory
of language. Recall that while OT constraints are assumed to be universal,
declarative constraints in sign-based models of the grammar are language-
speciWc constraints that are post hoc generalizations over a lexicon. Infor-
mation on subcategorization requirements is no exception. It may thus be
hypothesized that the task of a language learner is to construct declarative
constraints on subcategorization requirements based on the ambient
language environment. Formally, a learner is assumed to be equipped with
the knowledge of the GA schema and her task is to Wll the variable slots
with arguments of the correct type based on the available data. Subcategor-
ization requirements might change as the lexicon is updated. Evidence
for this dynamic and usage-based view of subcategorization requirement
formation can be found in the case of variable inWxation. For example, in
Tagalog, the agentive focus marker may be analyzed as aligning with respect
to either the Wrst vowel or the Wrst consonant, if only the native lexicon
is considered.
(19) b-um-ilih ‘X buys/bought’
t-um-alikod ‘X turns/turned his back to’
b-um-agsak ‘X fails/failed’
?-um-akyat ‘X climbs/climbed’
Given the ambiguity inherent in the identiWcation of phonological pivots, it is
to be expected that, if subcategorization is usage-based, speakers should be
able to exploit this analytic ambiguity. The variable inWxation evidence (20) is
consistent with this prediction. That is, when the root begins with a conson-
ant cluster, the inWx -um- can appear after the Wrst consonant, thus inter-
rupting the cluster, or before the Wrst vowel (see Orgun and Sprouse 1999;
Zuraw 2005 for more discussions).

plantsa plumantsa  pumlantsa ‘iron’

A similar, but more complicated pattern is observed with respect to the
perfective aYx -in- in Tagalog. Avery and Lamontagne (1995) report that -in-
may appear after the Wrst consonant or before the Wrst vowel of the stem.
However, this variation is partly conditioned by the placement of stress. Two
patterns are reported in particular. Avery and Lamontagne describe Pattern A
as follows: ‘[i]f the base-accent is an odd number of syllables from -in-, -in- will
occur after C1 and an epenthetic vowel appears immediately following -in-.’
An epenthetic vowel is capitalized in Avery and Lamontagne’s transcription.

prı́to i-p-in-I-rı́to ‘fried’
Pattern B shows that ‘if the base-accent is an even number of syllables from
-in-, -in- will occur after either C1 or C2. If it occurs after C1, metathesis may
apply [see (22b), A. Y.].’
(22) Pattern B of Tagalog perfective inWxation

klipán k-in-lipán/kl-in-ipán ‘cremated’
promót p-in-romót/pr-in-omót ‘promoted’
b. trabáho t-in-arbáho ‘worked’
Variable inWxation in Tagalog, as is obvious from the examples above, is the
consequence of loanword borrowing (Yip 2002, 2003, 2006; Zuraw 1996,
2005). The native Tagalog lexicon lacks initial consonant clusters. Thus, a
speaker of Tagalog must decide where the inWx may appear when confronted
with the need to perform inWxation on loanwords with initial consonant
clusters. Since the existing pattern of the actor focus and perfective inWxation
patterns support both the post-Wrst-consonant and the pre-Wrst-vowel
analyses, speakers are free to entertain either analysis.7
7 Zuraw (1996) accounts for the variable inWxation patterns in Tagalog by proposing the possibility
of Xoating constraints in Optimality Theory, whose ranking has never been crucial to the language in
question until the proper test case is introduced, for example, in loanword borrowing.
60 Subcategorization in context
That grammatical constraints may be derived rather than supplied by Wat is
not itself a radical idea. Much research from the usage-based perspective has
argued for the viability and indeed necessity of such an emergent approach to
linguistics (e.g., Bybee 2001; Bybee 1985a, 1985b, 1995; Elman et al. 1996; Goldberg
1999, 2006; MacWhinney 1999; Tomasello 2003). Hayes (1999), for example,
proposes an algorithm to derive the appropriate set of formal phonological
constraints through inductive grounding. The question that must be addressed
here is what the Wlters are that regulate the formation of alignment require-
ments. I share with Smith the assumption that Wlters are functionally based.
That is, they are grounded in constraints on speech perception and production
and cognitive factors in language acquisition. However, unlike the Filter/Schema
model, which assumes that the Wlters serve an inspection role, weeding out
undesirable constraints after the set of constraints has already been constructed,
I maintain that the relation between Wlters and grammatical constraint con-
struction is indirect. While certain Wlters prevent grammatical constraints from
emerging during the language acquisition process, the eVects of other Wlters are
apparent only in the corpus of data available to the learner. That is, such Wlters
eliminate impossible utterances or restrict the frequency and distribution of
highly improbable ones. As I shall argue below, in the case of subcategorization
restriction formation, there are two main Wlters that eliminate improbable or
impossible alignment relations. On the one hand, there are inductive biases in
morphological acquisition that block certain alignment relations from being
admitted to Con, or from being set up as proper signs. On the other hand, the
nature of morphological change itself restricts the range of reanalysis-inducing,
ambiguous contexts that are conducive to the creation of inWxes. The diachronic
Wlter does not weed out constraints per se. Certain alignment relations are
not possible because no available data, or not enough data, support their
construction in the Wrst place. The general model of the interplay between
grammar-external forces and formal theory in the construction of linguistic
signs is presented below:

This model is similar to the model proposed in Hume and Johnson 2001 for
the interplay of external forces and phonological theory in that external
Subcategorization in context 61
factors may directly inXuence cognitive representations, but have only an
indirect inXuence on formal phonological theory itself (see also Barnes 2002,
2006; Hume 2004; Kavitskaya 2001; and Mielke 2004 for similar proposals). To
the extent that linguistic patterns are shaped by external factors, these factors
are only reXected in the formal theory; the formal theory itself does not make
direct reference to such functional factors. This model of sign construction
and its relation to the Wlters thus diverges signiWcantly from the assumptions
of the traditional OTmodel, which assumes that the constraint set is universal
across all languages. The present model has several advantages over the
traditional OT model. The language-speciWc nature of alignment constraints
has been a constant source of embarrassment for Optimality Theory since GA
constraints are often formulated for language-speciWc aYxes. The force of
such an objection is much diminished if the subcategorization constraints are
consigned to the declarative component of the grammar. The fact that
alignment constraints are gradiently evaluated has also come under attack
in recent years. This has led McCarthy (2003b) to propose eliminating
gradiently evaluated alignment constraints entirely. However, in order to
preserve the Phonological Readjustment analysis of inWxation, a new set of
categorically evaluated alignment constraints are posited (see discussion in
Section 2.5.3 in Chapter 2). The necessity of such Alignment-by-X constraints,
where X stands for a host of segmental and prosodic constituents, is suspect,
given that they are only needed to preserve an OT-PR account of edge-
oriented inWxes; the Alignment-by-X constraints have no application outside
of this very restricted domain. In the present theory, there is no need for such
inWxation-speciWc constraints since the categorical nature of subcategoriza-
tion constraints follows naturally from the declarative nature of a sign-based
grammar. Thus, from the perspective of the present theory, the burden of the
explanatory power is distributed. The mechanism of Phonological Subcat-
egorization governs what subcategorization requirements may be formulated
and SBM regulates how such subcategorization restrictions are situated
within the grammar. These two components of the theory are unabashedly
silent with respect to the Edge-Bias EVect. The distributional bias of inWxes is
derived from external factors (i.e., the ‘‘Wlters’), which I shall elaborate further
in the next section.
3.4 Understanding the Edge-Bias EVect
Thus far, I have articulated only a theory of phonological subcategorization.
Phonological subcategorization is formalized in terms of Generalized
Alignment, which, in turn, is couched within the theory of Sign-Based
62 Subcategorization in context
Morphology. The declarative nature of linguistic signs in SBM captures
straightforwardly the non-violability of subcategorization requirements in
general. I have proposed that the overgenerating nature of the Generalized
Alignment schema is curbed by external Wlters operating on the linguistic
inputs through which subcategorization restrictions are derived. Two main
grammar-external factors are crucial to understanding the current state of
inWx distribution. The next two chapters are dedicated to explicating the
nature of these external Wlters. However, to put them in perspective, in this
section, I brieXy lay out the overall framework.
As foreshadowed in the beginning of this chapter, the starting point of
understanding the synchronic typology of inWxation, indeed any linguistic
phenomenon in general, is the study of its diachronic typology. The study of
language change is, however, inextricably linked to the study of language
acquisition. That is, changes in language are by and large the results of
misanalysis or misperception of the input data to learning (e.g., Blevins
2004; Ohala 1983, 1993). Misparsing, from the level of features to the level of
phrasal constituents, may lead to reanalysis (Hopper and Traugott 1993: ch. 3).
The reanalyzed structures may then propagate through analogical extension.
There is ample evidence in support of this view of new construction emer-
gence. InWxation is no exception. InWxes emerge out of ambiguity-induced
morphological misparsing. InWxes are predominantly edge-oriented because
the set of ambiguity-induced changes that lead to the development of inWxa-
tion and the mechanism of subcategorization formation during language
transmission conspire toward outcomes that favor edge-oriented inWxes.
Consider the following scenario: let us assume that there exists historically an
aYx, X, and a set of diVerent aYxes, A. X must preWx directly to a set of roots, B,
while A may preWx directly to B or XB. For simplicity’s sake, let us also assume
that A is present in all output forms that contain X. At some later stage, the
morphological independence of A is lost and the AB complex fused to form a set
of new roots, RARB, where RA corresponds to the set of historical aYxes A, while
RB corresponds to the set of historical roots B. At this stage, the distribution of X
is ambiguous: X may be subcategorizing for RA, for RB, or for some prosodic
correlates of them. Principles of morphological learning help the learner decide
on the proper subcategorization relation for X. The new distribution of X may
then be extended to roots that are historically monomorphemic.

The inWxing pattern is analogically
extended to roots that were historically
monomorphemic.
Given this understanding of the origins of inWxation, the main task of
explaining the Edge-Bias EVect is to understand the range of linguistic
changes that might give rise to ambiguities in morphological parsing, as
well as the principles of morphological learning that facilitate the formation
of appropriate subcategorization relations. For example, as will be reviewed in
detail in Chapter 5, the particular linguistic change scenario presented in (24)
is known as entrapment. The historical preWx, X, is sandwiched in between a
set of historical preWxes and roots. Chapter 5 explores in detail this and other
mechanisms of language change that can give rise to inWxes. I will show that
the set of diachronic pathways that lead to inWxation is very small, which in
turn has the eVect of restricting the set of possible inWxes that might be
generated. In particular, these pathways point to the fact that inWxes are
predominately historical adpositional aYxes. Their original peripheral
distributions are reXected in their peripheral inWxal distribution (i.e., the
Wrst source of the Edge-Bias EVect).
To be sure, the trajectory of change is often non-deterministic. That is,
ambiguities can often be resolved in multiple ways. InWxation is often only
one of many competing solutions. Ideally, a theory of language and of
language change in particular should provide principled explanations for
what Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog (1968) refer to as the ‘actuation’ problem.
Here, I shall not attempt to accomplish such a tall order. In the next chapter,
I have limited my goal to answering a more modest question. That is, given
an ambiguous context in which a speaker is presented with multiple subcat-
egorization analyses, what types of inductive bias might help the speaker settle
on a unique solution? For example, which factor(s) decide which pivot
(e.g., RA or RB) the inWx, X, in (24) should subcategorize for? Thus, equally
important to the understanding of the Edge-Bias EVect is the mechanism that
64 Subcategorization in context
allows learners to decide what subcategorization restriction is appropriate for
a particular morphological construction. A theory of inductive bias, called the
Pivot Theory, is introduced in the next chapter. The Pivot Theory is essen-
tially a bootstrapping mechanism in morphological learning that helps the
learner narrow down the space of possible subcategorization restrictions
describing the distribution of an emergent inWx to variable degrees of success.
Since edge pivots (and prominence pivots) are more salient and more reliable
than other potential pivot points, learners are more likely to set up phono-
logical aYxes that target these edge pivots (i.e., the second source of the Edge-
Bias EVect). Chapter 4 also lays out the synchronic typology of inWxation
using the diVerent pivot points as a classiWcation scheme. I will also demon-
strate how these inWxes may be analyzed within an SBM-based Phonological
Subcategorization approach to inWxation. The presentation of the syn-
chronic typology of inWxation will set the stage for the presentation of the
diachronic typology in Chapter 5.

Pivot Theory and the typology
In the preceding chapter, I have asserted that the distribution of inWxes is
governed by a restricted set of phonological pivots that enter into phono-
logical subcategorization relations with morphological units. This limited set
of phonological pivots can be subdivided into two main categories: edge
pivots and prominence pivots (1).
(1) Potential pivots of phonological subcategorization
Edge pivots Prominence pivots
First consonant Stressed foot
First vowel Stressed syllable
(First syllable) Stressed vowel
Last syllable
Last vowel
(Last consonant)
The main problem to be addressed in this chapter is to what extent it is
possible to delineate the set of attested phonological pivots without resorting
to stipulation. This chapter is devoted to articulating and substantiating a
theory of what constitutes a possible phonological pivot in language. Section
4.1 advances a theory of one major source of inductive bias that is crucial for
morphological learning, called the Pivot Theory. Up till this point, I have
refrained from laying out the synchronic typology of inWxation in detail. This
chapter confronts this head on. The heart of this chapter is an exploration
of the general typology of inWxation organized by pivot positions (Sections
4.2–4.8). I will set out any broad descriptive generalizations which emerge
from the typological investigation, as well as illustrations of how inWxes might
be accounted for within the declarative framework laid out in Chapter 3.
4.1 The Pivot Theory
The main proposal defended in this section is the idea that the morphological
learning algorithm is biased toward a phonological subcategorization rela-
tionship that is built upon certain phonological pivot points. In particular,
phonological pivots must be perceptually and psycholinguistically salient,
where salience may include factors such as ease of recoverability and
facilitation in language processing and lexical retrieval. I shall refer to this as
the Salient Pivot Hypothesis:
(2) Salient Pivot Hypothesis
Phonological pivots must be salient at the psycholinguistic and/or
phonetic level.
The idea that certain positions in a word are privileged in the grammar has a
long pedigree. As early as Trubetzkoy (1939: 22), it has been recognized that
phonological contrasts are sustained to variable degrees depending on the
positions of the word. Most relevant to the present discussion is the fact that
certain positions in a word are ‘strong’ in that they are either the sole locus
licensing a contrast, or that they are more resistant to reduction (e.g., Barnes
2002, 2006; Beckman 1997, 1999; J. L. Smith 2002, 2004; Zhang 2001). For
example, Smith (2004) argues that positional augmentation constraints are
relativized only to phonologically prominent or ‘strong’ positions, which
include the stressed syllable, the released consonants (often the onset of a
syllable), the long vowel, the initial syllable, and the morphological root. The
Wnal syllable is also a domain of some prominence. Phonologically, certain
contrasts are found to be preferentially licensed in Wnal syllables (e.g., tone
and vocalic contrasts: M. Gordon 1999; Zhang 2001). In acquisition, children
are most likely to retain internal-stressed syllables and Wrst and Wnal syllables
(Kehoe and Stoel-Gammon 1997; Peters 1983). Past research has also shown
that the edges of words are psycholinguistically prominent. For example,
Shattuck-Hufnagel (1992) argues that the Wrst consonant of a word is promi-
nent based on lexical retrieval evidence. Beckman (1999) argues that initial
and stressed syllables are more prominent based on the fact that they generally
license a greater array of phonological contrasts than syllables in other
positions. As summarized in (3), the set of phonological pivots is a proper
subset of the phonologically and psycholinguistically prominent positions.

68 Pivot Theory and the typology
This correlation is signiWcant. The fact that the set of phonological pivots
converges with the set of phonologically and psycholinguistically prominent
positions suggests that the Salient Pivot Hypothesis is on the right track.
As noted in Chapter 3, a learner is equipped with knowledge of the GA
schema and her task is to Wll the variable slots with arguments of the correct
type based on the available data. The representation of morphological
processes, which involves generalizations over the distinction between
stems and aYxes, emerges as the result of appropriate associations between
formatives (e.g., Albright 2002; Albright and Hayes 2003; Bybee 1995;
Bybee 2001). The reliability of a ‘rule’ or subcategorization requirement, in
the present context, posited by the learner, depends on how well the
subcategorization restriction accounts for the data and how widely a pattern
is attested. Albright (2002), for example, proposes the following evaluation
metric to quantify the reliability of a rule.
(4) DeWnition of a rule’s reliability:
# of forms included in the rule’s structural change (¼hits)
#of forms included in the rule’s structural description (¼scope)
Extending this metric to evaluating the reliability of subcategorization restric-
tions, I propose that subcategorization restrictions with the highest reliability
value are the ones that are adopted. Thus, for example, consider the
hypothetical language in (5), where verbs are inXected with the inWx -ka-.
(5) verb root inXected form
mata  makata
vire  vikare
famile  famikale
tenupik  tenukapik
Assuming the inXected forms are derived from the verb roots, at least three
subcategorization frames are possible for deriving the ka-inXected forms (in
order to simplify the complexity of the example here, only subcategorizations
stated at the level of the syllable are considered):
(6) a. Align (ka, L, s1, R) i.e., #[s]ka . . .
b. Align (ka, L, s2, R) i.e., #[ss]ka . . .
c. Align (ka, R, slast, L) i.e., . . . ka[s]#
The post-initial syllable subcategorization (6a) has a structural description
that covers all four words, but -ka- is after the Wrst syllable in only two words.
Thus, the reliability of this subcategorization restriction is 2/4 ¼ 0.5. Similarly,
the post-second syllable subcategorization (6b) has the same reliability ratio
Pivot Theory and the typology 69
as (6a), since (6b) also has a structural description that covers all four words,
but only two show ka appearing two syllables away from the left edge of the
word. The pre-Wnal syllable subcategorization (6c), on the other hand, has a
reliability ratio of 1, since its structural description covers all four words and
all four show -ka- before the Wnal. (In Albright’s model, the reliability
ratios are further adjusted using lower conWdence limit statistics to yield a
conWdence value (Mikheev 1997); thus a reliability ratio of 2/4 ¼ 0.5 is
assigned a conWdence of 0.31). A learner of this hypothetical inXectional
pattern is predicted to select (6c) as the subcategorization restriction for
-ka- since it has the highest reliability value.
Based on this metric for evaluating the reliability of a subcategorization
requirement, it is hardly surprising that salient pivot points are singled out for
the purpose of establishing subcategorization relations. The phonological
pivots in (1) are most reliable since such pivots are most likely to be estab-
lished across stems. That is, if a language were to have any phonologically
subcategorizing aYxes at all, it is likely to have aYxes subcategorizing
for some phonological element within the Wrst or the last syllable since
subcategorization frames that target these pivots have the best chances of
holding true across most roots/stems (7). Prominence (i.e., lexical stress) is
predicted to be a legitimate pivot as well, since it is likely to be a feature of all
content words in the stress-marking language.

70 Pivot Theory and the typology
A similar rationale has been invoked to account for the property of demarcative
stress. Hyman (1977), in his treatment of the typology of primary stress location,
observes that demarcative primary stress is most often assigned to the Wrst or the
last syllable. In his survey of 444 languages, he found 114 languages with initial
stress and 97 with Wnal stress. Hyman explains this tendency for demarcative
stress to be at the word boundary in the following way (see also Kurylowicz
1958: 375 n.):
One problem with assigning stress too far from a boundary is that short words may
require a separate treatment. In a language with third syllable stress, a bisyllabic word
should presumably get initial stress, while a monosyllabic word would receive stress
on its only syllable. It is only initial and Wnal stress which allow a general statement
without complication. (Hyman 1977: n. 16)
The basic tenor of Hyman’s observation is clear. All else being equal, one
expects the site of a linguistic operation, be it stress assignment or inWxation,
to be easily identiWable regardless of the shape of the word. The edges and the
stressed domain of a stem are just such locations. The diVerence between stress
and inWx placement is that the proper placement of stress often hinges on other
factors (e.g., syllable weight, foot form/structure, etc.), while inWxation shows
no such dependencies. The pressure to posit a subcategorization restriction
with maximal generality might also have to do with the nature of abductive
reasoning involved in language learning. Abductive reasoning, in contrast with
inductive and deductive reasoning, ‘proceeds from an observed result, invokes
a law, and infers that something may be the case’ (Andersen 1973: 775). Thus
when a learner confronts an ambiguity in morphological parsing, she may
reason that, given that grammatical rules are generally transparent and
exceptionless, the distribution of an aYx must also be maximally reliable
and exceptionless. Generalizations that are exception-ful (or demonstrably
false a priori) are unlikely to hold up in an abductive reasoning process.
The Pivot Theory not only provides a mechanism by which the set of
phonological subcategorization relations can be established, it also provides
a handy scheme for typologizing inWxes. One of the main goals of the
typological survey below, besides showing the range of inWxation patterns
from a cross-linguistic perspective, is to provide a descriptively adequate
system for the purpose of inWx classiWcation. The pivot approach provides
an eYcient mechanism to reduce the complexity of the typology, and it allows
generalizations to emerge that might be missed under previous approaches.
Take, for example, the cases of English expletive inWxation and Ulwa
construct-state inWxation. In the case of English expletive inWxation, the
expletive appears to the left of a stressed foot.

As alluded to in earlier chapters, the construct-state (CNS) markers in Ulwa
are aYxed to the right edge of an iambic stressed foot.

According to the theory of pivot points, both the English and the Ulwa cases
are classiWed under the same pivot point, namely, the stressed foot. However,
in Ultan’s (1975) classiWcation scheme, for example, the English and Ulwa
patterns would appear under distinct categories. In particular, Ultan (1975),
who based his survey on seventy-Wve languages, suggests that there are
basically eight patterns of inWxation. (The same typology is adopted in
Moravcsik 2000.)
(10) Ultan’s (1975) inventory of inWxation
After initial consonant
After initial vowel
After initial syllable
Before second consonant
After second consonant
After second syllable
Before Wnal consonant

Under this classiWcation scheme, English expletive inWxation falls under the
Before-a-Stressed-Foot category while the Ulwa construct-state marker falls
under the After-a-Stressed-Foot category. An obvious opportunity is missed
to connect two seemingly disparate patterns.
72 Pivot Theory and the typology
The pivot approach not only oVers a more insightful way to typologize
inWxes, it often allows a more simpliWed description of inWxal patterns as
well. For example, in Paiwanic reduplication, the reduplicant may appear
as suYxing when the root is vowel-Wnal and inWxing when the root is
consonant-Wnal. Since after the Wnal vowel is not amongst the set of possible
inWxal locations, under Ultan’s classiWcation scheme, the Paiwanic pattern
would have to be classiWed as simultaneously suYxing and aYxing before the
Wnal consonant. The pivot approach, however, treats the reduplicant as
appearing after the Wnal vowel and requires no special stipulation about the
nature of the Wnal consonant.

For the remainder of this chapter, I lay out the typology of inWxation using
the pivot point classiWcation schema. In what follows, I shall Wrst focus on
inWxes that target the edge-pivots before proceeding to the prominence
pivots. Before diving into the typological survey, however, I will brieXy
review the nature of the typological database from which I draw my
observations.
4.2 Sampling procedures
This survey is based on a database of 154 inWxation patterns from 111
languages of 26 diVerent phyla and isolates. A summary of the languages
surveyed can be found in the Appendix. In a typological study of any scale, the
methodology of sample selection and coding is critical for the ultimate
validity of any typological claims derived from the data. Given the relative
scarcity of inWxation in the world’s languages, the main guiding principle in
compiling the present database is ‘the more the merrier’. Languages without
inWxes were not surveyed, as the main goal of this research is to consider
the internal diversity of languages with inWxes, rather than the typological
distribution of languages with inWxes. This methodological choice has led
Pivot Theory and the typology 73
to certain unavoidable impasses where arbitrary decisions were made.
Such decisions will be presented here as clearly as possible in the hope
that the reader will be suYciently informed in order to avoid potential
confusion.
Since inWxes, more often than not, occupy a relatively small corner of most
grammatical descriptions, the thoroughness of their treatment often leaves
much to be desired. Thus, I established a minimal requirement for an inWx-
ation pattern to be included in the database: the level of description of an
inWxation construction must be suYcient to address the majority of the main
coding categories in the database (i.e., language name, genetic aYliation,
inWx shape, inWx location, and examples). Wherever information is available,
basic facts regarding stress assignment and the semantic import of the inWx are
also recorded. The sources come chieXy from reference grammars, teaching
grammars, journal articles, and entries in language handbooks. These mater-
ials tend to emphasize the formal aspects of the inWx, but give relatively few
details regarding the meaning and productivity of the construction.
While data from secondary sources, such as short illustrations given in the
theoretical literature, are included, I have made an eVort to conWrm the data
from original sources when possible. Patterns where the original source was
unavailable are included in the database only if enough data are provided in
the secondary source to support the description given.
The genetic aYliation information of each language recorded is based
on the Web edition of the Ethnologue, published by the Summer Institute
of Linguistics. The Ethnologue is employed here mainly for its compreh-
ensiveness and its easily searchable database. No attempt was made a priori
to form a genetically balanced database, but this situation is not as proble-
matic as it might seem; the Wnal corpus nevertheless contains languages
from twenty-Wve language phyla from all major geographic areas. (See the
Appendix for the genetic aYliation of languages with inWxation.)
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that, while a set of inWxation patterns
might have a single historical source, the patterns’ synchronic manifestations,
more often than not, diverge quite markedly across daughter languages. The
inWx -um- found in the many languages of the Austronesian family is a case in
point. Despite the fact that the function of this inWx varies dramatically
across the daughter languages, it is well established that this inWx must
be reconstructed in Proto-Austronesian (Dahl 1976). This inWx invariably
appears toward the left edge of the stem. However, individual daughter
languages diVer on the treatment of this inWx with respect to stems that
contain an initial onset cluster. Consider the following data from three
Austronesian languages, Atayal, Chamorro, and Tagalog.
74 Pivot Theory and the typology
(12) Atayal animate actor focus (Egerod 1965: 263–6)
qul qmul ‘snatch’
kat kmat ‘bite’
kuu kmuu ‘too tired, not in the mood’
h˛u? hm˛u? ‘soak’
skziap kmziap ‘catch’
sbil smbil ‘leave behind’
Chamorro verbalizer, actor focus (Topping 1973: 185)

Tagalog focus construction (Orgun and Sprouse 1999)
gradwet grumadwet  gumradwet ‘to graduate’
plantsa plumantsa  pumlantsa ‘iron’
preno prumeno  pumreno ‘to brake’
A quick comparison between three daughter languages of the Austronesian
family reveals several interesting observations. The inWx surfaces variably across
these languages, namely, as -m- in Atayal, but as -um- in Chamorro and Tagalog.
The distributional variation of the inWx is more striking, however. In Atayal,
-m- appears invariably after the Wrst consonant.1 In Chamorro, -um- appears
after the initial onset cluster. In Tagalog, on the other hand, the inWx can appear
either after the initial consonant or after the onset cluster. Many more intriguing
variations in the appearance and distribution of historically related inWxes
exist within typologically and genetically distinct language families. Thus, the
inclusion of samples from closely related languages not only does not confound
the validity of this study, it enriches the database further.
Finally, the use of the terms ‘Wrst’ and ‘last’ deserves some qualiWcation here.
Many earlier studies have invoked these terms. It is perhaps implicitly under-
stood but never explicitly stated what the reference domain is. The notions of
‘Wrst’ and ‘last’ are deWned relative to the root or the stem to which the inWx
attaches, not to its position in a fully formed word. An inWxed stem may acquire
additional adpositional aYxes. The SBM approach to aYxation captures the
cyclic nature of aYxation handily (Inkelas 1998; Inkelas and Zoll 2005; Orgun
1998, 1999; Orgun and Inkelas 2002; Yu 2000). Also, I use ‘Wrst’ and ‘last’
interchangeably with ‘leftmost’ and ‘rightmost’ respectively. The notions of
‘Wrst’ and ‘last’ refer to units that are closest to the left and the right edges of a
stem respectively, although they need not be edge-most. With these disclaimers
inmind,let usbeginourdiscussionwith the Wrst pivotpoint,the Wrstconsonant.
1 As noted in Chapter 2, there is some disagreement on the underlying presentation of this
morpheme in Atayal. Some contend that the morpheme is /@m/ rather than /m/. (See n. 11.)
Pivot Theory and the typology 75
4.3 First consonant
Much research on syllable structure has suggested that the internal complexity
of the syllable onset matters little phonologically. However, in the case of
inWxation, the distinction between the Wrst consonant and the onset cluster is
indispensable, as inWxes may appear to the right of the Wrst consonant. For
instance, in Maricopa, a Hokan language, one method of plural formation is
by adding -uu- after the Wrst consonant, regardless of whether or not the Wrst
consonant is part of a cluster.2
(13) Maricopa
shmank shuumanshIk ‘get up’ (Thomas-Flinders 1981)
shtuutyk shuutuutyk ‘pick’ (Thomas-Flinders 1981)
chmii-m chuumiish-k ‘put’ (Gordon 1986: 96)
kmii-m kuumiish-k ‘bring’ (Gordon 1986: 96)
In Mlabri, a Mon-Khmer language, the nominalizing morpheme -rn- appears
after the Wrst consonant of the stem (14a). When the stem begins with a
consonant cluster, the allomorph -r- is used (14b). When the initial contains
a rhotic, the allomorph -n- is used instead (14c).3
(14) Mlabri nominalization (Rischel 1995: 85)

kap ‘to sing’ krnap ‘singing, song’
peelh ‘to sweep the ground/Xoor’ prneelh ‘a broom’
tEk ‘to hit’ trnEk ‘a hammer’
b. kwEl ‘to be rolled up’ krwEl ‘spiral’
gla? ‘to speak’ grla? ‘speech, words’
pluut ‘to peel’ prluut ‘layer’
klaap ‘to hold’ krlaap ‘forceps of
split bamboo’
gwEEc ‘to poke’ grwEEc ‘Wnger’
c. chrEEt ‘to comb’ chnrEEt ‘a comb’
2 The inWxation of -uu- is only one of many markers of verbal dual/plural stem formation in
Maricopa. Others possibilities include preWxation, suYxation, ablaut, or various combinations of all
these devices. See Gordon (1986: section 2.14) for more discussion.
3 Rischel 1995 mentions a fourth allomorph, -mn-, which, along with -n-, may be used over -rn- or -n-
respectively due to a tendency toward nasal harmony (e.g., bliiŒ ‘raw, unripe’! bnliiŒ ‘green, raw’ not
*brliiŒ). However, Rischel also notes that this generalization is not robust since -mn- and -n- may also
appear withroots thatcontainnonasal(e.g., ˚
$uur ‘todescend’! ˚
$uur ˚
$mnuur‘togodownhill’(1995: 85)).
Moreover,thefunctionofthesenasal‘allomorphs’doesnotalwaysmatchthenominalizingfunctionof-rn-
(according to Rischel, -mn- creates expletive adverbials). This would suggest that -mn- might be best
analyzed as a separate morpheme from -rn- and that the -n- in bnliiŒ is an allomorph of -mn-, not of -rn-.
76 Pivot Theory and the typology
To be sure, many cases of inWxing after the Wrst consonant may be amenable
to alternative analysis. For example, in Classical Arabic, the Measure VIII
template of the verbal derivational morphology, which generally signiWes the
passive or the mediopassive, involves the inWxation of -t- after the Wrst
consonant of the Measure I CVCVC template. However, since Measure
I verb stems do not begin with a consonant cluster, the inWx may be equally
well described as preWxing to the Wrst vowel of the verb stem. Examples in (15)
are taken from Aryan (2001); Measure VIII verbs are cited with the preWx
i which signiWes the third-person singular.
(15) Measure I Measure VIII
katab ‘to write’ ’iktatab ‘he copied’
basim ‘to smile’ ’ibtasim ‘to smile’
kasab ‘to acquire’ ’iktasab ‘to gain’
kashaf ‘to uncover’ ’iktashaf ‘to discover’
garr ‘to mislead someone’ ’igtarr ‘to be blinded’
faraq ‘to separate, part, or
divide a group of
entities’
’iftaraq ‘to split into many parts
or group, to become
divided’
In the cases mentioned thus far, the inWx invariably appears to the right of
theWrstconsonant. Incertain cases, theinWxmightend up‘breakingup’ an onset
cluster. Analytically, I assume that aYxes that subcategorize for the Wrst con-
sonant of some domain have the following subcategorization requirement:
(16) Post-Wrst consonant aYxation
ALIGN (AYx, L, C1-X, R)
‘The left edge of the aYx is aligned to the right edge of the Wrst
consonant of domain X.’
For example, the Mlabri nominalization construction is analyzed as follows:
(17) deverbal-noun-stem
SYNSEM NOUN
PHON 3 ϕ( 1 , 2 /rn/)
SUBCAT ALIGN ( 2 ,L,C1- 3 ,R)
verb-stem
SYNSEM VERB
PHON 1
Pivot Theory and the typology 77
This construction speciWes that the verb may become a noun as a result
of aYxing some exponent of -rn- after the Wrst consonant of the
output verb stem (i.e., C1- 3). Thus, for example, the deverbal noun
krnap ‘singing, song’ in Mlabri is derived from the verb-stem sign of kap
‘to sing’.
(18) deverbal-noun-stem
SYNSEM singing
PHON 2 ϕ(krnap)
SUBCAT ALIGN(/rn/,L,C1- 2 ,R)
verb-stem
SYNSEM to sing
PHON 1 kap
Recall that the declarative nature of signs forbids outputs that fail to satisfy
conditions that are speciWed in each sign. Focusing on the subcategorization
information in particular, any potential outputs that show the exponent of
/rn/ away from the right edge of the Wrst consonant are automatically ruled
out from further consideration. The declarative constraint evaluation can be
illustrated using what I refer to as a Declarative Tableau (D-Tableau). Take, for
example, the D-Tableau in (19). Here, candidate (19b) fails because the
exponent of the nominalizing aYx precedes the Wrst consonant, rather
than following it. Candidate (19a), the attested output, satisWes the subcatego-
rization restriction, but so does candidate (19e), despite the fact that (19e)
does not faithfully realize the nominalizing marker. This is because the
declarative evaluation component is only concerned with the alignment
properties of the candidates, not their phonological composition. Any
candidates that satisfy the subcategorization restriction speciWed by
the deverbal-noun-stem sign are checked, while candidates that do not are
eliminated (indicated by ‘ß’). As such, while failed candidates indicated in the
D-Tableau will not be considered further (e.g., (19b–d)), all candidates that
satisfy the subcategorization requirement (e.g., (19a) and (19e)) must be
subjected to further evaluation by the constraint ranking associated with
the w-function.
78 Pivot Theory and the typology
(19)
ALIGN(rn, L, C1-STEM, R)

e. krap
b. rnkap
c. karnp
d. karp
The declarative component thus serves as a Wrst round of elimination, as
it were. The phonological component is only required to consider
candidates that satisfy the prespeciWed subcategorization restriction.4 The
allomorphy between rn, r, n is in turn determined by the w-function, which
is the phonological grammar of the language.5 This is what I will turn to next.
Mlabri stress being always on the Wnal syllable, and never on the initial,
yields a basic iambic foot structure. The pretonic syllable may contain a full
vowel or a syllabic consonant. Following Rischel’s terminology, the pretonic
syllable that contains a syllabic consonant is referred to as the minor syllable.
A minor syllable may contain one of the following voiced sonorants, /m, n, Æ,
˛, r, l/, optionally preceded by another consonant. Onset consonant clusters
are not allowed in minor syllables; thus the maximum number of consonants
in sequence is three. The constraints in (20) are most relevant for the purpose
of determining the shape of the deverbal nominalizing aYx.
(20) *CCCC Quadri-consonantal sequences are prohibited.
MaxRoot-IO-Seg Do not delete any root segment.
MaxAffix-IO-Seg Do not delete any aYx segment.
*GeminateRhotics Geminate rhotics are prohibited.
*n Assign a violation mark for every instance of /n/.
*r Assign a violation mark for every instance of /r/.
4 Like the Control function proposed in Orgun and Sprouse 1999, the declarative subcategoriza-
tion requirement illustrated above prevents certain candidates from ever surfacing in a language. But
unlike the Control function, which rejects winning outputs predicted by what is equivalent to the
w-function here, the declarative subcategorization requirement here regulates the candidate set that
‘feeds’ the w-function.
5 It should be emphasized that there is no intrinsic temporal relation between the declarative
constraint evaluation and the constraint evaluation involved in the w-function. The only diVerence
between constraints in the w-function and those stated in an Attribute-Value Matrix (AVM) is that
the constraints in the w-function are violable, while the constraints in the AVM are not. I only employ
the separate tableau presentations here to highlight this (non)violability distinction.
Pivot Theory and the typology 79
Outputs with quadri-consonantal sequence are eliminated by the dominating
*CCCC constraint, which penalizes four consonants in a row. This constraint
must dominate MaxAffix-IO-Seg since *CCCC violations are ameliorated
by reducing the number of segments in the aYx. MaxRoot-IO-Seg must
dominate MaxAffix-IO-Seg as well since deletion never aVects the root (see
failure of (21d).6 The choice of which segment in the aYx is to be deleted is
determined by constraints on phonotactics and segmental markedness. Since
/r/ is generally preserved over /n/ in the aYx /rn/, the markedness constraint,
*n, which penalizes all instances of the segment /n/, must dominate *r, which
penalizes all instances of /r/.

The segment /r/ may be deleted over /n/, however, when the preservation of
/r/ would create geminate /r/ (22b).7 This suggests that the *GeminateRhotics
must outrank *n.

6 The relative ranking between MaxRoot-IO-Seg and *CCCC is not clear at this point. Rischel (1995)
reports that quadri-consonantal sequences are possible in lexicalized reduplicated forms (e.g., trŒtuuŒ
‘bamboo ‘‘drum’’’). Thus, if these forms are treated as non-derived, then MaxRoot-IO-Seg must
dominate *CCCC. Since root segments are always faithfully realized on the surface, I shall assume
that MaxRoot-IO-Seg must always be satisWed and will not be considered further in subsequent
tableaux.
7 While Mlabri does not generally allow geminates, Rischel (p. 75) notes that, when a short syllabic
/r/ precedes a labial stop, the labial stop sounds rather like it is geminated (e.g., [rpa:?]  [rp.paa?]).
80 Pivot Theory and the typology
The -rn- allomorph is most faithfully realized when no high-ranking
phonotactic constraints are violated. The aYx may not be reduced to satisfy
the various low-ranking segmental markedness constraints since they are
crucially dominated by MaxAffix-IO-Seg (see the failures of (23b and c)).

Phonologically conditioned allomorphy, like that in Mlabri, is very common
among inWxation patterns. What is crucial is that the allomorphs all conform
to the subcategorization requirement. In the present case, all allomorphs
appear after the Wrst consonant of the verb stem. The phonological grammar
(i.e., the w-function in SBM) only determines the shape of the allomorph,
never its position.
As mentioned earlier, the notion of the pivot point is designed to eliminate
any directional bias in classiWcation. That is, given a said pivot, one expects
the possibility of an inWx appearing before or after the pivot or being
coextensive with it. Certain cases of inWxing reduplication Wt the proWle
of an aYxing-to-the-left-of-the-Wrst-consonant pattern. For examples, in
Pangasinan, a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken in the Philippines,
two patterns of inWxing reduplication are found. One strategy of plural
formation in noun is by preWxing a CV reduplicant to a C-initial stem.
When the stem is vowel-initial, the reduplicant appears after the initial
vowel (24b).

Numerals of limitation are also marked by reduplication. In this case, a CVC
reduplicant is preWxed to C-initial stems (25a), but is lodged after the initial
vowel in vowel-initial stems (25b).

Within the framework laid out in this work, such cases of inWxing only after
an onsetless syllable can be treated as the reduplicant aligning to the left
of the Wrst consonant of the input stem. For example, plural formation via
CV-reduplication can be analyzed as follows:

The subcategorization restriction of the reduplicative plural prohibits
preWxing reduplication (see failures of (27d) and (27e) but favors inWxation
(see (27a) and (27b)) when the input stem is vowel-initial. (The reduplicant
is bold-faced and underlined.) To be sure, peripheral preWxation of the redu-
plicant may also satisfy the subcategorization restriction if the initial vowel is
not faithfully realized on the surface (see (27c)). Such a candidate is ruled out
by the co-phonology of this construction. This is what we shall turn to next.

The size of the reduplicant is assumed to be the consequence of an emergence-
of-the-unmarked ranking pattern. The CV shape of the reduplicant is derived
via the ranking, Realize-Morpheme, Max-IO >> NoCoda, *Struc-m >>
Max-BR. Thus the eVect of a structure-minimizing constraint emerges when
Input-Output faithfulness is not relevant (Kurisu 2001; McCarthy and Prince
1994a; Spaelti 1997; Walker 2000b).
(28) Realize-Morpheme Let a be a morphological form, b be a mor-
phosyntactic category, and F(a) be the phono-
logical form from which F(a þ b) is derived to
express a morphosyntactic category b. Then
RM is satisWed with respect to b iV F(a þ b)
6¼ F(a) phonologically. (Kurisu 2001: 39)
*Struc-m Assigned a violation to each mora present in
the output.
Max-IO An output segment must have an input corres-
pondent.
Max-BR A base segment must have a correspondent in
the reduplicant.
NoCoda Coda consonants are prohibited.
Realize-Morpheme (RM) is a type of faithfulness constraint that requires
every underlying morpheme to receive some phonological exponence (Kurisu
2001). The high ranking of RM guarantees that the plural reduplicant must have
some overt exponent in the output (see the failure of (29d)).8 The dominance of
*Struc-m, a markedness constraint that penalizes the presence of any moraic
structure on the surface, over Max-BR forces the reduplicant to be no larger
than a monomoraic syllable (see the failure of (29c)). To be sure, Max-BR
violations cannot be minimized by reducing the size of the base (see (29e)) since
8 The syllable boundary is indicated by a period.
Pivot Theory and the typology 83
it is more crucial to be faithful to the input than to the base (i.e., Max-IO >>
Max-BR). The reduplicant is always CV in shape due to the dominance of
NoCoda over Max-BR (see (29b)). While the coda consonant in the redupli-
cant is assumed to be weightless in (29b), whether or not codas are moraic in
Pangasinan is inconsequential to the present analysis; a candidate with a moraic
coda in the reduplicant would have incurred a fatal violation of *Struc-m.

Within OT-PR, cases of reduplicant inWxing after an onsetless syllable have
been analyzed as the result of the inWxation of a reduplicative preWx after the
initial vowel in order to avoid duplicating Onset violations. A celebrated
example that has been analyzed under this rubric is Timugon Murut redupli-
cation. Like the cases introduced above, Timugon Murut, an Austronesian
language spoken in Sabah, Malaysia, marks diminutive and frequentative
actions via CV-preWxation when the stem is consonant-initial (30a);
when the stem is vowel-initial, the reduplicant appears after the Wrst
syllable (30b).

84 Pivot Theory and the typology
Previous analysts working within the framework of OT-PR assume the
CV reduplicant to be underlyingly preWxing (McCarthy 2000; McCarthy and
Prince 1993a and 1993b). As illustrated in the tableau below, since straightfor-
ward preWxing reduplication would have introduced two Onset violations in
the output when the stem is vowel-initial (31b), the position of the reduplicant
is minimally adjusted inward in order to minimize Onset violations (31a).

A closer examination of the source data reveals that the Timugon Murut
pattern is more complicated than has been previously assumed. To begin with,
it is not the case that inWxation only takes place when the Wrst syllable is
onsetless. As shown below, inWxing reduplication takes place when the verb
stem is preWxed.9

or ‘T/S is a teacher’

Prentice also points out that inWxing reduplication is not observed in all
vowel-initial roots. Certain vowel-initial roots reduplicate with a prothetic
consonant (Prentice 1971: 121).
(33) Reduplication with prothetic consonant (Prentice 1971: 121–4).

9 Some might question whether the reduplicants are inWxed in these forms at all. Under the
Correspondence Theory of Reduplication, the data can be analyzed as the result of backcopying.
For example, in the case of maninila? ‘T/S teaches frequently’, the Wnal consonant of the preWx maŒ- is
assumed to have syllabiWed as part of the reduplicant, which is then backcopied onto the vowel-initial
root to ensure Base-Reduplicant faithfulness.

Finally, there is evidence to suggest that the distribution of Timugon Murut
reduplication might be stress-governed. Primary stress in Timugon generally
falls on the penultimate syllable.10 Given the fact that the reduplicant tends to
appear in the antepenultimate position in the above examples, the reduplicant
might be analyzed as preWxing to the stressed syllable (or the stressed foot).
Unfortunately, stress is not generally marked in Prentice’s transcriptions, so it
is not possible to ascertain the validity of this analysis at this juncture. If this
stress-based analysis of Timugon Murut reduplication is proven accurate,
however, it will not only obviate the need for an OT-PR analysis of such
inWxing reduplication patterns, but CV reduplication in Timugon Murut
must also be reclassiWed as targeting a prominence pivot.
Like Timugon Murut, pluractional reduplication in SiSwati (34a) and
Kinande (34b), Bantu languages spoken in Swaziland and Zäire respectively,
also show a similar type of post-initial-onsetless-syllable distribution. In these
languages, pluractionality is generally marked by preWxing a bimoraic foot
reduplicant to the verb stem. However, when the verb stem is vowel-initial,
the reduplicant appears inWxing.
(34) a. SiSwati pluractional formation (Downing 1999: 74)

b. Kinande pluractional formation (Downing 1999: 64)
-huma -huma-huma ‘beat’
-ohera o-hera-hera ‘pick for’
-esera e-sera-sera ‘play for’
Despite the surface resemblance, this inWxation pattern is neither a matter of
onsetless-syllable-minimization, as argued by OT-PR advocates, nor a matter
10 There are lexical exceptions to this generalization (e.g., madadá? ‘dislike’ (Prentice 1971)).
86 Pivot Theory and the typology
of aligning with respect to the Wrst consonant of the stem. Downing (1999)
reports that, while inWxing reduplication is observed when the stem begins
with a vowel, it is only so if the stem is underlyingly more than two syllables
long. Data from SiSwati are given below.
(35) InWxing reduplication in 3–5 syllable vowel-initial stems in SiSwati

-eyamı́sa -e-yami-yamı́sa ‘cause to lean’
b. -ehlukánisa -e-hluka-hlukánisa ‘distinguish’
When the stem is disyllabic (36a) or is derived from disyllabic stems (36a), the
reduplicant appears as preWxing even when the stem is vowel-initial.
(36) PreWxing reduplication in disyllabic vowel-initial stems in SiSwati
(Downing 1999: 78)
a. -ókha -okhá-yokha ‘light (a Wre)’
-énya -enyá-yenya ‘soak’
b. -okhéla -okhe-yokhéla ‘light for’
-enyéla -enye-yenyéla ‘soak for’
The data in (36) point to the fact that the reduplicant can appear preWxing
even when the input stem is vowel-initial. A glide is inserted between the Wnal
vowel of the reduplicant and the initial vowel of the base to prevent hiatus.
(36) also shows that the reduplicant is not targeting the Wrst consonant of
the input stem (e.g., -enyéla ‘soak for’ ! -enye-yenyéla / *-e-nyela-nyéla).
Instead, as argued in Downing (1998, 1999, 2000), the reduplicant is preWxing
to a P-Stem (cf. Crowhurst 2004). Following Inkelas’s (1990, 1993) theory of
prosodic misalignment, Downing assumes that the left edge of the reduplicant
must align with the left edge of the P-Stem. P-Stems are generally co-extensive
with the morphological stem. However, the left boundary of the P-Stem in
a vowel-initial stem is misaligned with respect to the left edge of the morph-
ological boundary since the P-Stem must begin with a syllable that begins
with an onset in SiSwati and Kinande (e.g., tfutséla ‘move for’ in SiSwati !
[pstfutséla but etsaméla ‘bask’ ! e[pstsaméla). InWxing reduplication in
cases like (35) is thus analyzed as a consequence of the extraprosodicity of
the stem-initial vowel. The reduplicant is targeting a P-Stem, rather than the
Wrst consonant of the stem, as evidenced by the examples in (36). Downing
argues that the P-Stem is independently motivated by the assignment of the
Pivot Theory and the typology 87
rightmost high tone in stems. In particular, the location of the high tone is
determined by the size of the stem. Two- and three-syllable stems have the
rightmost high tone on the penult (see (35)) while longer stems have
the rightmost high tone on the antepenult (see (37)).
(37) High-tone assignment on > three-syllable stems in SiSwati (Downing
1999: 78)
a. -onákala ‘get spoilt’
-atı́sana ‘introduce each other’
b. -khulumı́sana ‘talk to each other’
-hlanyélela ‘plant for’
Of particular importance is the fact that vowel-initial stems that take inWxing
reduplication have high tone on the penult even in four-syllable stems (see
(35a)). This evidence suggests that the domain for tonal assignment is also
the base of reduplication; the tonal patterns of the inWxing verb stems may be
straightforwardly accounted for if the initial vowel in such stems does not
count toward the stem size calculation.
Whether this PreWx-to-P-Stem analysis can be extended to Timugon Murut
and Pangasinan remains a matter of further research. It is unclear at this point
if there is independent evidence that supports the P-Stem domain in these
languages. As I alluded to earlier, Timugon Murut might turn out to be a case
of preWxing to a stressed pivot. However, the available resources on Timugon
Murut do not oVer enough conclusive evidence in support of this analysis.
In regard to Pangasinan, the mechanism of stress assignment has not been
worked out. Benton notes that there exists minimal pairs in the language that
are distinguished by the location of stress alone (i.e., stress may be on the
penult or the ultima), but he also intimates that stress assignment may
interact with the morphology (Benton 1971: 27–8).
The need to appeal to the P-Stem for analyzing inWxation raises the
question of how the P-Stem Wts into the present typology of inWxation. Recall
that a P-Stem is generally co-extensive with the morphological stem; the
P-Stem is only minimally misaligned with the morphological stem under
restrictive circumstances. Given that the P-Stem is always near the periphery
of some morphological host, it is licensed by the Pivot Theory since the edges
of a P-Stem fall on salient edge positions. It is noteworthy that the present case
of aligning with respect to the P-Stem comes from a set of tonal languages and
that the base of reduplication coincides with the domain of tone assignment.
This suggests that in non-stress-marking languages, the P-Stem might
be equivalent to the stress domain. In connection with this, it is also
interesting to note that the stems that show inWxation in (35) invariably
88 Pivot Theory and the typology
begin with /e/. Downing argues that there is no evidence to suggest that /e/ is
morphologically distinct from the stem synchronically speaking. However,
rather than treating this as a mere coincidence (the interpretation favored by
Downing), it seems likely that the initial /e/ in these inWxing vowel-initial
stems might have been historically a distinct morpheme. InWxation redupli-
cation might have been the result of entrapment (see Chapter 5 for more
discussion on this mechanism) where original preWxing reduplication was
reanalyzed as inWxing when /e/ lost its meaning and became part of the stem.
Further research is needed to ascertain the viability of this analysis, particu-
larly with respect to the morphological status of /e/ in the ancestral language.
No unequivocal cases of a reduplicative inWx appearing to the right of the
Wrst consonant are found. All potential instances of inWxing a reduplicant
after the Wrst consonant can equally well be analyzed as subcategorizing for
the Wrst vowel of the output. For that reason, such ambiguous examples will
be discussed in more detail in the next section.
4.4 First vowel
Another common pivot for inWxation is the Wrst vowel. For example, in
Chamorro, an Austronesian language, the actor focus marker -um- appears
before the Wrst vowel of the root, whether the stem begins with an onsetless
syllable or a consonant cluster.

A similar case is found in Yurok, an Algic language spoken in northwestern
California. The intensive inWx -eg- appears before the Wrst vowel when the
stem is cluster-initial. There are no vowel-initial roots in this language.

Another example of preWxing to the Wrst vowel of the root is found in Toratan
(Ratahan), an Austronesian language spoken in Sulawesi. Here, the past tense
agent voice marker -um- must appear before the Wrst vowel. Crucially, this
pattern cannot be analyzed as inserting to the right of the Wrst consonant, as
could those mentioned in the last section, since the allomorph m- is preWxed
to the Wrst vowel when the stem is vowel-initial.

Following Crowhurst (2004), alignment with respect to the leftmost vowel
is analyzed as alignment with respect to the leftmost mora. For example, recall
that in Leti nominalization has eight allomorphs: three inWxes -ni-, -n-, -i-;
three preWxes ni-, i-, nia; a paraWx i-+-i-; and a zero allomorph. The nomin-
alizer appears inWxing when the root begins with a consonant. Thus, the
allomorph, -ni-, appears before the leftmost vowel of the stem when the stem
has an initial non-nasal or non-alveolar consonant followed by a non-high
vowel (41a). It is realized as -n- when the stem contains a high vowel after the
initial consonant (41b) and as -i- when the initial consonant is a sonorant or
an alveolar consonant (41c). Leti examples cited below are all taken from
Blevins (1999).

n-èmnu ‘to drink’ i-èmnu, ni-èmnu ‘act of drinking, drink,
beverage’
n-òra ‘to be with’ i-òra, ni-òra ‘companion’
As noted in Chapter 2, the fact that the nominalizer is inWxed is puzzling
within a prosodic optimization view of inWxation since inWxation actually
creates initial onset clusters and vowel-vowel sequences11 that could otherwise
be avoided with simple preWxation (e.g., *ni-teti instead of t-ni-eti ‘chop,
chopping’). Leti inWxation cannot be analyzed as the result of edge-avoidance
(e.g., Kaufman 2003) similar to that proposed for Dakota inWxation
(McCarthy and Prince 1993a and 1993b), since the nominalizer may appear
preWxing when the root is vowel-initial (42).
The distribution of the nominalizing markers in Leti Wnds natural expres-
sion in the present theory, however. Following Crowhurst’s (2004) proposal of
mora alignment, I assume that the right edge of the nominalizing marker in
Leti must align with the left edge of the Wrst mora of the input verb stem (i.e.,
mR1), as stated in (43).

As noted in the preceding section, many cases of internal reduplication
after the Wrst consonant can also be classiWed as appearing before the Wrst

adjective intensiWcation are marked by VC(C) reduplicants (46).

gabuji gababuji ‘old person’
yirag yirirag ‘father’

jimgan jimimgan ‘knowledgeable one’
Two interpretations are possible here. The reduplicant could be described as
appearing after the Wrst consonant (47a) or before the Wrst vowel (47b),
as schematized below.

Crowhurst (2004) argues in favor of the preWx-to-the-Wrst-vowel analysis in
(47b). Working within the OT-Phonological Readjustment paradigm, she
assumes that Mangarayi internal reduplication is induced by edge avoidance
92 Pivot Theory and the typology

the inWxation of Red is motivated by the dominance of Leftmost-Rootseg
over Leftmost-Redseg.

The preWxation of the reduplicant to the root and the size of the reduplicant
are derived by ranking Leftmost-Redm, which requires that the leftmost
mora of the reduplicant be lined up with the leftmost mora of some prosodic
word, over Leftmost-Rootm, which requires the leftmost mora of the root be
aligned with the leftmost mora of some PrWd.
(50) a. Leftmost-Redm: Alignm-Left(Red, PrWd)
‘The leftmost mora of Red is aligned with the leftmost mora of
some PrWd.’
b. Leftmost-Rootm: Alignm-Left(Root, PrWd)
‘The leftmost mora of root is aligned with the leftmost mora of
some PrWd.’
BrieXy, as shown in (51), the reduplicant must line up with the leftmost mora;
otherwise, it fatally violates the dominating Leftmost-Redm constraint (51c).
Leftmost-Redm crucially dominates Leftmost-Rootm since it is more
important to align the reduplicant with the leftmost more than to respect
the proper alignment of the root. The reduplicant may copy as much of
the base as possible as long as it does not incur more Leftmost-Rtm violations
than it is necessary. In essence, the size of the reduplicant is restricted to no
larger than a mora (Crowhurst assumes that coda consonants are weightless).

The main intuition captured in Crowhurst’s analysis of Mangarayi reduplication
is the idea that the proper realization of the plural reduplicant, both in terms of
its alignment and in the size of the reduplicant, is determined at the level of
the mora, in addition to the canonical segmental level. While inWxation is forced
by edge avoidance, the size of the reduplicant is derived from the tension
between the prosodic alignment of the reduplicant and the root at the moraic
level. In particular, it is the leftmost mora that is of the utmost importance.
Ontheviewofthepresenttheory,internalreduplicationpatternslikethatfound
in Mangarayi are also analyzed as a matter of moraic alignment. However,
I diVer from Crowhurst in assuming that inWxation falls out from the morpho-
phonological mismatch inherent in the subcategorization restriction speciWed by
thepluralconstruction,ratherthanasamatterofaYxdisplacement.Inparticular,
I assume that the sign for plural formation in Mangarayi speciWes that the
left edge of the reduplicant be aligned with the leftmost mora of the PrWd (52).

Straightforward preWxing reduplication is therefore disallowed because the
left edge of the reduplicant does not coincide with left edge of the leftmost
mora of the output (53).

Internal reduplication obtains when the leftmost segment of the output
does not match up with the leftmost segment subcategorized by the plural
morpheme. That is, when the input verb stem is consonant-initial, the
leftmost segment is an onset, which is not mora-bearing. Since the left
edge of the reduplicant must match up with the left edge of the leftmost
weight-bearing segment, the reduplicant has no choice but to line up with the
nucleus of the Wrst syllable (54).

The present analysis is superior to Crowhurst’s OT-PR analysis for
two reasons. First, it obviates the need to rely on a gradient evaluation of
alignment, in keeping with the declarative nature of alignment required by the
present theory and also with the recent call to eliminate gradiently evaluated
alignment constraints in Optimality Theory (McCarthy 2003b). More prob-
lematic is the fact that Crowhurst’s analysis, indeed the edge-avoidance
approach to edge-oriented inWxation in general, makes an erroneous predi-
ction regarding the behavior of the reduplicant in vowel-initial roots. While
Mangarayi does not contain vowel-initial roots, a similar plural reduplication
construction in Kugu Nganhcara, another Australian aboriginal language,
demonstrates that the edge-avoidance approach is untenable. As shown in
(55b), when the root is vowel-initial, the reduplicant appears preWxing, rather
than after the Wrst segment of the root (i.e., the Wrst vowel in this case) as
predicted by the logic of edge avoidance (the predicted illegitimate outputs
are given to the right of the attested forms in (55b)).

As illustrated in (56), the reduplicant is preWxing when the root is
vowel-initial because the leftmost segment of the reduplicant coincides with
the leftmost mora of the PrWd. The alignment requirement of the reduplicant
is thus satisWed. As predicted by the Phonological Subcategorization
approach, when there is no mismatch in edges, no inWxation is predicted.

The size of the reduplicant is assumed to be the consequence of an emerg-
ence-of-the-unmarked ranking pattern similar to the analysis of Pangasinan
plural reduplication in the last section (also similar in spirit to Crowhurst’s
analysis). In particular, the VC(C) shape of the reduplicant is compelled by
the ranking, Realize-Morpheme, MaxioSeg >> *Struc-m >> Max-BR. As
illustrated in (57), the size of the reduplicant is kept to no more than
one mora due to the dominance of *Struc-m over Max-BR (57b). The
structure-minimizing eVect of *Struc-m is checked by the dominance of
Realize-Morpheme (RM) (57d) and Max-IO (57e). While the reduplicant

12 Kugu Nganhcara reduplication may exhibit the reduction of the labial in root-internal
heterorganic stop+labial sequence (e.g., pukpe ! pukukpe ‘child’; wegbe ! wegegbe ‘keep’). Also, in
heterorganic nasal+labial stop clusters, the labial in the reduplicated cluster is replaced by a stop
homorganic with the nasal (e.g., nunpa ! nuntunpa ‘run’; thanpa ! thantanpa ‘cough’; wunpa !
wuntunpa ‘gather, get’). These additional complications are not relevant to the point made here.

cannot be more than a mora long, it nonetheless may copy as much of the
base at the segmental level as long as it does not increase the mora count (57c).
Like the Australian aboriginal languages, many Salishan languages have a
VC reduplicant; it signiWes what is referred to as ‘Out-of-Control’ in the litera-
ture. Examples from Lushootseed, a Central Salish language, are given in (58).

Working within the Generalized Template Theory of reduplication (McCarthy
and Prince 1994b), which eschews morpheme-speciWc templatic requirements
in favor of generalized morphology-prosody interface constraints specifying
the unmarked prosodic shape of each morpheme category, Urbanczyk (1996)
posits that the Out-of-Control marker belongs to the aYxal category, whose
canonical shape is generally no larger than a syllable. This reduplicative marker
is analyzed as suYxing (i.e., ?al-al ‘hurry up!’). As illustrated by the failure of
(59b), the VC, rather than CVC, shape of the reduplicant follows from the
ranking of NoCoda over BR-Max-Afx, a constraint that demands the full
copying of the base. Despite the dominance of NoCoda over BR-Max-Afx, the
reduplicant nonetheless ends in a coda consonant due to the high-ranking
Anchor-R constraint, which demands that the base and the reduplicant share
a correspondent at the right edge (59c).

When the verb stem ends in a cluster, the reduplicant appears inWxing in

This OT-PR approach to Out-of-Control reduplication runs into two
intriguing problems, however. First, while OT-PR predicts minimal displac-
ement, as shown in (58c) where the stem is polysyllabic, the reduplicant
actually appears further inward in the stem than predicted (i.e., s-ladad@y?
‘woman living alone’ not *s-lad@y@y?). The second problem concerns the
shape of the reduplicant itself. Recall that Urbanczyk assumes no speciWc
templatic requirement of the reduplicant per se. The shape of the reduplicant
is determined partly by a generalized morphology-prosody interface
constraint that speciWes the unmarked prosodic shape of the aYxal category
(i.e., an aYx cannot be larger than a syllable) and partly by constraint inter-
action. As such, it is unclear why the reduplicant does not appear as CV in
polysyllabic stems. For example, why is *s-lalady not possible for ‘woman
living alone’? Urbanczyk resolves the Wrst problem by appealing to the eVect of
BR-Max-Afx, which maximizes the correspondence between the base and the
aYxal reduplicant. Since aYxes in Lushootseed may not exceed the size of a
syllable (see the failure of (61c)), BR-Max-Afx may be maximized by reducing
the size of the base (61b).

To this end, Urbanczyk proposes that candidates like (62b) are suboptimal
because the part of the verb root that corresponds to the base of the redup-
licant does not end in a consonant. The best root structure in Lushootseed
is consonant-Wnal because an overwhelming number of roots are consonant-
Wnal. The constraint, C-Final-Root, requires all output exponents of a root to
be consonant-Wnal. A root interrupted by an inWx, according to Urbanczyk,
has two root components (e.g., s-{lad}Root-ad-{@y?}Root). The root compon-
ent to the left of the inWx must end in a consonant, just as the root component
to the right of the inWx. Candidates like (62b) are less well-formed than the
attested output, since the root component to the left of the OC marker (i.e.,
s{la}Rootla{d@y?}Root) is not consonant-Wnal.
On the view of the present theory, the size and the distribution of the
reduplicant fall out naturally from a preWxing analysis of the reduplicant. The
OC marker is analyzed as preWxing at the moraic level (63). Like the case of
Mangarayi, the OC reduplicant appears after the Wrst consonant of the verb stem
(e.g., ?alal ‘hurry up!’, haa?kw
‘a little while ago’, s-ladad@y? ‘woman living
alone’) because the left edge of the reduplicant must share the same edge with
the Wrst mora of the output Prosodic Word. Hypothetical outputs where the
reduplicant is perfectly aligned with respect to the left edge of the output
(e.g., *s-lalad@y?) or too far to the right of the left edge of the Wrst mora
(e.g., *s-ladad@y?) would therefore be untenable under the present analysis.

The fact that the reduplicant appears as VC falls out from the ranking:

Realize-Morpheme and Max-IO are assumed to be undominated under the
Pivot Theory and the typology 99
present analysis, candidates that violate these constraints will not be consid-
ered in the following tableaux. As illustrated in (64), the dominance of
NoCoda over Max-BR ensures that the reduplicant may only copy up to
one postvocalic consonant; copying any additional postvocalic consonant
would incur extra, thus fatal, violations of NoCoda (64b).

There appear to be exactly two ‘counterexamples’ to the present analysis,
although these examples (66) are also counterexamples to Urbanczyk’s
suYxal analysis. It is noteworthy that both of these ‘counterexamples’ begin
with ?@-, suggesting that they might be better analyzed as preWxed roots. If
such a morphological analysis proves tenable, then these forms would be
accounted for straightforwardly by the present analysis.

13 Coda consonants are assumed to be weightless in Lushootseed. Urbanczyk argues that Lushoot-
seed stress assignment is sonority based.
100 Pivot Theory and the typology
The moraic alignment analysis developed above is superior to Urbanczyk’s
suYxing reduplication analysis both in terms of analytic simplicity and
typological generality. The moraic alignment analysis is less complex since it
does not require the stipulation that roots be consonant-Wnal in Lushootseed
and that such a requirement has to be applicable even to the subpart of a
root. The VC shape of the reduplicant falls out straightforwardly from the
alignment property of the aYx and its interaction with other constraints.
The moraic alignment analysis is also typologically general since the
constraint ranking, Realize-Morpheme, Max-IO >> NoCoda, *Struc-m
>> Max-BR, is common to both the analyses of Mangarayi and Lushootseed,
two typologically and genetically distinct languages. When two analyses
have similar empirical coverage language-internally, the one with greater
cross-linguistic portability (i.e., the moraic alignment analysis) should be
preferred.
Unequivocal cases of inWxing after the Wrst vowel are exceedingly rare. Such
cases are hard to locate because it is not always possible to ascertain whether
the inWx is placed to the right of the Wrst vowel or of the Wrst syllable, as the
right edges of these two phonological pivots often coincide due to the lack of
word-internal codas in the language. Pluractional inWxation in Bole, a Chadic
language spoken in Nigeria, is a case in point. In this language, one of the
several possible indicators of pluractionality is the inWx -gi-. Since the stems
that take this inWx invariably contain an open initial syllable, it is diYcult to
ascertain whether the inWx should be considered appearing after the Wrst
mora or the Wrst syllable.

In Dakota, a Siouan language spoken in the northern area of the United
States and its neighboring regions in Canada, there are more than twenty
inXectional inWxes that appear after the Wrst vowel (Boas and Deloria 1941;
Moravcsik 1977; Shaw 1980). What is interesting about Dakota is that the Wrst
vowel may be followed by a consonant sequence, yet such sequences are parsed
as the onset of the following syllable (Shaw 1980). Consequently, the right edge
of the Wrst vowel is eVectively the right edge of the Wrst syllable as well.

To be sure, unequivocal cases of inWxing to the right of the Wrst vowel
are indeed observed. For example, the durative marker -r- in Budukh, a
Daghestanian language, is one such example. The durative -r-, which has
the allomorph -l-, is found after the Wrst vowel on the surface. As such, the
durative marker always serves as the coda of the Wrst syllable.

In Miskitu, a Misulmalpan language spoken in Nicaragua and Honduras, the
placement of the conjugation markers signiWes a diVerence in the alienability
of nouns. In the alienable nouns, the person markers appear suYxing (76b).
However, when the noun is inalienable, the person markers surface after the
Wrst vowel of the stem, regardless of whether the initial syllable is open or
closed (76a).15

SuYxation of a person marker in inalienable nouns is possible whenever the
inWxation of a person marker creates illicit surface syllable structures. For
example, the second-person marker -m- cannot be inWxed when the Wrst
syllable ends in a consonant (77a) or a glide (77b); when the initial syllable
ends in a palatal glide or contains a high vowel (i.e., /i/ or /u/), the Wrst-person
marker -i- is suYxed (see (77b–d)). (Miskitu vowels include one diphthong
/ie/ and short and long /i, u, a/; syllable boundaries are demarcated by
periods).

c. bi.la ‘mouth’ bi.l-i bi.la-m
d. pu.sa ‘lung’ pu.s-i pu.sa-m
The fact that the suYxal person conjugation is used only when inWxation is
disprefered suggests that the person conjugation in inalienable nouns is
intrinsically inWxal and the peripheral suYxal distribution is secondary.
15 Since stress is always on the Wrst syllable in Miskitu, the person markers in an inalienable noun
may also be characterized as inWxing after the stressed vowel.
16 There is no morphological marking on the noun in the third person. The suYx /ka/ is added
to the root when the noun is inXected (i.e., the construct state). The Wnal /a/ is deleted when followed
by /i/.
104 Pivot Theory and the typology
Following the moraic alignment analysis presented above, an aYx that
appears to the right of the Wrst vowel is analyzed as appearing to the right
of the Wrst mora. Such an analysis thus makes the prediction that coda
consonants in these languages must be moraic (see, e.g., (78a)). Otherwise,
weightless codas would be grouped under the same mora as the Wrst vowel
(see (78b)).
(78) a. σ σ b. σ σ
µ µ µ µ µ
t a k. i *t a k. i

While the moraicity of coda consonants in Miskitu is not known at this point,
the prediction is borne out in the Muskogean case. Lombardi and McCarthy
(1991) observe that CVC and CVV syllables are equivalent under various
phonological and morphological conditions. For example, when the Wrst
vowel is long, the inWxal marker induces closed-syllable shortening (e.g., Choc-
tow aapitta ‘to put into a container’ ! alpitta/*aalpitta; Chickasaw o:ti ‘kindle’
!olti/*oolti).Also,whilethevowelofeveryotherCVsyllableislengtheneddue
to a rule of iambic lengthening, no such vowel lengthening occurs in CVC or
CVV syllables (e.g., /či+pisa+či+li/ ‘thee+see+cause+I’ ! čipiisačiili).
Bunun
A particularly striking example of inWxing with respect to the Wrst vowel
comes from the Isbukun dialect of Bunun, an Austronesian language spoken
in Taiwan. In this language, completed action is indicated by the inserting -i-
or -in- into the verb stem. All Bunun examples below are taken from Lin
(2001). What is peculiar about this case is the distribution of the allomorphs;
the completive marker may appear after the Wrst vowel of the verb (79a) or
before it (79b).

At Wrst glance, the distributions of -i- and -in- appear to be complementary: -i-
surfaces after the Wrst vowel if the Wrst syllable of the root contains an /a/,
otherwise, -in- is inserted before the Wrst mora of the root. To be sure, the aYx
-i- cannot be analyzed as subcategorizing the Wrst syllable since -i- is inserted
after the Wrst vowel whether or not the Wrst vowel is in a closed syllable
(e.g., tal.da.nav ‘to face-wash’ ! ta-i-l.da.nav). Further examination of
the available data suggests that the distribution is much less straightforward,
however. To begin with, some verbs whose Wrst syllable contains the nucleus /a/
take the post-initial-consonant -in- variant rather than -i- (80a). The allo-
morph -in- may also appear after the Wrst nucleus /a/ in verbs that begin with
an /ai/ or /au/ vowel sequence (80b). To be sure, not all verbs that begin with an
/ai/ or /au/ sequence admit -in- in the post-/a/ position (80c).

The data thus suggests that the completive in Isbukun Bunun has two
allomorphs with completely diVerent subcategorization requirements: one
appears after the Wrst mora of the root while the other appears before. I shall
refer to these as the post-mR1 allomorph and pre-mR1 allomorph respectively.
Since the class membership of lexical items that take the post-mR1 versus the
pre-mR1 allomorphs is arbitrary, two inXectional classes in the lexical type
hierarchy are posited: class 1 and class 2. Each verb root belongs to one of these
two classes. The completive form of each verb class is licensed by a diVerent
construction. These two constructions are shown below:

This analysis assumes that the post-mR1 allomorph is underlyingly string-
identical to the pre-mR1 variant. The post-m1 -i- allomorph, a phonologically
conditioned allomorph of -in-, results from the deletion of the nasal to
avoid the creation of an extra coda consonant on the surface (e.g., savai
‘to win’ ! sa-in-vai ! sa-i-vai).
The Isbukun Bunun case illustrates two important points concerning the
analysis of inWxes. First, phonological similarity between inWxal allomorphs is
no guarantee that they are phonologically relatable variants of each other.
Often, multiple subcategorization frames must be assumed for string-identi-
cal allomorphs (see also the analysis of Ulwa construct state aYxation
discussed in Chapter 3). Second, inWxation occurs even when a post hoc
rationale is not readily available.
Pivot Theory and the typology 107
4.5 Final syllable
Toward the right edge of a domain, two pivots can be identiWed: the Wnal
syllable and the Wnal vowel. In this section, I shall Wrst focus on the
Wnal syllable as an inWxal pivot. Consider, for example, the intensive marker
in KiChaga, a Bantu language spoken in Tanzania. The intensive is formed by
inWxing a nasal before the Wnal syllable. The intensifying nasal inWx assimilates
in place to a following velar. In the following examples, the adjectives are
monomorphemic; the verbs end in a Wnal vowel suYx, -a; the last form has a
reciprocal -an- before the Wnal vowel.

b. mu.i.u mui-n-u ‘black’
-aam.bi.a -aambi-n-a ‘look at’
-aam.bi.a.na -aambia-n-na ‘look at each other’
Another clear example of aYxing to the left of the Wnal syllable is found
in two subgroups of the Muskogean languages, Creek-Seminole and
Hitchiti-Mikasuki. The plural aYx, -ho-, appears before the Wnal syllable.
Crucially, the singular stem is monomorphemic.

hi.ca ‘see’ ci-hi:ho:ca-la:ka ‘he will see you all’

Similar to its Muskogean cousins, one strategy for forming verbal pluralization
in Koasati is to inWx -s- before the Wnal syllable. (The forms in (84) are cited
in their third-person indicative form, followed by the switch-reference marker
-n. When the penultimate syllable is light (CV), the vowel is lengthened in the
indicative and is usually marked with a high pitch (acute) accent.)

The punctual reduplicant in Koasati is a -Co- sequence that must appear
before the Wnal syllable of the stem. The consonant of the reduplicant is a copy
of the Wrst consonant of the stem.17 The reduplicant contains a long vowel due
to an independent eVect of penultimate lengthening associated with the
indicative.

A somewhat more complicated pattern of inWxing before the Wnal syllable is
found in Tigre, an Ethiopian Semitic language. Both the intensive -a:- and
the frequentative -Ca:- are inWxed before the Wnal syllable of a regular
verb stem. (Many other Ethiopian Semitic languages show similar intensive/
frequentative morphology. See Rose (2003a, 2003b) for more discussion.)

n@s-a: ‘advise’ n@sa:s@-a: ‘advise a little’
17 Koasati is a pitch-accent language. Since the pitch accent is generally on the penult, the Koasati
examples might also be analyzed as aYxing to some accented unit. However, since the metrical
phonology of this language is not well understood, I shall leave this potential alternative interpretation
for future research.
Pivot Theory and the typology 109
m@zz-a: ‘give responsibility’ m@za:z@z-a: ‘give a little responsibility’
sa¿an-a: ‘load’ sa¿a:¿an-a: ‘load a little’
Rose (2003b) argues that the actual surface form of the frequentative
is governed by several additional requirements, as summarized in (87).
This approach to the Tigre frequentative Wnds natural expression in the
present theory. In addition to the inWx’s subcategorization restriction,
the frequentative construction also imposes additional templatic requirements
(presumably encoded in the associated w-function) on the output. Crucially,
the pre-Wnal syllable distribution of the inWx is never violated on the surface.
(87) Enriched inWxation hypothesis (Rose 2003b: 118–19)
i. Templatic match
An output form with four (Wve) consonants must conform to a
quadric- (quinqui)-consonantal template, matching the position
and nature of the aspectual vowels.
ii. Root realization
All root segments must be represented in the output.
iii. Frequentative realization
Reduplication and the aYx [a:] must be realized in the frequenta-
tive preceding the Wnal syllable of the stem (¼ preceding the
penultimate output root consonant).
It is sometimes diYcult to determine whether certain cases should be clas-
siWed as attaching before the Wnal syllable or after the Wnal vowel. The output
is often indistinguishable. Consider the example from Ineseño Chumash, a
Hokan language. The inWxing reduplication pattern may be described as the
placement of a CV reduplicant before the Wnal syllable (e.g., tašušun ‘to be
fragrant’) or after the Wnal vowel (e.g., tašušun ‘to be fragrant’). The function
of this reduplication pattern is unclear.
(88) Ineseño Chumash (Applegate 1976: 275)
tašušun ‘to be fragrant’
iwawan ‘to cut with a sawing motion’
oxyoyon ‘to be crazy’
yuxwowon ‘to be high, tall’
muc’uc’u? ‘kind of very small bead’ (muc’u? ‘young, small’)
mīxīxīn ‘to be hungry’ (mīxīn ‘to be hungry’)
The classiWcation of patterns such as this remains ambiguous since the
available data do not provide conclusive evidence to argue for one interpret-
ation over the other.
110 Pivot Theory and the typology
4.6 Final vowel
The Wnal vowel as a pivot is most relevant to cases of internal reduplication.
For example, in Kamaiurá, a Tupi language spoken in Brazil, the disyllabic
plural reduplicant appears after the Wnal vowel. When the stem is consonant-
Wnal, the reduplicant appears as inWxing.
(89) Kamaiurá plural reduplication (Everrett and Seki 1985)

omokon omokomokon ‘He swallowed it frequently’
ohuka ohukahuka ‘He kept on laughing’

jeumirik jeumirimirik ‘I tie up repeatedly’
oetun oetuetun ‘He keeps on smelling’
apot apoapot ‘I jump repeatedly’
oekīj oekīekīj ‘He pulls repeatedly’
A similar pattern is found in Korean. Onomatopoetic reduplication involves
inWxing a CV copy of the right edge of the stem after the Wnal vowel.

culuk cululuk ‘dribbling’
allok allolok ‘mottled’

t’a˛ t’ata˛19 ‘bang’
wacak wacacak ‘munching’
A particular interesting type of internal reduplication with reference to
the Wnal vowel is found in many of the Paiwanic languages, part of the
Austronesian family, spoken in Taiwan. For example, in Amis, plurality
is often marked by reduplicating the Wnal C(V)CV of the stem (91a).
When the stem is consonant-Wnal, the reduplicant appears as an inWx (91b).
Curiously, if the penultimate syllable is closed, only the Wnal CCV sequence is
reduplicated (91c).

buqnur ‘anger, hatred’ mia-bugnuqnur ‘to be irritable’
ma-kutnir ‘compact’ mia-kutnitnir ‘to harden’
The proper treatment of this type of reduplication has generated much
controversy in the Formosan linguistic literature due to the unusual shape
of the CCV reduplicant. Chang (1998) assumes that forms like those in (a)
reXect what is referred as ‘full reduplication’ in the Formosan literature while
the data in (b) and (c) are considered instances of the so-called ‘rightward’
reduplication. However, the semantic and functional similarities between
rightward reduplication and full reduplication have prompted some to
question the necessity for making a distinction between the two patterns
(e.g., Lee 2005; Li and Tsuchida 2001).
Here, I submit that the Formosan data above can be understood under a
uniWed analysis within the framework laid out in this work. The analysis mirrors
the analysis of reduplicative inWxes that align with respect to the leftmost mora
introduced earlier. SuYxing to the last vowel is treated as an instance of
20 Vowel clusters are treated as vowel sequences in Amis. The syllabiWcation of niaru ‘village home’
is ni.a.ru, for example.

alignment with respect to the rightmost mora (the analysis proposed here is
similar in spirit to Crowhurst’s (2004) moraic alignment treatment of Kamaiurá
reduplication). A preliminary version of this analysis is stated in (93).

The construction speciWes that the rightmost mora of the plural marker for
both nouns and verbs must align with the rightmost mora of some prosodic
word. As such, any output candidates that show the reduplicant away from
the right edge at the moraic level will be ruled out automatically (e.g., (94b
and d)). (Examples in the tableaux below are all taken from Amis; the
reduplicant is underlined and boldfaced).

The fact that the reduplicant may be either CVCV, CVV, or CCV in shape
renders a uniform prosodic characterization and a templatic analysis of this
pattern untenable.22 Instead, the size of the reduplicant itself is derived
through constraint interaction; no templatic restriction is imposed onto the

prosodic constituent.

plural morpheme itself. Like the analysis of Mangarayi and Lushootseed,
I assume that Realize-Morpheme and Max-IO are high-ranking and cannot
be violated in the output. This guarantees that the segmental content of the
input will always be faithfully realized in the output. Full reduplication is
prohibited by virtue of the fact that the size restrictor constraint, *Struc-Ft,
which penalizes any foot in the output, is ranked above Max-BR. Foot
structure in Formosan languages is generally trochaic, parsed from right to
left at the level of the syllable. Full reduplication, as illustrated in (95), would
have resulted in more feet than partial reduplication.

The fact that the reduplicant never copies the Wnal consonant of the root is
attributed to the dominance of NoCoda over Max-BR. A candidate such as
*kaputkapu is ruled out presumably due to a high-ranking AnchorBR-R,
which requires the right edges of the base and the reduplicant to correspond.

Here, I propose that candidates with a reduplicant smaller than two moras

reduplication, stated below:
114 Pivot Theory and the typology
(98) Red-PrWdHead
The leftmost segment of a reduplicant is dominated by the head of a
prosodic word.
Red-PrWdHead states that the leftmost segment of a reduplicant is dominated
by the head of a prosodic word.23 Since a minimal prosodic word cannot be
smaller than a foot, as required by the prosodic hierarchy, and since a foot
must be trochaic and disyllabic in these languages, the reduplicant must be
disyllabic. As shown in (99), monosyllabic reduplication is eliminated by the
declarative component. To be sure, (99c) fails not because the declarative
component imposes size restrictions on the reduplicant per se. Candidates
with a reduplicant smaller than two moras simply have no way of satisfying
the two subcategorization requirements of the plural construction simult-
aneously; (99d) shows that when the monomoraic reduplicant is part of the
head, thus satisfying Red-PrWdHead, it will nonetheless violate the other
alignment restriction, alignm-Right(Red, PrWd).

23 The current analysis is similar in spirit to Crowhurst’s analysis for Kamaiurá where the bisyllabic
size of the reduplicant is captured by the RED-augment alignment constraint, RED-PrWd-Leftm,
which states that the leftmost segment in every RED is the leftmost segment of a PrWd.

more *Struc-Ft violations than the attested candidate. Candidates with
monomoraic reduplication (e.g., pam

) are undesirable since they
will always violate the Red-PrWdHead requirement. The optimal candidate
(101a) satisWes Red-PrWdHead, since Red-PrWdHead only requires that the
leftmost segment be dominated by the head of a prosodic word. Thus,
the leftmost segment of the reduplicant need only be part of, rather than
coextensive with, a head syllable (the diagram in (102) illustrates this point).

116 Pivot Theory and the typology
As illustrated above, moraic alignment oVers just the tool needed to provide a
uniform analysis of the C(V)CVreduplication pattern. The plural reduplicant
is atemplatic; the size variation of the reduplicant is a consequence of the
interactions between constraints on the subcategorization restriction of
the plural marker and constraints on phonotactic and general markedness.
Now, let us turn to inWxation before the Wnal vowel. While such inWxes are
rare, they are nonetheless observed. For example, as mentioned in Chapter 2
(Section 2.1), the applicative -il- in ChiBemba (and other Bantu languages)
appears before the last vowel of a causativized stem (e.g., -leef-es-i̧- ‘to lengthen
for/at’ from -leef-i̧- ‘to lengthen’). Likewise, in Levantine Arabic, a copy of
the initial consonant appears before the Wnal vowel to signify intensiWcation.

Cowell 1964)
barad barbad ‘shaved unevenly’
šara šarša ‘criticized severely’
alat alat ‘sheared unevenly’
daal dadal ‘rolled gradually’
In Zuni, a copy of the stem-initial consonant appears before the Wnal syllable,
marking medio-passive and repetitive.

tomo ‘to strike the skin drum’
čuwapi tomto+k’+e+?a ‘who is making noises on the skin drum
(-k’¼CAUS, -e ¼ CONT)
As already mentioned earlier, cases of Wxed-segment inWxation after the Wnal
vowel are rare and are often ambiguous. For example, in Huave, a Huavean
language spoken in Mexico, the indeWnite actor morpheme can be treated as
either appearing after the Wrst vowel or after the Wnal vowel of the root since
the size of the roots is monosyllabic (see (71) - (73) for other examples of such
ambiguous cases).

Pivot Theory and the typology 117
Examples of this indeWnite actor inWxing construction in Huave are
scarce since the more common indeWnite actor marker is the suYxal
allomorph -aran.
4.7 Stress and related metrical units
Units of stress often serve as pivot points for inWxes. InWxes may target the
stressed foot, the stressed syllable, or, in some cases, even the stressed vowel.
Logically, there are six possible edges an inWx can target: the left edges of a
stressed foot, a stressed syllable, or a stressed vowel, and the right edges
of those respective units. However, clear examples that can substantiate this
six-way typology are hard to locate. This is because it is not often clear what
edge an inWx subcategorizes for, as the stressed pivots are in a hierarchical
relationship with one another and thus the edges of the diVerent stressed
pivots often coincide. For example, when the stressed foot is trochaic, the left
edge of the stressed foot is also the left edge of the stressed syllable. Likewise,
when the stressed foot is iambic, the right edge of the stressed foot is the right
edge of the stressed syllable. InWxes that target such edges are therefore
amenable to either a stressed-foot or a stressed-syllable pivot analysis.
For example, in Samoan, a Polynesian language, the plural is marked by
reduplicating the penultimate, thus stressed, syllable. Syllables are always
open, and so the reduplicant is CV in shape. When the stem is more than
two syllables long, the reduplicant appears to inWx before the stressed syllable.
(In the following examples, stress is marked to facilitate the presentation, even
though it is not marked in the source.)
(107) Samoan plural (Mosel and Hovdhaugen 1992: 221–2)
’toa ‘brave’ to’toa
’ma: ‘ashamed’ ma’ma:

a:’vaga ‘elope’ a:va’vaga
ata’mai ‘clever’ atama’mai
ma?a’lili ‘cold, feel cold’ ma?ali’lili
to’?ulu ‘fall, drop’ to?u’?ulu
It is not immediately obvious whether the pivot should be construed in
terms of the stressed foot or the stressed syllable. Either characterization
would seem to be adequate in accounting for the pattern in Samoan.
A similarly ambiguous case is found in Ulwa. As already mentioned in several
occasions in the earlier chapters, the inWxal variant of the construct-state
118 Pivot Theory and the typology
markers in Ulwa must surface after the leftmost iambic foot of the stem.
An SBM analysis of this pattern using the stressed foot as the pivot was
developed in Chapter 3. It is equally plausible to analyze the pivot as the
stressed syllable, however, since the right edge of an iambic foot coincides
with the right edge of the stressed syllable.

(?)ábu, abú: abú:-ma ‘stingray-CNS2’
To be sure, it is possible to tease apart the foot-based analysis from the
syllable-based analysis. For example, Ulwa has a distributive reduplication
pattern where the CV reduplicant copies the head syllable of an iambic foot
(109a). When the root is larger than a syllable, the reduplicant appears inWxed
(109b) since the left edge of the stressed foot and the left edge of the stressed
syllable do not coincide. As such, the reduplicant is analyzed here as targeting
a stressed-syllable pivot, rather than a stressed-foot pivot.

Another prime example that illustrates the disassociation between the stressed
foot and the stressed syllable is observed in the case of English expletive
inWxation. Recall that, in general, the expletive must appear to the left of a
trochaic foot. However, based on data like those in (110), the expletive may
equally well be analyzed as targeting the stress-syllable pivot.

As it turns out, words in (110b) may have alternative inWxal patterns.
Crucially, the expletive may appear before or after the third syllable of an
initial dactylic sequence. This distribution suggests that the expletive is not
targeting the left edge of the stressed syllable per se. Rather, the distribution
of the expletive is foot-based. Depending on how the initial dactyl is analyzed,
the expletive in English has been analyzed as targeting the left edge of a
stressed foot (Davis 2005) or as lodging at the boundary of two feet
(McCarthy 1982).

It should be noted that, since the expletive may appear to the left of a
foot boundary, words like Popocatepetl or anticipatory have two possible
expletive-inWxed variants. This is because there are two feet with left edges
internal to the word (the inWxal locations are indicated by the downward
arrow, #).

Before turning to examples of inWxes that target the stressed vowel, it is worth
mentioning that, like the edge pivots, same-edge alignment is also possible with
respect to a prominence pivot. Plural reduplication in Washo is a case in point.
Washo is a language spoken in an area in California and Nevada around
Lake Tahoe. In this language, partial internal reduplication denotes plurality
in nouns and pluractionality in the verbal domains.

At Wrst glance, this plural formation pattern appears to be a straightforward
instance of root-Wnal syllable reduplication with Wnal-consonant extram-
etricality. That is, /p’isésew/ ‘ear’ can be parsed as /p’isé-se-w/. However,
when a root contains an internal consonant sequence, the reduplicant is
lodged before the sequence, thus obfuscating the straightforward pre-Wnal
syllable analysis.

The placement of the reduplicant has also been a subject of much debate. Some
argue that the reduplicant appears before the stressed vowel (Jacobsen 1964;
Winter 1970), while others contend that the reduplicant appears after the Wrst
consonant (Broselow and McCarthy 1983/84) or after the Wrst CV (Urbanczyk
1993) of the root. In Yu 2005a, I demonstrate that the placement and the size of
the plural reduplicant depend crucially on the interaction between constraints
on aYx anchoring, stress, and weight assignments. The reduplicant must be
analyzed as anchoring with respect to the left edge of the stressed syllable. The
reduplicant always appears in the penultimate syllable because main stress must
be on the penult in polysyllabic words in Washo. The fact that the reduplicant
appears before the word-internal consonant sequence in (114) follows from
the fact that stressed syllables must be heavy in the language (Yu 2005a,
2006). Thus, short of geminating the post-tonic intervocalic consonant
(e.g., *?ewšı́š:i? ‘father’s brother’), Washo satisWes the stress-to-weight require-
ment by lodging the reduplicant where the Wrst consonant of the internal
consonant sequence can function as the coda of the stressed syllable.
InWxes that illustrate the stressed-vowel pivot are exceedingly rare. Many
of the Northern Interior Salish languages mark the diminutive by inWxing
Pivot Theory and the typology 121
a reduplicative copy of the pre-tonic consonant after the stressed vowel,
regardless of whether the stressed syllable is open or closed. Some examples
from Shuswap are given in (115).

Chamorro continuative CVreduplication is potentially an instance of inWxing
after the stressed vowel. The traditional analysis of Chamorro reduplication
(e.g., Broselow and McCarthy 1983/84; see also de Lacy’s (1996) analysis of
Maori reduplication) assumes that the reduplicant appears before the Wnal
disyllabic foot (e.g., hu(gando) ! huga(gando)). Unlike Samoan, however,
the Wnal foot of the continuative in Chamorro does not coincide with the
stressed foot, as the main stress is on the antepenult.24 Consequently, previous
analyses rely on the notion of a Wnal disyllabic prosodic stem, deWned
speciWcally for the purpose of reduplication only. The post-stressed-vowel
analysis of the continuative reduplicant avoids the need to appeal to the
notion of a prosodic stem completely.

The clearest example of inWxing after the stressed vowel comes from a case
of Wxed-segment inWxation sound in Upriver Halkomelem, a Coast Salish
language spoken in British Columbia, Canada. Plurality in this language may
be marked by either CVC-reduplication (117a) or -l- inWxation (117b). In a few
cases, plurality is indicated by ablaut (117c). Of particular interest here is the
fact that the -l- inWx, which may appear as -l- or -le-, must appear after
the stressed vowel of the root.
24 Note that the unreduplicated form has penultimate stress (e.g., hu’gando ‘play’ vs hu’gagando
‘playing’). Non-lexical antepenultimate stress appears to be speciWc to continuative reduplication
patterns only since Wxed aYxes cause stress-shift to the default penultimate position (e.g., nána
‘mother’ vs naná-hu ‘my mother’).

In Nakanai, an Austronesian language spoken in New Britain, nominalization
is formed by inserting -il- before the stressed vowel in words containing
exactly two syllables (118a). In longer words, nominalization is formed by
suYxing -la instead (118b).

On the present theory, the distribution of -il- and -la can be handled easily as a
matter of diVerences in subcategorization restrictions. The inWxal allomorph
has the following subcategorization requirements: (i) -il- right-subcategorizes
for the stressed mora of the stressed foot (i.e., m0
), and (ii) the left edge of
-il- must coincide with the left edge of the leftmost mora of the Prosodic
Word (see McCarthy 2003 for similar alignment requirements).

If the subcategorization restrictions of -il- cannot be satisWed simultaneously,
the suYxal allomorph, -la, is used. The fact that the suYxal allomorph is
never used with disyllabic roots suggests that -la is the ‘elsewhere’ allomorph
that the grammar defaults to when the inWxal -il- is not possible. Following
Bonet, Lloret, and Mascaró (2003), I assume that aYx alternants are extrin-
sically prioritized (see also McCarthy and Wolf 2005; Paster 2006). The
subcategorization requirement of -il- is thus assumed to take precedence
over that of the suYxing -la.

Anasymmetry isimmediately apparent giventhe set of edgepivots. Allelsebeing
equal, one might expect the Wrst syllable and the Wnal consonant to be among
the set of edge pivots given the need for the Wnal syllable and the Wrst consonant
as pivot points. In fact, both Ultan and Moravcsik admit inWxes before the
Wnal consonant and after the Wrst syllable. However, convincing patterns of
inWxation illustrating the need for those pivot points are not very forthcoming.
I review potential evidence for these two pivot points in this section.
4.8.1 Final consonant
I begin by Wrst considering cases that might exemplify the Wnal consonant
pivot. Note that aYxation to the right of a Wnal consonant is not discussed
here since it is trivially satisWed by cases of regular suYxation.25
25 To be sure, inWxation may obtain when an aYx subcategorizes for the right edge of the Wnal
consonant of stems that are invariably vowel-Wnal (e.g., a root CVCV is CVCAV when aYxed with A).
I have not been able to locate such a case, however.

4.8.1.1 Takelma frequentative reduplication Takelma, a Penutian language
formerly spoken in southwest Oregon, has several strategies for forming
frequentatives. The more general method is to mark the frequentative via
suYxing C1C2-reduplication, where C1 and C2 are copies of the Wrst and
second consonants of the verb stem, respectively (121).

Of particular interest here is the frequentative formation strategy found in a
restricted set of verbs in the language. As shown in (122), this type of
frequentative appears to be a case of VC reduplicant lodging before the Wnal
consonant of the verb stem (e.g., hem-em-g). Broselow and McCarthy (1983/
84), for example, analyze the reduplicant as surfacing in the [C0V (C)]
environment in the stem. Yet, in light of the reanalysis of Lushootseed
presented above, the VC reduplicant may also be analyzed as lodging after
the initial consonant (e.g., h-em-emg). This analytic ambiguity is artiWcial,
however. Upon closer examination, a diVerent analysis emerges once the
morphology of the language is taken into account.

Frequentative formation in (122) is best analyzed as a case of C-reduplication
inWxing after the root-Wnal vowel. In order to appreciate this analysis, a brief
overview of the verbal morphology is in order. The following exposition
draws heavily on Lee’s (1991) reanalysis of Takelma phonology and morph-
ology based on Sapir’s materials.
Takelma verbal morphology is templatic, similar to those found in Semitic
languages and various Native American languages (e.g., Yawelmani and the
Miwok-Costanoan languages). There are two types of verb stem. Following
Lee’s terminology, the base for future, inferential, imperative, conditional,
and potential aYxation is referred to as the ‘aorist stem’, while the base for all
other tense and mode forms is referred to as the ‘non-aorist stem’. Depending
on the tense-mode, the prosodic shape of the verb may vary. Consider, for
example, the non-aorist CVC stems in (123). Certain non-aorist stems have
corresponding CVVC aorist stems (123b) while others have CVCV (123b).
(123) Non-aorist Aorist (B. Lee 1991: 90)

Furthermore, there are several patterns of non-aorist/aorist correspondence
for verbal stems, as summarized in (124). It is unclear at this point why certain
verbs follow one mapping pattern and others do not.

126 Pivot Theory and the typology
CVVC CVCV

CVCiVCi
What is of importance here is the fact that the frequentative forms in (122) are
based on the CVCV(C) aorist stems, rather than the CVC(C) non-aorist
counterparts, as assumed in Broselow and McCarthy’s analysis.29 Lee analyzes
the frequentative as the result of the mapping of an uneven iambic templatic
(i.e., smsmm) onto a verbal root with the simultaneous spreading of the
second consonantal melody to the Wnal consonant of a CVCVVC surface
form (Lee, 1991: 137). This templatic analysis suVers from two inadequacies,
however. To begin with, it is unclear what the status of the CVCVVC template
is with respect to the smsmm template. Given that the bimoraicity of the head
of the iambic template can be satisWed by the long vowel, it is unclear why the
extra Wnal consonant is needed. Moreover, Lee’s analysis crucially assumes
that the Wnal consonant of all CVCC roots can be reanalyzed as CVC+C. That
is, while the infrequentative forms in (122) invariably end in two consonants,
Lee assumes that the Wnal consonant in such clusters is analyzed as a petriWed
suYx. The CVCC roots in (122) are thus assumed to be CVC roots in disguise.
This assumption is crucial to Lee’s templatic analysis since the Wnal consonant
of the CVCVVC template would otherwise have been Wlled by the third
consonant of consonantal melody (i.e., hem-k ‘take out’ ! hemeem-k, not
*hemeek). This assumption is untenable, however. While some of the forms
that participate in this frequentative pattern end with a demonstrable pet-
riWed suYx (125a), others may not (125b).30 Contrary to the prediction of the
templatic analysis, the reduplicative consonant appears after the Wnal vowel
regardless of whether or not the Wnal cluster ends in a petriWed suYx (125b).

hem-k heme-k hemeem-k ‘take out’
kin-k kini-k kiniin-k ‘go to’
29 According to Sapir, the CaC-frequentative formation in (121) takes non-aorist stems as inputs.
30 Lee analyzes all forms in (125) as ending with a petriWed suYx. However, I Wnd no support for
such an analysis for the forms in (125b) based on Sapir’s description (Sapir 1922: 118–43).

In sum, Takelma frequentative formation is the result of aYxation of a
monoconsonantal reduplicant to the right of the Wnal vowel of a verb root
that is then mapped onto an uneven iambic template. If roots with a petriWed
suYx are treated as polymorphemic, then Takelma inWxing frequentative
formation is best analyzed as an instance of aYxing to the right of the
stem-Wnal vowel, rather than before the stem-Wnal consonant.
4.8.1.2 Hunzib Another potential example of inWxing before the last
consonant is found in Hunzib, an East Tsezic language of the Daghestanian
sub-branch of Nakh-Daghestanian. According to van den Berg (1995), there are
two patterns of inWxation before the last consonant of the stem in this language.
Interrogation in Wnite verb forms is marked by a suYx, -y, after V, andi, after C
or by an inWx, -y-, which is inserted before the last C of the stem (van den Berg
1995: 113). Verb forms with an interrogative inWx may have a negative nuance,
indicating that the action mentioned by the verb should not have been done or
conversely should have been done but has not (e.g., čáx ‘to write’; čáyx-is ‘did X
(really) not write? (X should already have written)’; čáyx-er? ‘did X (really)
write? (Why did X, X should not have)’).31 Based on van den Berg’s examples,
the distribution of -y- is amendable to multiple analyses (e.g., the pivot might be
the stressed vowel, the Wnal vowel, the initial vowel, or the Wnal consonant).
Hunzib also has a set of inWxing plural markers which exhibit a pre-last-
consonant distribution, regardless of whether the last consonant appears
word-Wnally or before a Wnal vowel. For example, as illustrated in (126), -baa-
invariably appears before the last consonant of the root regardless of whether the
root ends in a C (i.e., (126a)) or a CV sequence (i.e., (126b)). This pre-last
consonant distribution is observed even in derived stems, regardless of whether
the derivational morphology is synchronically productive (126c) or not (126d).32
(126) a. -ũčaax -ũčabaax33 ‘slumber’
ãgaš ãgabaaš ‘talk’
tadaax tadabaax ‘get tired’
31 Van den Berg cites only one example of such inWxed questions.
32 Van den Berg diVerentiates productive and unproductive derivational aYxes by ‘-’ and ‘.’
respectively.

While the examples in (126) represent the exhaustive list of verbs that take the

allomorphs (van den Berg 1995: 81–3): the inWx is -y- when the vowel before
the last consonant is i or e (127a), -w- when the pre-last consonant vowel is ī,
@, o, or u (127b), -- when preceded by a, and -á- when preceded by a (127b).
The plural marker is always stressed on the surface.

-á- is consistently inserted in front of the last consonant. The only exception is the

While the plural -- is invariably stressed on the surface, the distribution of
the marker itself cannot be derived from stress placement alone. Stress
generally falls on the penultimate syllable. However, when the plural marker
appears in the Wnal syllable, the Wnal syllable, rather than penultimate syllable,
is stressed instead. To the extent that stress is prespeciWed to be on the inWx,
thus genuinely unpredictable in the plural forms, Hunzib oVers a strong case
for the last consonant pivot.
4.8.1.3 Hausa Class 5 plural formation Another promising inWxal pattern
that argues for the Wnal consonant as a phonological pivot comes from Hausa,
a Chadic language spoken in Niger, Nigeria, and neighboring countries. Class
5 plurals in this language are formed by inWxing the vocalic plural morpheme
-aa- before the Wnal consonant of the root followed by the suYxing of the
Wnal vowel -uu (130) (Newman 2000: 443–4). Thus when the root ends in a
consonant cluster, the plural morpheme-aa- is straightforwardly inWxed
before the root-Wnal consonant.

giy‚ gii‚ı̀i giyàa‚uu ‘tooth gap’
miyk miikı̀i miyàakuu ‘ulcer’
The problem with claiming that the plural marker is inWxed before the Wnal
consonant is that such an analysis cannot be straightforwardly extended to
roots without Wnal consonant clusters. That is, when the root ends in a single
consonant, the Wnal consonant is duplicated.

130 Pivot Theory and the typology
Thus, whether Hausa Class 5 plural formation should be treated as a case of
inWxation is a matter of debate. Some scholars have treated Hausa plural
formation as a matter of prosodic template satisfaction (Rosenthal 1999), akin
to the broken plural in Arabic (McCarthy and Prince 1990). The problem
posed by the CVC roots in (131) for the pre-Wnal-consonant analysis is
reconcilable within the current theory, however. Class 5 plural formation
can be analyzed as follows:

The two exponents of the Class 5 plural formation have diVerent alignment
requirements. Both exponents take the Wnal consonant as the pivot. One
exponent, -aa-, appearsto theleftofthe lastconsonantwhiletheotherexponent,
-uu-, aligns to the right of the last consonant of the root. When a root is cluster-
Wnal, -aa- fulWlls its alignment obligation by breaking apart the root-Wnal
consonant sequence. When the root ends in a single consonant, however, the
root-Wnal consonant must undergo compensatory reduplication to prevent
hiatus (i.e., ga‚ ‘joint, limb’ ! ga‚àa‚uu, not *gaàa‚uu). Compensatory
reduplication (CR) refers to a type of reduplication pattern which takes place
with no obvious semantic import or serves only a secondary role in a morpho-
logical construction (Bissell 2002; Goad2001; Inkelas2005; Inkelasand Zoll 2005;
Kawu 2000; Nelson 2003; Rose 1997; Yu 2004d, 2005b; Zuraw 2002). It is invoked
only tocompensatefor potential inadequaciesof the output. In the caseofHausa
Class 5 plural formation, CR is needed to prevent the emergence of onsetless
syllables on the surface. Formally, compensatory reduplication in Hausa is
modeled as the result of some CR-triggering constraint outranking the relevant
Faith constraints (e.g., Integrity). Default segmental insertion is blocked in
favor of CR when DEPIO outranks Integrity (see the failure of (134c)).
(133) Integrity-IO No element of the input has multiple correspondents
in the output. (McCarthy and Prince 1995)

Since the traditional B(ase)-R(eduplicant)-Anchor analysis does not apply
here due to the lack of an abstract morpheme, RED, in the input, a surface
correspondence method of evaluating the relationship between the ‘redupli-
cant’ and the ‘base’ (cf. Bat-El 2002; Yip 1999; Yu 2003, 2004, 2005b; Zuraw
2002) is adopted here. The idea behind this approach is that output-identical
segments stand in a correspondence relationship (Hansson 2001; Rose and
Walker2004).Following Rose andWalker (2004)andHansson (2001),Iassume
that directionality is stated in a correspondence relationship.35

‘Let SR be a segment in the output and SL be any corresponding
segment of SR such that SL precedes SR in the sequence of segments
in the output (L > R).’
The constraint in (135) requires the ‘base’ of reduplication to follow the
reduplicant, not the other way around. An illustration of this analysis is
given in (136).

previously for the input-output relationship (i.e., Ident-IO vs Ident-OI; (Morén 2000, 2001; Pater
1999)) and in other applications of surface segmental correspondence, for example, in consonant
harmony (Hansson 2001; Rose and Walker 2004).
36 This constraint is a generalized version of the Ident-CC(F) constraint proposed in Rose and
Walker (2004).
132 Pivot Theory and the typology
copy follows the base. Given this analysis, Hausa Class 5 plural formation may
be considered additional evidence for the last-consonant pivot. Notwith-
standing the data from Hunzib and Hausa, the evidence for the last-
consonant pivot remains scant, however. Further investigation is obviously
needed to substantiate the need for a Wnal consonant pivot. From a diachronic
perspective, it is not surprising why such cases are hard to come by. Languages
often have restrictions on codas. In particular, coda clusters are often
disfavored or banned altogether. Thus the contexts in which a Wnal consonant
pivot can be unequivocally established are diYcult to obtain.
4.8.2 First syllable
Another phonological pivot hinted at in Ultan and Moravcsik but not
appealed to here is the Wrst syllable. Such a pivot should be logically possible,
particularly given the need of a Wnal-syllable pivot. As mentioned earlier,
evidence for aYxing after the Wrst syllable is hard to come by, partly because
many potential cases may also exemplify the Wrst-vowel pivot. Moreover,
I cannot appeal to cases of aYxing before the Wrst syllable as diagnostic
evidence since such cases can also be trivially analyzed as straightforward
preWxation.
Despite the abovementioned diYculties, there is some suggestive evidence
for the Wrst-syllable pivot. For example, in Koasati, a Muskogean language,
one method of marking punctual plural is by lodging -ho- after the initial
syllable of the stem. The data reproduced in (137) are all that were cited in
Kimball 1991.
(137) Koasati punctual plural (Kimball 1991: 326)
ok.cay.yan ‘to be alive’ okhocayyan
ok.cák.kon ‘to be blue’ okhocákkon
ak.æát.lin ‘to be oversize’ akhoæátlin
stok.hát.kan ‘to be gray’ stokhohátkan
How compelling this pattern is as evidence for the Wrst-syllable pivot is
confounded by several peculiarities of this data set. The general method of
marking the punctual plural in Koasati is inWxing reduplication (see (85)
above). The -ho- inWx is used only when the initial syllable of the stem is
closed. The range of coda consonants is vast in Koasati, and no special
restriction on the coda inventory of the initial syllable is reported. Thus, the
fact that stems that take the -ho- inWx all begin with a syllable that ends in k
raises suspicion that the initial syllable might be a separate morpheme or that
k might be part of the inWx itself. The available published account of this
Pivot Theory and the typology 133
pattern oVers no further information than what is recounted here. Thus,
further research is needed to ascertain the nature of the -ho- aYx in Koasati.
The most promising set of evidence in support of the initial syllable as a
phonological pivot comes from a surprising set of languages. In Mandarin, for
example, the syllable -li- may be inWxed after the Wrst syllable in a mono-
morphemic disyllabic root (e.g., hwudu-de ‘muddled’ ! hwu-li-hwudu-
de ‘good and muddled’; (Chao 1968)). The Mandarin data are problematic
since the -li- inWxation construction is rather restricted in Mandarin. It is
possible that the ‘inWxed’ forms are lexicalized phrases, rather than the
products of genuine inWxation.
A more robust pattern of inWxation is found in Cantonese, however. The
word, kwai ‘ghost’, for example, may appear inside certain monomorphemic
disyllabic adjectives to signify intensiWcation.
(138) Cantonese (Matthews and Yip 1994: 43)
lœntsœn ‘clumsy’ lœn-kw·i-tsœn ‘downright clumsy’
jUksyn ‘ugly’ jUk-kw·i-syn ‘downright ugly’
Another productive pattern of inWxation in Cantonese is observed with
certain wh-words. For example, m·tkw·i or m« ‘what’ may appear
inside a word to signify uncertainties the speaker might have about a word or
a proposition (139). The post-initial syllable distribution of this inWx is
conWrmed by the examples in (139b). Here, the inWx is applied to loanwords,
which arguably have no internal morphological structure. Crucially, the inWx
may only occur after the Wrst syllable of the loanword, never after the
penultimate syllable. To be sure, the wh-inWx may not appear internal to a
syllable either. That is, jU-m·t§.kw·i-k.syn is not a possible output of the
word ‘ugly’ in Cantonese.

134 Pivot Theory and the typology
The exact distribution of this inWx is complicated by the fact that it might also
interact with foot structure. Some quadrisyllabic words show variation in the
distribution of the inWx; the inWx may appear after the Wrst syllable or after the
Wrst disyllabic string (139c). One interpretation of this variation is that
the inWx wants to be after the Wrst prosodic constituent of a string. Assuming
that quadrisyllabic words are analyzed as consisting of two disyllabic feet, the
wh-word may appear after the Wrst foot or the Wrst syllable. Thus, while it is
diYcult to substantiate the need for a Wrst-syllable pivot on the strength of
one set of evidence, the Cantonese evidence nonetheless provides a strong
case for such a pivot. Future research might turn up more supporting
evidence for this pivot.
4.9 Conclusion
This chapter elaborates the theory that phonological subcategorization may
target only a restricted set of phonological pivots. Members of the set of
phonological pivots share the characteristic of being psycholinguistically
salient. Subcategorizations involving this set of phonological pivots are
more reliable than subcategorizations involving other conceivable pivot
points. Edge pivots dominate the set of salient phonological pivots because
they are psycholinguistically salient and are conducive to resulting in more
reliable subcategorization restrictions. To exemplify the Pivot Theory, I review
numerous cases of inWxation instantiating the type of pivots predicted by the
theory and how such cases may be analyzed within a declarative theory of
the morphology-phonology interface.
A full understanding of the Edge-Bias EVect is not yet complete, however.
In addition to a theory of phonological subcategorization and a theory of
inductive bias in phonological subcategorization formation, it is equally
important to understand the contexts in which the inductive bias is called
into play. The next chapter deals with this Wnal dimension of a holistic theory
of inWx distribution—the mechanisms of inWx genesis.

The secret history of inWxes
In Chapter 3, I argued that a full understanding of the distribution of inWxes
requires a theory of phonological subcategorization and its interaction with
grammar-external constraints or Wlters. Two types of Wlters are most relevant
in the present context: inductive biases in morphological learning and
constraints on language change. In the last chapter, I introduced a type of
inductive bias that constrains the types of phonological subcategorization rela-
tions a learner might set up. The force of this inductive bias is most apparent,
however, when the learner is confronted with a situation where straightforward
adpositional morphological subcategorization is not possible.1 This chapter is
dedicated to elucidating the range of known inWx-creating ambiguities in
language. As such, it is also a diachronic typology of inWxation. I will show
that edge-oriented inWxes ultimately originate from adpositional aYxes
(i.e., preWxes or suYxes). Their peripheral origins give rise to their synchronic
edge-oriented proWle. Ultimately, it is the preponderance of such inWxes with
adpositional origin that gives rise to the observed Edge-Bias EVect.
5.1 Background
The study of morphological change in language began in earnest with the
Neogrammarians, who made major advances in the understanding of the role
analogy plays in morphological change. In particular, much eVort was
focused on matters of allomorphy reduction and paradigm uniformity as
responses to sound change. However, little attention was paid to the origins of
inWxation. There are notable exceptions, however. For example, Schmidt
(1906) discussed the possible origin of Mon-Khmer inWxes as the result
of entrapment; Ferdinand de Saussure (Ultan, 1975) intimated an explanation
of the origin of the nasal inWx in Indo-European in terms of entrapment
1 To be sure, inductive biases presumably apply regardless of the type of morphology involved. But
in cases of simple concatenative morphology (e.g., preWxation and suYxation), the type of inductive
bias maintained by the Pivot Theory might be less important since subcategorization can be stated
solely at the morphological level (e.g., with respect of the root or the stem).
(see Section 5.2.2 for a discussion of this mechanism). Sporadic mentions of
the possible origins of inWxes also appear in traditional grammatical descrip-
tions. For example, Boas and Deloria (1941) suggested that the inXectional
inWxes in Dakota resulted from the fusion of the locative preWxes with the
root. With the notable exception of Ultan (1975), the lack of attention to the
origins of inWxation persists.2 However, there are signs that researchers
are beginning to recognize the importance of understanding the origins of
inWxes; several reports on the origins of inWxes in various languages have
appeared in recent years (Anderson 1996; Garrett 2001; Haiman 1977, 2003;
Harris 2002; Martin 1994; Nichols 2005; Yu 2004b).
Ultan, in his pioneering work on the typology and origin of inWxation
(1975), discussed two main processes that give rise to inWxes: phonological/
morphological metathesis and entrapment. These processes will be discussed
in detail later in the chapter. BrieXy, he cited the Hebrew reXexive -t-,
Common Indonesian active and passive -um- and -in-, and Delaware third-
person -w@-, as instances of metathesis. Entrapment refers to the fusion of an
outer aYx with the stem, causing the intervening aYx to become an inWx.
He gave Dakota pronominals, Northwest Caucasian pronominals, Indo-
European -n-, Trukese -Vkk- durative, Miskitu construct state formation, and
Austro-Asiatic inWxations as instances of entrapment. While metathesis
and entrapment are certainly two major sources of inWxation, the precise nature
of these mechanisms remains largely unexplored in Ultan’s seminal paper.
This chapter builds on the insight of these earlier works to expand on and,
along the way, to revise the understanding of the diachronic landscape of the
genesis of inWxes. The chapter provides a state-of-the-art overview of the current
understanding of the development of inWxation. As in any study on diachronic
typology, one is invariably restricted by the amount of materials available in
the literature. Despite the recent surge of reports, the literature on the diachronic
change of inWxation remains far from ideal. Thus, in what follows, some of
the case studies are the results of original historical investigations.
5.2 Toward a diachronic typology of inWxation
Four diachronic pathways can be adduced from the available literature: phon-
etic metathesis in Section 5.2.1, morphological entrapment in Section 5.2.2,
2 The lack of attention to the historical development of morphological change might partly have to
do with the development of the Weld of linguistics in recent years. As Joseph and Janda (1988)
observed, morphology and historical linguistics were in complementary distribution during the
Generative era, for example; morphology is in vogue while Generative historical linguistics has just
gone out of fashion.
138 The secret history of inWxes
reduplication mutation in Section 5.2.3, and morphological excrescence in
Section 5.2.4. Each section contains a general discussion on the respective
mechanism of change and examples to illustrate more precisely the mechan-
ism in question. The focus below will be to elucidate the pathways through
which ambiguities in morphological parsing arise and which, through the
general mechanisms of reanalysis and analogical extension, ultimately lead to
the emergence of an inWx. Since the focus is the inception of inWxation, as such,
I shall have little to say regarding to the propagation or regularization of the
pattern once it is started.
5.2.1 Metathesis
Metathesis refers to the transposition between two segments, which can
be schematized as AB > BA. An example of phonological metathesis can be
found in Cayuga, a Northern Iroquoian language, where, according to Foster
(1982) (cited in Blevins and Garrett 1998: 509–10), /V?/ ! [?V] and /Vh/ !
[hV] in odd-number non-Wnal syllables. The relevant segments are underlined.

c. /ko?nikõha?/ ! [g?onı́khwa?] ‘her mind’
d. No change:
/akahwitá?ek/ ! [agahwisdá?ek] ‘it struck, chimed’
Many have suggested that inWxation can be the result of morphological
metathesis (e.g., Ultan 1975), that is, when morphemes A and B were in one
linear order historically, but their linear positions are found in the reverse in
the daughter language(s).
(2) *A+B > B+A
For example, the glottal stop mediopassive inWx that appears after the root
vowel in Tzutujil appears to have originated from a type of metathesis similar
to that found in Cayuga.
(3) Tzutujil mediopassive (Dayley 1985: 55, 113–14)

suYx /b’/ in the sixteenth century (i.e., *CVC-b’ > *CVC-? > CV?C) (Terry
Kaufman p.c.). The suYx /b’/ is still found in Mopan, a closely related
language.
The third-person marker in Copainalá Zoque, a Mixe-Zoque language
spoken in Southern Mexico, is realized as palatalization of the initial conson-
ant of a root if it begins with an alveolar consonant (i.e., d, ts, s, n) (4).
Otherwise, a palatal glide is inWxed after the initial consonant of the root
(4) (Wonderly 1951).

The third-person marker was historically a preWx *i- (e.g., Sierra Popoluca
?ika:ma: ‘his cornWeld’ < Proto-Zoque *kämä(k) ‘cornWeld’), which lenited
into a glide (e.g., South Zoque kajkama ‘cornWeld’). However, a general
palatal metathesis aVected the language and turned all *j + C sequences into
Cj in Copainalá Zoque (CZ), North Zoque (NZ), and Northeast Zoque
(NeZ). The non-metathesized reXex of *j can still be observed in Sierra
Popoluca (SP), South Zoque (SZ), and West Zoque (WZ) (Elson 1992).

CZ, NZ: hLpja ‘he weeps’ (SP: hLjpa ‘he speaks’ < PZoq *hLj + pa)

Morphological metathesis as such is not a useful concept for the understand-
ing of inWx origin, however, since it is merely a restatement of the fact. It oVers
no greater insight into the mechanisms through which inWxation develops. In
what follows, I build on a phonetic interpretation of metathesis advanced
in Blevins and Garrett (1998, 2005). Grounding the origins of metathesis on
articulatory and perceptual factors provides a more restrictive theory of
metathesis as a pathway of inWx emergence.
140 The secret history of inWxes
5.2.1.1 The phonetic origins of metathesis In a series of papers on the origins
of metathesis, Blevins and Garrett (1998, 2005), furthering the listener-
oriented theory of sound change (cf. Ohala 1993), propose that there are
four main types of metathesis: perceptual, compensatory, coarticulatory,3 and
auditory. They summarize these four types of metathesis as follows:
[Perceptual metathesis] involves features of intrinscially longer duration (e.g. phary-
ngealization); in multisegmental strings, such features are spread out over the entire
sequence, allowing them to be reinterpreted in non-historical positions. [Compensa-
tory metathesis] is prosodically conditioned: within a foot, features in a weak syllable
undergo temporal shifts into the strong syllable. [Coarticulatory metathesis] arises in
clusters of consonants with the same manner of articulation but diVerent places of
articulation; the place cues do not necessarily have long duration, and we will suggest
that metathesis results from coarticulation facilitated by shared articulatory gestures.
[Auditory metathesis] results from the auditory segregation of sibilant noise from the
rest of the speech stream.’ (Blevins and Garrett 2005: 120–1)
Of the four known triggers of phonological metathesis, perceptual metathesis
seems to be the only form of metathesis that gives rise to inWxation. A closer
look at Blevins and Garrett’s survey of metathesis reveals that there is a simple
explanation for this connection. To begin with, perceptual metathesis makes
up the bulk of the attested metathesis cases. Thus, it is not surprising that
there are more instances of inWxes that come from perceptual metathesis
than other metathesis triggers. Second, compensatory and coarticulatory
metatheses are best viewed as more restricted subtypes of perceptual metath-
esis (6). Both types of metathesis result from perceptual confusion induced by
extreme coarticulatory eVects. Compensatory metathesis diVers from general
perceptual metathesis in terms of its reference to prosodic conditioning
(i.e., the extreme coarticulatory overlap between a pair of stressed and
unstressed vowels). The so-called coarticulatory metathesis, which involves
extreme coarticulation, involves the overlapping of consonant sequences.
Thus, the fundamental mechanisms behind compensatory and coarticulatory
metatheses are no diVerent from that behind perceptual metathesis—
perceptual confusion induced by gestural overlaps.
(6) Mechanism of metathesis Subtypes
Perceptual metathesis Compensatory metathesis
Coarticulatory metathesis
Auditory metathesis
3 The label ‘coarticulatory metathesis’ is potentially confusing since, with the exception of auditory
metathesis, the other types of metathesis all involve coarticulation in one form or another. An
alternative label might be ‘obstruent gestural overlap metathesis’.
The secret history of inWxes 141
Crucially, the phonetic understanding of the origins of metathesis makes
predictions about possible types of metathesis-induced inWxes that are not
possible under the morphological view of metathesis. To begin with, the set of
potential metathesis-induced inWxes is restricted to the set of segments with
‘stretch-out’ phonetic features that are amenable to perceptual confusion.
This class of phonetic objects with elongated acoustic cues includes labials,
palatals, pharyngeals, laryngeals, liquids, and rhotics. The phonetic origin of
metathesis also predicts that only a single segment can be involved in a
‘transposition’ at a given time. InWxations that involve the transposition
of groups of segments do not lend themselves readily to a phonetic misinter-
pretation account of metathesis (see also Janda 1984). Another major feature
of metathesis-induced inWxations is that their synchronic exponents often do
not match their historical sources. This unfaithful nature of the metathesized
segment Wnds a natural explanation under this phonetic view of metathesis.
I elaborate on this point in the next section.
5.2.1.2 Metathesis without faithfulness The mismatches in form between
metathesis-induced inWxes and their historical sources are commonplace.
For example, in Lepcha, a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Sikkim on the
southern fringe of Tibet, the alternation between intransitive and transitive
verbs can be marked by the inWxing of -j- after the initial consonant (Benedict
1943; Ultan 1975; Voegelin and Voegelin 1965).
(7) pok ‘cast down’ pjok ‘cause to cast down’
thor ‘escape, get free’ thjor ‘let go, set free’
rop ‘stick, adhere’ rjop ‘aYx, attach’
nak ‘to be straight’ njak ‘make straight’
nom ‘smell (intr.)’ njom ‘smell (tr.)’
Benedict (1943) found that the inWx originated from the Tibeto-Burman
causative preWx *s-, as illustrated by the following cognate forms in Tibetan:
(8) Lepcha nom ‘smell (intr.)’ Tibetan mnam-pa
Lepcha njom ‘smell (tr.)’ Tibetan snam-pa
The change from *s- to -j- might seem anomalous at Wrst glance. However,
this outcome is to be expected given the phonetic mechanism that gave rise to
metathesis in the Wrst place. No segment was ever transposed. The palatal
glide inWx in Lepcha was originally conditioned by the coarticulatory
eVect of the initial s. When *s was lost in initial consonant clusters, the
listener reinterpreted what was previously coarticulatory palatalization as
morphological. As predicted by the phonetic explanation of metathesis, the
142 The secret history of inWxes
metathesis-induced change that aVected the intransitive/transitive alternation
also aVected other parts of the Lepcha lexicon. As shown in (9), other words
reconstructed to begin with an s-initial consonant cluster show reXexes that
contain a post-consonantal palatal.
(9) Tibeto-Burman Lepcha
*s-na ‘nose’ > njo ‘snot’
*s-nam ‘daughter-in-law’ > njom ‘daughter-in-law’
*s-min > mjăn ‘to be ripe’
Thus the Lepcha example highlights an important aspect of metathesis-
induced inWxation. The term ‘metathesis’ is often deWned as the reordering
of segments or features within the phonological string (e.g., Blevins and
Garrett 2005; Hume 2001). The ‘reordering’ metaphor gives the impression
that the metathesized segment is ontologially one and the same as the
‘original’ segment. The Lepcha example points to a major problem with
such an interpretation of metathesis. The inWx in Lepcha did not strictly
speaking transpose from one linear position to another. There was never a
transitivizing palatal glide morpheme in Tibeto-Burman. The source of
palatality came from the coarticulatory eVect of the initial alveolar sibilant.
This type of ‘unfaithful’ metathesis is actually rather typical of metathesis in
general and especially of metathesis-induced inWxes. For example, while
the glottal inWx in Tzutujil was previously understood as the result of the
reordering of the glottal stop (*CVC-b’ > *CVC-? > CV?C), the phonetic
view of metathesis invites an alternative interpretation. Since the cues for
glottalization often stretch out across long distances, at the time when the
suYx -b’- was still present, we could expect some degree of laryngealization
on the root vowel (i.e., *CV
˜
C-b’). The disappearance of the -b’- suYx
prompted the listener to attribute the laryngealization on the root vowel to
the presence of an intrinsic glottal stop (i.e., CV?C). This scenario obviates
the need to posit an intermediate stage where the original -b’- suYx reduced
to a glottal stop (*CVC-?) Wrst before metathesizing to its contemporary
post-root vowel distribution. Under the present theory, the pathway is much
more direct: *CV
˜
C-b’ > CV?C. To be sure, an important feature of this theory
is its reliance on the mechanism of coarticulation as the ultimate source of
metathesis. This theory thus predicts the co-existence of the coarticulatory
eVect and its source within the same language, all else being equal. Such
a prediction is conWrmed in the case of the class 3 noun inWx in several
Benuo-Congo languages. In these languages, the inWx -w- came from the
reconstructed preWx *u.

Given the propensity for metathesis-induced inWxes to be formally unfaithful
to their historical antecedents and since telescoping often obscures the ori-
ginal contexts of the change, tracing the source of metathesis-induced inWxes
is not an easy task. Yet the reward can be impressive if such an endeavor is
successful. This point is most eVectively demonstrated in the case of diminu-
tive inWxation in the Pingding dialect of Mandarin.
5.2.1.3 InWxation in Pingding Mandarin Pingding is a dialect of Mandarin
Chinese spoken in the Shanxi province of China. Like most Mandarin dialects,
Pingding has a diminutive/hypocoristic aYxation process. However, unlike
other dialects, in which this process is marked by the suYxing of a retroXexed
morpheme (i.e., -er), the cognate morpheme in Pingding, realized as
a retroXex lateral -´-, is inWxed between the onset and the rhyme of a syllable.

This inWxation pattern is puzzling in several respects. First, the syllable

144 The secret history of inWxes
where ‘G’ stands for a glide (i.e., j or w). Thus, it is surprising that inWxation
should create onset clusters which are otherwise not attested elsewhere in the
language. On top of that, a retroXex lateral is not commonly found in
descriptions of Mandarin phonetic inventory (e.g., Chao 1968; Duanmu
2000; Li and Thompson 1981). The appearance of a retroXex lateral only in
forms with inWxation also demands an explanation.
Yu (2004b) explains the development of Pingding inWxation as follows:
Pingding inWxation was the result of metathesis of the suYx -r from post-
vocalic to pre-vocalic position. Rhotic metathesis is commonplace in the
world’s languages. This is, for example, found in the history of English (e.g.,
third < OE þridda, bird < OE brid). Blevins and Garrett (1998, 2005) attribute
the cause of rhotic metathesis to listener misperception fueled by the long
phonetic cues of rhotics (e.g., lower F3). That is, the coarticulatory acoustic
cues of the rhotic permeate the neighboring vowel, making it diYcult for
the listener to recover the actual location of the rhotic. In English, what
apparently happened was that some speakers misinterpreted the location of
the rhotic as pre-vocalic, rather than as post-vocalic, thus resulting in the
current metathesized forms. Similarly, the fact that the post-vocalic diminu-
tive suYx -r in Mandarin surfaces in pre-vocalic positions in Pingding
Mandarin is analyzed as a hypercorrective response (Ohala 1993) to the
extensive anticipatory eVect of -r. That is, the unintentional anticipatory
eVect of -r causes the preceding vowel to be heavily rhoticized. This presents
to the listener a problem in localizing the source of the coarticulatory eVect
since rhoticization could be caused by either a pre-vocalic or post-vocalic
retroXex. The ancestral Pingding speakers opted for a pre-vocalic analysis,
hence the seed of diminutive inWxation in Pingding. One crucial diVerence
between Pingding rhotic metathesis and similar sound changes such as in
English, is that rhotic metathesis in Pingding has grammatical consequences.
That is, a previously suYxing morphological process is now an inWxing
phenomenon. One puzzle that remains unresolved is why the diminutive
inWx is not a straightforward -r- in Pingding. Where does the retroXexed
lateral -´- come from? The answer lies in a similar construction found in the
Yanggu dialect of Mandarin.
The diminutive construction in Yanggu, a dialect of Mandarin spoken in
Shandong, varies depending on the shape of the lexical host to which it is
attached. Dong (1985) reports that, in general, [] is suYxed to the root.

In Yu (2004b), I argue that the appearance and the distribution of the lateral
in Yanggu diminutive formation just in the case where the initial consonant is
dental is the result of the drastic transition from an anterior sound to the
rhotacized vowel.5 This abrupt transition apparently yielded a percept of a
4 While Dong transcribes the Yanggu inWxing lateral as a plain lateral he does acknowledge the fact
that this lateral is slightly further back, and very similar to a retroXex sound (Dong 1985: 276, n. 3).
Dong also points out that the vowels that follow the inserted [l] are invariably rhotacized (Dong 1985:
n. 5), suggesting that the sound represented as l might be more accurately transcribed as [´].
5 The distribution of the retroXexed lateral is more complicated than what is reproduced here.

transitional approximant, which was reinterpreted as a purposeful gesture
and was subsequently phonemicized as a retroXex lateral.
The Yanggu pattern thus represents the missing link between Standard
Chinese r-suYxation and the present-day Pingding inWxing pattern.
The development of Pingding inWxation is schematized below:

Original suYxation of -r (Stage 1) gave rise to the conditioned emergence of a
prenucleus lateral like that found in Yanggu (Stage 2). Before the development of
a full-blown inWxing patterninPingding, the original Wnal -r must have been lost
atsomepoint,leavinganalternation betweenretroXex lateralinWxation inwords
that begin with anterior sounds, and regular r-suYxation in other forms (Stage
3). The available Pingding data does not provide evidence for the independent
loss of syllable-Wnal rhotics. However, such a change is observed in neighboring
dialects of Mandarin Chinese. Qian et al. (1985) report that the words ‘child, ear,
two’, all pronounced as [] in Standard Chinese, are pronounced as [´@] in some
dialects of Mandarin in the Pingdu county of the Shandong Province,
while other dialects within the same county vary between [] and [´@]. Once
the rhotic metathesis sound change was complete, the pressure of paradigm
leveling must have regularized the inWxing pattern (Stage 4). The resultant
inWxation pattern requires -´- be inserted before the nucleus. Thus, when a
word is vowel-initial, -´- appears as preWxing (e.g., in Pingding u ‘pot’ ! ´u).
5.2.1.4 Summary The phonetic interpretation of metathesis presupposes the
listener’s misidentiWcation of the source of certain elongated phonetic cues.
This emphasis on long phonetic cues makes two crucial predictions. It
restricts the class of metathesizable segments, and by extension the class of
metathesis-induced inWxes, to labials, palatals, pharyngeals, laryngeals,
liquids, and rhotics. It also suggests that metathesis can ‘transpose’ only one
segment at a time. The listener-misperception view of metathesis also explains
The secret history of inWxes 147
why the ‘transposed’ object does not always resemble its original source:
metathesis, for the most part, stems from misparsing introduced by
coarticulation, and coarticulatory eVects often do not exhibit the same
phonetic features as their sources.
In this section, I introduced the mechanism of metathesis-induced inWxa-
tion and explained its properties. The source of reanalysis in the case of
metathesis ultimately stems from the inWx itself; that is, the ambiguities
develop out of the aYx in question. In the next section, I review a class of
inWxes which emerge as victims of their environment. They are helpless
orphans, as it were, caught in the fusional forces of grammaticalization.
5.2.2 Entrapment
Entrapment refers to the scenario in which a morpheme is stranded between a
fossilized composite of an aYx and a root. That is, in a composite zyX where z
and y are historical adpositional aYxes (i.e., preWxes and suYxes), z merges
with the root X to form a new root zX, where the independent existence of z
or X is no longer recoverable synchronically. The morpheme y is said to be
entrapped in a form like xyZ, between the historical adWx z and the historical
root X. Entrapment is the most often invoked explanation of inWx emergence.
As noted earlier, Schmidt, Saussure, Boas and Delaria, and Ultan all discuss
possible instances of entrapment-based inWxation, even if they do not explore
the precise mechanism of this process in detail. Many other cases of entrap-
ment have since been proposed, most notably the pronominal inWxes in the
Nakh-Daghestanian languages (Harris 2002; Nichols 2005). Here, I focus on
an example of entrapment found in the languages of the Muskogean family.
5.2.2.1 Muskogean inWxation The Muskogean languages of the southeastern
United States are divided into four subgroups (classiWcation based on Martin
and Munro 2005):
(17) a. Chickasaw and Choctaw (the ‘Western’ languages)
b. Alabama and Koasati (and possibly Apalachee)
c. Hitchiti and Mikasuki
d. Creek (including Muskogee, Oklahoma Seminole, and the Florida
Seminole dialect of Creek)
Several inWxation patterns are found in these languages. While their functions
range from agreement marking to punctuality, their locations are remarkably
restricted. For examples, the plural marker (18a) in Mikasuki and the subject
pronominal ‘actor’ markers (18b) in Koasati appear as the penultimate syllable
of the inXected stem.

The pre-Wnal syllable distribution of the Muskogean inWxes in (18) is the result of
historical fusion of a verb-auxiliary complex. That is, aYxes that were historic-
ally preWxed to the auxiliary verb are now ‘trapped’ between the main verb and
the historically separate auxiliary. To explain this development more concretely,
a brief overview of Proto-Muskogean verbal morphology is in order.
Proto-Muskogean (PM) had an ‘active’ system of person marking with two
series of person markers. Subjects of most transitives and agentive intransi-
tives were marked by Series I markers, while transitive objects and subjects of
non-agentive intransitive verbs were marked by Series II. I shall focus on the
development of the Series I markers since only the reXexes of this series may
appear inWxing in the daughter languages. Booker (1979: 33) reconstructs the
Proto-Muskogean ‘actor’ Series I markers as follows:
(20) Singular Dual Plural
1 *-li Excl. *ili- *ha-ili-
Incl. *ili-ho-
2 *či- *ha-či-
There were four voice-related morphological classes of PM verbs: neutral
verbs (with no overt marking of voice), middle verbs (with the middle
auxiliary *-ka), active verbs (with the active auxiliary *-li), and causative
6 An epenthetic i is inserted before consonant clusters in Alabama and Koasati while a copy of the
preceded vowel is inserted in the Western languages.
The secret history of inWxes 149
verbs (generally with causative auxiliary *-či). PM is also reconstructed to
have two verbal paradigms, the Direct vs Periphrastic paradigms. In the
direct paradigm, the person markers were preWxed to the last auxiliary in the
voiced verb class or directly to the lexical verb in the neutral verb class. In
the periphrastic paradigm, an extra auxiliary was added to the main verb and
the person markers were preWxed to this extra auxiliary. The two verbal
paradigms and their person-marking patterns are illustrated in (21). The
schemas are adopted from Martin and Munro (2005), who analyze the
person markers as clitics (Clt). The *-t marker in (21b) indicates same-
subject switch-reference.

Voiced verb Verb Aux Verb Clt-Aux

The inWxal distribution of the person markers illustrated in (18b) emerges
partly from the grammaticalization of the once distinct auxiliary verbs. That
is, when the auxiliary fused with the main verb, the person markers previously
preWxed to the auxiliary verb now obtained a penultimate distribution since
the auxiliaries were all monosyllabic. This penultimate distribution of the
person marker was analogically extended to verbs that were neutral and
monomorphemic, like huhca ‘to dig’ in (18b). The Proto-Muskogean plural
*oho- aYx developed into a pre-Wnal syllable inWx, -ho-, in Creek-Seminole
and Hitchiti-Mikasuki (Martin 1994) through essentially the same mech-
anism. As already illustrated in (18a), the plural -ho- appears before the
Wnal syllable. Crucially, the singular stem is monomorphemic.
Besides this grammaticalization-induced pre-Wnal syllable inWxation
pattern, as noted earlier, certain aYxes in the Muskogean languages show a
post-Wrst vowel distribution (see (19)). For example, the mediopassive
proclitic *il- in PM appears after the applicative *a- and the plural
*oho-. In the Southern Muskogean languages, however, it appears as an
inWx. (Data in (22) are drawn from Martin and Munro 2005: 315–16.)

b. PM *oho-icca ‘shoot’ *oho-il-icca ‘be shot’
Alabama hocca ‘shoot’ holicca ‘be shot’

Martin and Munro (2005) attribute the synchronic distribution of this med-
iopassive inWx to the reanalysis of the preWxes, *a- and *oho-, as part of
certain neutral verbs, thus trapping the intervening aYx *il-. Subsequent
analogical extension to etymological monomorphic forms gives rise to the
post-Wrst vowel distribution observed in (19).
5.2.2.2 Symptoms and predictions of entrapment Entrapment as understood
in the present work makes several important predictions. To begin with, unlike
metathesis (and the other mechanisms to be reviewed below), where the
source of ambiguity that triggers reanalysis ultimately stems from the inWx
itself (i.e., aYx-internal pressure), entrapment comes from changes that occur
in the environment (i.e., aYx-external pressure). The encroachment of the
surroundings results in the entrapment of an historical adpositional aYx. This
means that any adpositional aYxes that ordinarily appear in the imperiled
location are going to be trapped regardless of their functions or forms. The rise
of the pronominal inWxes in the Muskogean languages exempliWes this; when
the main verb and the auxiliary undergo univerbation, all aYxes that were
originally preWxed to the auxiliary now appear internal to the univerbated
verb+auxiliary complex. This scenario also predicts that languages with
entrapment-induced inWxes may show what might be referred to as the
Stem-class eVect. That is, an aYx might appear in an arbitrary class of stem
as inWxing, while aYxing adpositionally in others. This is a ubiquitous
prediction of entrapment not shared by any other pathways to inWxation.
For example, recall that Proto-Muskogean had an ‘actor’ person paradigm in
(20). While the Wrst-person singular marker suYxed to the main verb or the
auxiliary, the other person markers were all preWxing either directly to the
main verb or to the auxiliary. As illustrated in (18b), the reXexes of the
PM person markers in Koasati may appear inWxing within certain verbs.
However, person markers may also appear preWxing with respect to other verbs
(see (23)). Whether averb takes preWxal or inWxal person markers must be lexically
determined. The two classes of verbs cannot be distinguished phonologically.

Similarly, pronominal aYxes in Lakhota (also known as Dakota), a Siouan
language, appear inWxed in some forms, but not in others, even though
phonologically speaking, such stems are nearly identical (24).

Likewise in Dargi, which belongs to the Lak-Dargi subgroup of the Daghes-
tanian branch of the East Caucasian languages, gender markers (25) may be
preWxed (e.g., B-ak’ ‘come’, B-it ‘hit’, B-elč’ ‘read’), inWxed (e.g., ka<B>i? ‘sit
down’, ka<B>ac’ ‘descend’, a<B>ac’ ‘ascend’, če<B>a? ‘see’), or suYxed
(e.g., sa-B ‘be (exist)’, le-B ‘be present (here)’).7

Stem-classes are found beyond the domain of person aYxes as well. For
example, the imperfect in Kentakbong, an Austro-Asiatic language, is marked
by the preWxing of ?@n- to monosyllabic stems (26a), while inWxing -@n- to
disyllabic stems (26b) (Omar 1975).

/cãs/ ‘excretes’ ?encãs ‘excretes.IMPRF’
b. /citOh/ ‘cooks’ cenitOh ‘cooks.IMPRF’
/sapoh/ ‘sweeps’ senapoh ‘sweeps, is sweeping’
Why does -@n- inWx to disyllabic words but not to the monosyllabic ones
(e.g., co ‘speaks’ ! ?@nco not *c@no)? To be sure, the predicted pattern is
found in Katu, a language related to Kentakbong, where a VC aYx, -an-, can
be inWxed to monosyllabic stems (27), as well as in polysyllabic forms
(Costello 1998).
7 Following the notation of van den Berg (1999), the sign < > indicates an inWx and a gender class
marker is represented by capital B.

pók ‘to make idol’ panók ‘idol’
This stem-class phenomenon is a natural corollary of entrapment. As
mentioned above, entrapment results from external pressures operating
independently of the entrapped aYx in question. As such, the stranded aYx
falls victim, as it were, to the grammaticalization and fusion of other aYxes
with the stem. While this scenario predicts the eventual emergence of an
inWxal distribution of the stranded aYx, it also crucially allows for the
possibility of the would-be-stranded aYx to remain adpositional under the
appropriate circumstances. For example, the reason why certain verbs in
Koasati conjugate with a preWxal pronominal paradigm rather than an inWxal
one is because, when inXected in the Direct Paradigm, person markers in PM
were preWxed to neutral verbs directly (28a). Verbs in Koasati admit inWxal
person markers only if the verbs are reXexes of PM voiced verbs inXected in
the Direct Paradigm (28b) or verbs, voiced or otherwise, inXected in the
Periphrastic Paradigm (28c and d). While the inWxal distribution of person
markers has apparently been analogically extended to certain original directly
inXected neutral verbs, many neutral verbs continue to inXect person
information preWxally.

The situation in Kentakbong can be understood in a similar way. Schmidt (1906)
proposes that inWxes in Austro-Asiatic languages today are the result of the
fusion of certain historical preWxes with roots. Thus, all else being equal, roots
that do not take preWxes historically (e.g., monosyllabic roots today) should
not give rise to any inWx, as no entrapment could have taken place. On the
other hand, the Katu pattern can be understood as the result of a subsequent
analogical extension of the inWxing pattern to historical monomorphemic
forms. Finally, in the case of Dargi, van den Berg notes that the inWxal class
The secret history of inWxes 153
is likely the result of the development of the local and directional preWxes on
the verb into synchronic petriWed elements (van den Berg 1999: 167, n. 5)
In sum, given our understanding of entrapment, it is not surprising that
aYxes might develop divergent subcategorization requirements despite their
surface homophonous realizations. This balkanizing view of the lexicon and
treatment of inWxes is supported by the fact that many, if not all, known or
suspected cases of entrapment-induced inWxation (e.g., Dakota, Lezgian, and
the Muskogean languages) only apply to a subset of stems in the language.
A key feature of reanalysis is that ambiguities can often be resolved in
multiple ways (cf. CHOICE in Blevins 2004). Morphological parsing ambigu-
ities resulting from entrapment are no diVerent in this regard. An aYx that is
stranded within a univerbated verb-auxiliary complex can be analogically
restored to its adpositional location if the aYx’s original adpositional distri-
bution is preserved elsewhere in the language. Thus, in the Muskogean case,
given the fact that the person markers are realized as strictly preWxing to the
formerly directly inXected neutral verbs, the stranded person markers at the
stage of univerbation could have been analogically restored to their preWxal
patterns with respect to the newly formed verbs. Yet, in Koasati, it is the inWxal
pattern that is extended, rather than the preWxal paradigm. Why is one analysis
preferred over the other? Under such a circumstance, resolution often
depends on other factors independent of the aYxes in question. In the last
chapter, I have advanced one such factor—the Pivot Theory. However, besides
considerations from learning, language-internal factors may also tilt the bal-
ance toward one analysis over another. A case from Hua illustrates this point.
5.2.2.3 Hua In Hua, a language in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New
Guinea, pronominal aYxes on transitive verbs and inalienable possessed
nouns are generally preWxed, as illustrated in the following paradigm:
(29) Nominal Verbal
Sg. 1 d-za? ‘my hand’ d-ge ‘he sees me’
2 g-za? ‘your hand’ g-ge ‘he sees you’
3 Ø-za? ‘his/her hand’ Ø-ge ‘he sees him/her’
Du. 1 ra?-za? ‘our hand’ ra?-ge ‘he sees us two’
2/3 pa?-za? ‘your/their hand’ pa?-ge ‘he sees you/them’
Pl. 1 r-za? ‘our hand’ r-ge ‘he sees us’
2/3 p-za? ‘your/their hand’ p-ge ‘he sees you/him’
However, in a small number of extremely common nominal and verbal roots,
all beginning with the stressed sequence há, these pronouns are sometimes
inWxed. There are approximately two dozen such words, but it can be
154 The secret history of inWxes
productively extended even to roots which do not usually occur with
pronouns for semantic reasons (e.g., háivuva ‘root of tree’ ! ha-nd-áivuva).
(30) Hua person markers (Haiman 1980: 561)
Person haipai- ‘explain, tell’ hamu? ‘namesake’

2 sg. ha-g-apai- ha-g-amu?
3 sg. hapai- hamu?

2/3 du. fa?apai- fa?amu?
1 pl. ha-r-apai- ha-r-amu?
2/3 pl. fapai- famu?
The person markers must have been historically preWxal, as comparative
evidence from closely related languages suggests. Thus the question one
must address is why inWxation only takes place with words that begin with a
há sequence.
Based on the pairs of examples in (31), Haiman (1977) argues that ha was
historically a preWx, although its original function is now lost. The prenasa-
lization of d- in the 1 sg. form in (30) also suggests that ha might have been
originally a proclitic since prenasalization of b and d generally only occurs
word-initially, not word-internally. Thus, the fact that the 1 sg. form of
‘namesake’ is ha-nd-amu? and not *ha-d-amu? shows that d must have
been word-initial at some point. The historical preWx ha- must have fused
with the root, trapping the pronominals in the process.

The entrapment analysis predicts, however, that the Wrst-person singular form
of hamu? ‘namesake’ should be *ha-nd-mu?, not ha-nd-amu?, as attested.
There is an extra -a- in the inWxed form that is unaccounted for. Haiman
hypothesizes that pre-Hua speakers, using abductive reasoning (Andersen
1973), must have reinterpreted all words beginning in the stressed há as
underlyingly a sequence of ha+á, based on the existence of an independent
rule of vowel coalescence that reduces a sequence of identical vowels through
the deletion of the unstressed vowel (e.g., ha#á ! há). This analysis creates an
The secret history of inWxes 155
ambiguity in the third-person singular words. Take, for example, the 3 sg.
form of hámu? ‘namesake’. Following the logic of Watkins’ Law, which
refers to a situation where a 3 sg. form provides the basis for a visible
restructuring of its entire paradigm since it is susceptible to more than one
analysis by virtue of a null third-person singular marker (Watkins 1962),
Haiman argues that two analyses of hámu? ‘his namesake’ are possible.
The third-person singular marker could be analyzed as preWxing (i.e.,
Ø+ha+ámu) or between the preWx ha and a hypothetical stem ámu
(i.e., ha+Ø+ámu). Haiman argues that a prohibition of C+h sequences in
Hua provided the incentive for choosing the inWxal over the preWxal
analysis. That is, whenever C+h sequences might be generated as a result
of morpheme concatenation, a periphrasis construction is used instead. For
example, when the transitive verb háko ‘look for’ takes a benefactive case,
instead of *dhake, one Wnds dgaisi?hake. A strictly semantic explanation
would not be able to account for why háke with the null third -person
marker is possible (i.e., háke ‘he looked for him’). In the case of hámu?
‘namesake’, Haiman argues that the analytic ambiguities aVorded by the null
third-person singular marker must have extended to the other person
markers in the paradigm as well. Thus in the case of ‘your namesake’, two
possible analyses became available (i.e., *g+ha+ámu or *ha+g+ámu). The
preWxing option is duly discouraged as a result of the ban on C+h sequences
(i.e., *g+ha+ámu).
The Hua example highlights the fact that the mechanism of entrapment is
often part of a larger story behind the creation of new inWxes. The main
ingredient of an entrapment scenario is the obscuring of morphological
boundaries due to morphological fusion between distinct stems and aYxes.
Harris (2002) refers to such developments as ‘univerbation’. But as we have
seen in this section, not all entrapment cases involve the fusion of a verb stem
with a verbal aYx. While entrapment creates the impetus for reanalysis, other
aspects of the phonology and morphology of the language might come into
play in shaping the destiny of a burgeoning inWx.
5.2.2.4 Summary This section has introduced and exempliWed the
mechanism of entrapment. Unlike metathesis, the forces that drive this type
of reanalysis originate external to the aYx in question. As such, the inWxes
that have emerged are the victims of happenstance. They are in the wrong
place at the wrong time, as it were, and are merely passive participants that are
caught in the current of grammaticalization. It is this defenselessness of the
aYxes that allows entrapment to aVect more than one aYx at a time. It is also
the passivity of the aYxes that allows them to preserve their phonological

composition, unlike in the case of metathesis. In the next section, I review a
class of inWxes that is aVected by another kind of externally imposed change,
but the outcome is far more drastic than in the case of entrapment.
5.2.3 Reduplication mutation
Thus far, I have considered only cases of inWxation that developed out of
historical adpositional Wxed-segment aYxes. This section looks at a class of
inWxes that can all be traced back to some historical adWxal reduplication
process. However, the resultant inWx often does not bear a close resemblance
to its source. To understand this type of change, reduplication mutation, let
us Wrst look at a simple illustration that does not involve the creation of an
inWx.
5.2.3.1 Hausa pluractionals Pluractional reduplication in Hausa, a Chadic
language spoken in Nigeria, historically involved reduplicating the two
rightmost syllables of the verb, with the concomitant deletion of the
original stem-Wnal vowel (Newman 1971). The reduplicant is bold-faced in
the following examples.
(32) *yagala yagalgàlaa ‘tear to shreds’
*kucina kucincı̀naa ‘break pieces oV’
*taºare taºarºàree ‘strive hard’
In Hausa today, however, most pluractional verbs are formed by reduplicating
the initial CVC of the stem, where C2 assimilates to the following abutting
consonant or undergoes rhotacization.
(33) Singular Pluractional Gloss
tunàa tuntùnaa ‘remind’
gaskàtaa gasgaskàtaa ‘verify’
kaamàa kankàamaa [ka˛kàamaa] ‘catch’
bugàa bubbùgaa ‘beat’
raatàyaa rarraatàyaa ‘hang’
fı̀ta fı̀r̃fı̀ta ‘go out’
The question here is why the original disyllabic suYxing reduplication
pattern was replaced by a preWxing CVC-reduplication pattern. Newman
(1971) attributes this shift to the reinterpretation of surface ambiguous output
strings. SpeciWcally, stem-Wnal vowel dropping in the environment of suYxa-
tion, a process that is still active today, created favorable conditions for
various phonological processes that target preconsonantal consonants.
These phonological processes had many eVects on the stem consonant
(e.g., the result of Wnal vowel dropping) immediately preceding the
The secret history of inWxes 157
reduplicant. A summary with illustrations of these processes is given in (34).
The aVected segment is underlined.
(34) Rhotacization of a coda consonant: *gadgadaa > gar̃gadaa ‘rutted
road’
Place assimilation of a coda nasal: *jàar̃ùmtakàa > jàar̃ùntakàa
‘bravery’
Complete assimilation of certain consonants: *zàafzaafaa > zàzzaafaa
‘very hot’
Shortening of long vowels and lowering of mid vowels in closed
syllables:
*saaboon gidaan àbookiinsà > saaban gidan àbookinsà ‘his friend’s new
house’
Some examples illustrating these processes in pluractional reduplication are
given below:
(35) Singular Historical Pluractional Actual Pluractional Gloss
Wta ! *WtWta > Wr
~
Wta ‘go out’
bugáa ! *bugbuga > bubbúgaa ‘beat’
jéefaa ! *jeefjeVa > jájjeefáa ‘throw’
soomáa ! *soomsooma > sansóomaa ‘begin’
Newman argues that the reduplicant of the pluractional forms retains the full
form of the underlying verb in the case of the disyllabic stems due to these
phonological processes, while the original stem was deformed, in some cases,
quite drastically. Thus, presumably due to the eVect of paradigm uniformity
between the singular and pluractional forms (e.g., bugàa/bubbùgaa ‘beat’;
soomàa/sansòomaa ‘begin’), the pluractional form is reanalyzed morphologic-
ally in such a fashion that the positions of the stem and the reduplicant are
reversed, as illustrated by the examples below.
(36) *bubbúgaa > bubbúgaa ‘beat’
*Wrr̃Wta > Wr̃Wta ‘go out’
*jájjeefáa > jájjeefáa ‘throw’
*sansóomaa > sansóomaa ‘begin’
Thus Hausa pluractional construction illustrates the general phenomenon
of reanalysis induced by ambiguities between the identities of the base and the
reduplicant. In the present case, it is the historical base of reduplication that is
altered by sound changes, which prompted speakers to identify the historical
reduplicant as the base, as it resembles more closely the non-reduplicated
stem than the actual historical base.

Reanalysis
This type of morphological change comes close to being an instance of
morphological metathesis since reduplication-mutation involves morphemes
exchanging linear position, say, from suYxing to preWxing (e.g., Xa > aX,
where X is the root, while a denotes an aYx). As illustrated in the next section,
this appearance of morphological metathesis is less clear when the result of
reduplication-mutation is internal reduplication, however.
5.2.3.2 Hopi plural formation An inWxal analog to the Hausa example is
found in Hopi. The plural in nouns is traditionally marked by preWxing CV-
preWxing reduplication in Hopi (Jeanne 1982). In the plural, the root vowel is
shortened if it is underlyingly long (38a), otherwise, it disappears (38b).8

moosa moomosa ‘cat’
b. koho kokho ‘wood’
como cocmo ‘hill’

8 Jeanne (1982) argues that vowel reduction is the result of interconsonantal vowel deletion (V ! Ø
/ VC __ C0V), although this rule applies to a subset of lexical items only (e.g., pitanakci ‘hat’ not
*pitnakci). However, upon closer examination, it seems possible that vowel reduction is stress-
conditioned. In particular, this appears to be an instance of post-tonic vowel reduction. In the
reduplicated forms, stress is always on the Wrst syllable. This means that, prior to the development
of vowel reduction, stress would have been on the root vowel. Thus a form like láho ‘bucket’ would
have been reduplicated as *lálaho (the reduplicant is underlined). Assuming that post-tonic vowel
reduction caused the root vowel to disappear, then the modern-day reXex should be lálho. This
prediction is borne out. This historical analysis crucially assumes that the stress assignment on
reduplicated forms diVers from that of the unreduplicated forms in Pre-Hopi, however. In Hopi
today, stress is on the initial syllable if the initial syllable is heavy (¼ CV:, CVC), otherwise, stress is on
the second syllable. Thus, stress is on the second syllable in words like laqána ‘squirrel’ and tayáti ‘to
laugh’, not *láqana or *táyati respectively. Further research is needed to ascertain the validity of this
post-tonic vowel reduction analysis.

According to Kershner (1999), younger speakers of Hopi have developed
internal reduplication. The evidence concerns the behavior of the set of
p-initial forms in (38c). The main contention with respect to the examples
in (38c) concerns the status of n in Hopi. According to Jeanne (1982), n is an
allophone of /p/ in the speech of the older speakers of Hopi (OG). This is
evidenced by the alternation of root-initial /p/ to [v] under preWxation (39).
In contrast, younger speakers of Hopi (YG) have innovated a phoneme /v/, as
shown by the non-alternation of /p/ and /v/ in intervocalic position (e.g.,
?ipana ‘my elder brother’).
(39) Bare OG YG
poosi ‘eye’ ?i-vosi ?i-posi ‘my eye’
poyo ‘knife’ ?i-voyo ?i-poyo ‘my knife’
paasa ‘Weld’ ?i-vasa ?i-pasa ‘my Weld’
pono ‘stomach’ ?i-vono ?i-pono ‘my stomach’
paava ‘elder brother’ ?i-vava ?i-pava ‘my elder brother’
The restoration of [p] in intervocalic position by the young Hopi speakers
renders the allophonic status of n opaque, which in turn obscures the original
preWx-plus-root relationship in the case of reduplication. The preWxal analysis
of the reduplicant is no longer recoverable based on the surface forms.
A schematic representation of the shift from preWxing reduplication to
internal reduplication in Hopi is shown in (40).

160 The secret history of inWxes
Previously, a form like poovosi ‘eyes’ could be analyzed as the result of preWxing
reduplication with lenition of the root-initial /p/ and shortening of the root-
vowel. After the phonemicization of /v/, it is no longer clear how n can be related
to the bare form poosi ‘eye’. In fact, [p] appears to have become an allophone of
/v/. That is, /v/ ‘hardens’ to [p] in coda position (e.g., heena ‘to Wnd’ becomes
hepni9 ‘to Wnd.FUT’). Pressures of paradigm uniformity should therefore favor
analyzing the internal -vo- string as the exponent of the plural feature (i.e., poosi:
poo-vo-si, not poo-vosi) since the inWxing analysis oVers a more transparent
mapping from the singular to the plural. To be sure, the precondition for an
internal reduplication analysis of Hopi nominal plural formation is already
present in the speech of the older generation of Hopi speakers. That is, as a
result of vowel reduction, the root vowel may be completely eliminated in the
reduplicated form when the root vowel is underlyingly short (see (38a)). But
since vowel reduction is a productive phenomenon in the language, the disap-
pearance of the root vowel is to be expected. Thus whether or not the redupli-
cative pattern of the older generation Hopi speakers should be considered an
instance of internal reduplication is a matter of theoretical debate. Many
languages show reduplicative alternation similar to that found in Hopi (see
also the discussion on Northern Interior Salish diminutive reduplication
below). Depending on their theoretical inclinations, analysts often diVer in
their interpretations of such patterns. For example, in Pima, a Uto-Aztecan
language related to Hopi, plurality is marked by C or CVreduplication similar to
that found in Hopi. (Examples are taken from Riggle 2006.)

mavit mamvit ‘lion’
koson kokson ‘pack rat’
sipuk sispuk ‘cardinal’
b. havol hahavol ‘lima bean’
?iput ?i?iput ‘circle’

While Pima plural reduplication may be analyzed as a case of preWxing
reduplication (i.e., root vowel deletion applied to (41a) but not in (41b)),
Riggle (2006) argues that an inWxal interpretation oVers a more straightfor-
ward and theoretically more restrictive analysis.10 This type of analytic
9 The shortening of long vowels is due to a productive rule of closed syllable shortening in the
language.
10 Riggle considers inWxing -C- reduplication to be the primary strategy of plural formation in
Pima. CV- reduplication only takes place when the result of C- reduplication would create illicit codas
or consonant sequences.
The secret history of inWxes 161
ambiguity is to be expected from the perspective of language change. The
changes that obscure the identity relations between the reduplicant and the
base are blind to the global consequences induced by the change. The ramiW-
cations are for subsequent learners to sort out. In the present context, whether
a reduplicative pattern should be analyzed as preWxing or inWxing is under-
determined based on the corpus available to the learner (and to the linguist).
It is often the case that only upon further changes to the language will learners
converge on a uniform analysis.
I review below a variety of scenarios that can give rise to reduplication
mutation. This presentation makes no pretense to be a comprehensive survey
of all instances of reduplication mutation. Such an exhaustive survey would
be untenable, in my view, since the eVects of sound change in a language are
invariably confounded by the phonological and morphological system of the
language. The illustrations below are meant to demonstrate the intricacies
involved in the development of an inWx under reduplication mutation. Unlike
entrapment, the shape of the resultant inWx can be quite diVerent from the
historical source. This brief survey begins with a case of reduplication with
Wxed segmentism in Trukese.
5.2.3.3 Trukese durative In Trukese, an Austronesian language spoken in
Micronesia, pluractionality is generally marked by CVC reduplication on
consonant-initial verbs, as illustrated below (Goodenough and Sugita
1980):
(42) fætæn ‘walk’ ! fæf-fætæn ‘be in the habit of walking’
mO:t ‘sit’ ! mOm-mO:t ‘be sitting’
sOtu- ‘attempt’ ! sOs-sOt ‘be sitting’
However, when the verb begins with a vowel or w (the only word-initial
glide), the inWx or preWx -Vkk-, where ‘V’ is a copy of the following vowel, is
used instead. The verb ‘drink’ illustrates an instance of the w-insertion sound
change (i.e., *inu > wīn).
(43) wīn ‘drink’ ! w-īkk-īn ‘be in the habit of drinking’
wiik ‘week’ ! w-ikk-iik ‘be for a number of weeks’
isOni ‘keep it’ ! ikk-isOni ‘be keeping it’
OsOmw
o:nu ‘pay chieXy
respects to’
! Okk-OsOmw
o:nu ‘be in the habit of paying
chieXy respects to’
This inWx is the result of the general loss of word-initial *k in durative verbs
with original initial *k (i.e., *kVk-k- > *Vkk-) (Garrett 2001; Goodenough and
Sugita 1980; Goodenough 1963).

*kakaká:su @kk@:s ‘treat as a sibling-in-law of the same sex’
*kasamw
ó:nu OsOmw
o:nu ‘pay chieXy respect to’
The reason for the *kVk-k- > *Vkk- reanalysis can be most eVectively
illustrated with a word like OsOmw
o:nu ‘pay chieXy respect to’. Historically, it
was *kasamw
ó:nu and its reduplicated form would presumably be *kak-
kasamw
ó:nu. After the dropping of the initial *k, the reduplicated form
became *ak-kasamw
ó:nu, which was then reanalyzed as *akk-asamw
ó:nu, as
*kasamw
ó:nu would have become *asamw
ó:nu. This -Vkk- preWx was then
generalized to originally vowel-initial verbs. The -Vkk- inWx did not emerge
until a subsequent change of w-insertion, however.
(45) *kóta wo:t ‘coconut-husking stick’
*ı́nu wīn ‘drink’
*kuku wī:k ‘Wngernail’
*kúru wur ‘play’
This prevocalic w-insertion process, which aVected certain vowel-initial
words, created synchronic base ! durative alternations of the pattern wV-
! wVkkV-. For example, the reduplicated form of the word wo:t ‘coconut-
husking stick’ would have been *kok-kota historically. It became *ok-kotta as a
result of initial-k dropping. The w-insertion process took place, giving rise to
*wokkotta. Since -Vkk- can be independently established based on other vowel-
initial forms that remain vowel-initial, *wokkotta was analyzed as *w-okk-otta.
Ultan (1975) takes this to be a case of entrapment. But as the above
diachronic explanation illustrated, -Vkk- was never a morpheme in
Pre-Trukese, and so the notion of entrapment does not apply here. The
emergence of the -Vkk- inWx was the result of a series of isolated develop-
ments in the phonology of Trukese that obscured the reduplicative morph-
ology of Trukese durative formation. This aspect of the development of
the -Vkk- inWx in Trukese is particularly noteworthy because it resulted in a
reduplication pattern with Wxed segmentism. As will be illustrated in the next
section, reduplication mutation may also give rise to Wxed-segment inWxes
that have lost their reduplicative characters completely.
5.2.3.4 Yurok intensive Yurok is an Algic language spoken in northwestern
California. IntensiWcation is marked by the insertion of -eg- after the onset
of the stem, including onset clusters. The orthographic ‘g’ represents
phonetically a voiced velar fricative [g]. There are no vowel-initial roots in this
language. The intensive is an event-external repetition marker that produces a

variety of meanings (e.g., frequentative with activity verbs or intensity with
verbs of experienced state; for more discussion, see Wood and Garrett 2003).

Garrett (2001) argues that the -eg- inWx arose from the reinterpretation
of historical monosyllabic Ce-reduplication. He argues that Yurok C(C)e-
intensive reduplication is a reXex of Algic C(C)e:- reduplication (47).
(47) Algic C(C)e :->Ritwan *C(C)a-> Yurok *C(C)e- (Garrett 2001: 293)
Garrett argues that the -eg- inWx has its origin in the reduplicated form of
h-initial stems. Several pieces of evidence illustrate this point. To begin with,
only *h in h-initial stems, but no other initial consonant (48), was absorbed
when combined with pronominal preWxes, creating surface forms such as
those schematized in (48c) (examples taken from Garrett 2001: 289).

c. Original h-initial stem:

Pronominal perWxes:

A subsequent intervocalic *h > g change, as partially demonstrated by the data
in (49a), yielded intensive forms that seem to be formed by -eg- inWxation (49b).
(49) a. /?o he?m/ ! ?o ge?m ‘there s/he said’ (Robins 1958: 157)

b. Original h-initial stems:

164 The secret history of inWxes
Garrett argues that it is based on these apparent inWxation patterns that the
-eg- inWx was extended to other consonant-initial stems. Some contemporary
h-initial forms still preserve the original pattern without any morphological
change (50a), while other isolated examples preserve relics of the Ce- intensive
reduplication pattern (50b) (examples taken from Garrett 2001: 293–5).

The origins of the -Vkk- durative inWx in Trukese and the -eg- inWx in Yurok
illustrate an important point. InWxes resulting from reduplicant mutation have
their origins in the obscuring of the reduplicant-base boundary. While the
sources of ambiguity may stem from quite diVerent motivations—initial-k
deletion and subsequence w-insertion in Trukese, intervocalic *h > g in
Yurok—the nature of the end eVect is comparable: the precise juncture between
the reduplicant and the base is blurred. As the original morphological analysis is
no longer readily recoverable from the data, the learner, through abductive
reasoning (Andersen 1973; Haiman 1977), develops his/her own theory of mor-
phological composition. In the present case, the inWxing analysis prevailed.
An important factor that increases the opacity between the reduplicant and
base is lexical stress. The inXuence of stress on the development of internal
reduplication has already been alluded to in the case of plural reduplication in
Hopi. Here, I consider the case of inWxal diminutive reduplication in several
North Interior Salish languages. This case study also provides an instructive
example of how prominence-driven inWxes may come about.

In the Northern Interior Salish languages, diminutives are often marked by
inWxing a copy of the pretonic consonant after the stressed vowel. In some
instances, a copy of the stressed vowel appears in the reduplicant as well.

Anderson (1996) argues that the diminutive was historically a CV preWx,
particularly since languages outside of the immediate Northern sub-branch
of the Interior Salish family have only the preWxing C(V) diminutive redupli-
cation construction.

Anderson hypothesizes that the inWxing reduplicative pattern in the North-
ern Interior Salish languages is the result of the copying of an historical

stressed reduplicative preWx that got reinterpreted as a stress-targeting
reduplication pattern. While Anderson’s analysis is reasonable, it remains
unclear how the reinterpretation might have come about. In what follows, I
show that reinterpretation toward the inWxal analysis was the result of post-
tonic vowel reduction/deletion in the Northern Interior Salish languages.
Post-tonic vowel reduction can still be observed in certain completely lexica-
lized forms (i.e., the ones where diminutive meaning is no longer transparent)
in these languages. Some examples from Lillooet are given in (56), showing
that the post-tonic vowel is reduced to a schwa (see also the discussion below
on Spokane).

Stress is morphologically governed in the Northern Interior Salish languages,
and in Interior Salish languages in general. PreWxes do not normally attract
stress. Why then was the preWxing diminutive reduplicant stress-bearing?
Based on evidence from a cognate diminutive reduplication pattern in Spo-
kane, a Southern Interior Salish language, I argue that the stress-bearing
property of the diminutive preWx is to be expected, at least prior to the
development of the inWxal pattern.
Spokane diminutive reduplication. Diminutives in Spokane are marked by
preWxing reduplication of the Wrst CVof the root and the glottalization of the
resonants in the resulting word. The data below show strong and weak CVC
roots under the diminutive construction.

11 This is likely to be a form derived from the Out-of-Control -VC reduplication, although van Eijk
does not explicitly clarify this.
168 The secret history of inWxes
Two aspects of these examples must be highlighted. The fact that the diminu-
tive preWx is stressed in the presence of a strong root but not in the weak roots
is important; it is in accordance with the rules of stress assignment in Spokane.
Stress is generally morphologically determined in Interior Salish languages.
We can distinguish between roots that are stressed in the presence of suYxes
(‘strong’ roots) and those that are unstressed in the presence of suYxes (‘weak’
roots). In Spokane, strong roots are stressed when no strong suYxes are
present (58a). Various suYxes are stressed when they occur with weak roots
or suYxes (58b), but are unstressed with both strong roots and suYxes (58a).
Weak suYxes contain no vowels and are never stressed. Weak roots are stressed
when they occur without suYxes or with weak suYxes (58c).

strong root’s domain, while weak roots are ‘post-stressing’, building a foot
starting immediately to the root’s right. However, when a weak root lacks a
vowel to its right, as in the reduplicated forms above, the default Wnal stress
obtains. As Bates and Carlson argue, the diminutive reduplicant is within the
domain of stress assignment. Another issue related to stress concerns the phe-
nomenon of vowel deletion. As illustrated in the diminutive forms of the strong
roots (57a),thereisaproductiveprocessofunstressedvowel deletioninSpokane,
which also applies to reduplicative as well as non-reduplicative forms (e.g.,

Here, I propose that the seed for inWxing reduplication can be found in the
reduplicated strong roots in Spokane. SpeciWcally, it is the reduction
of unstressed vowels that is the smoking gun. Historical CV-preWxing
diminutive reduplication (i.e., ’CiV-
p
CiVC)13 was reinterpreted as inWxing
-C- reduplication due to the absence of the root vowel (i.e., *’CiV-
p
Ci(@)C >
’
p
CiV-Ci-C). In particular, what appears to have happened is that the

The secret history of inWxes 169
reduplication pattern of weak roots has leveled toward the pattern of the strong
roots in the Northern Interior languages. The question here is why leveling
favored the strong roots’ reduplicative pattern, rather than that of the weak
roots. The answer lies in the interaction of stress and vowel deletion with double
reduplication. (59) illustrates what happens when a root undergoes
double reduplication (i.e., CV-preWxing diminutive and VC-suYxing out-of-
control reduplication). Recall that stress is on the diminutive preWx when
a strong root is reduplicated, while stress is on the weak roots itself
when diminutivized.
(59) Diminutivized out-of-control forms in Spokane (Carlson 1989: 210)
a. m’é-m’æ’-æ’ ‘A little thing got mixed by accident’
DIM-mix-OC
b. š-šl’-ı́l’ ‘Small things got all cut up’
DIM-chop-OC
As shown in (59a), stress is on the diminutive reduplicant of the strong root
/meæ’/ ‘mix’ (i.e., m’ém’l’l’), while stress is on the out-of-control suYx
following the weak root /šil/ ‘chop’ (59b) (i.e., ššlı́l’). What is of particular
interest here is that no trace of the vowel of the weak root remains in (59b),
which gives rise to a potential ambiguity in the morphological analysis of the
diminutive and the root. It is this ambiguity that serves as the pivotal context
which tilts the balance toward analyzing diminutive reduplication as inWxing.
To clarify this scenario, a schematic representation of the development of
Northern Interior Salish inWxing diminutive reduplication, particularly in the
out-of-control context, is given in below.

Diminutive reduplication in pre-Northern Interior Salish was originally
preWxing. The diminutive reduplicant was stressed in the strong roots
(Stage 1), causing the root vowel to be reduced or deleted (Stage 2), thus
170 The secret history of inWxes
creating an opaque situation in which the historical preWxing nature of the
diminutive reduplicant was no longer straightforwardly recoverable. This
opaque situation gave rise to the possibility of an inWxing analysis of diminu-
tive reduplication (Stage 3) due to the absence of the root vowel. Crucially, the
diminutive form of the weak root is consistent with the inWxing analysis.
Finally, the inWxal pattern won out over the preWxal pattern presumably due
to the paradigm uniformity eVect (e.g., mel’ ‘mix’ vs m’ém’l’ ‘DIM-mix’).
Northern Interior Salish inWxal diminutive reduplication thus emerged out
of an ambiguity in the relationship between the reduplicant and the
root introduced by the post-tonic deletion of root vowels. This case study
illustrates how a prominence-driven pattern emerges out of an original
non-stress-related preWxing reduplication. One aspect of this pattern deserves
special emphasis. Unlike the other cases reviewed, stress is the main source of
ambiguity that led to morphological reanalysis. However, the antecedent
construction itself is not prominence-driven. The association between
diminutive reduplication and stress assignment observed today is a coinci-
dence of history. To be sure, the transformation from a non-prominence-
driven pattern to a prominence-driven one is not a priori a necessary
outcome. In the case of the Northern Interior Salish languages, the promin-
ence-driven analysis prevails because not all roots contain a root vowel.
The lack of consistency in the segmental pivot might have prompted listeners
to opt for the more reliable prominence-driven analysis.
5.2.3.6 Summary This section illustrates how phonological and mor-
phological ‘erosions’ can obscure the relationship between the base
and the reduplicative aYx, which ultimately may force a reanalysis of
the morphological structure of the base+reduplicant complex. A unique
characteristic of inWxes that emerges from reduplication mutation is that the
resultant inWx not only may be unfaithful to its historical antecedent, but also
might not be reduplicative at all. This gives the impression that the resultant
inWx sprang out of nowhere. Fixed-segment inWxation that has a reduplicative
antecedent is therefore generally diYcult to detect. It is important to note that,
while reduplication mutation gives rise to Wxed-segment inWxation, Wxed-
segment inWxation does not seem to ever give rise to internal reduplication.
This asymmetry is to be expected. A Wxed-segment inWx emerges out of
reduplication due to the dissociation between the reduplicant and the base,
which results from the loss of identity between the reduplicant and base caused
by independent sound changes. On the other hand, a robust identity relation
between a Wxed-segment aYx and the stem is far less likely to obtain since the
phonological composition of the stem often does not coincide with that of
the aYx. This asymmetry may have contributed to the overwhelming number
of Wxed-segment inWxes relative to internal reduplication.
The secret history of inWxes 171
The diachronic typological survey thus far reveals that many inWxes
originate from adpositional aYxes. This coverage is of course incomplete.
Many modern-day inWxes can be traced back to historical inWxes while others
may have no historical antecedent at all. This is the topic of the next section.
5.2.4 Morphological excrescence and prosodic stem association
Many inWxes have inWxal antecedents. For example, the -um- and -in- inWxes
found in many of the Austronesian languages have been reconstructed for
Proto-Austronesian (Dahl 1976). Similarly, the -Vl- inWx in several varieties of
Chinese languages are reconstructed for Archaic Chinese as an -*r- inWx.14
Examples from Yimeng , the Chinese name of Ih Ju League, an adminis-
trative division of Inner Mongolia, and Huojia in Henan are given in (61).

14 Note that this *-r- inWx is not the historical antecedent of the retroXex lateral inWx in Pingding
and Yanggu discussed in Section 5.2.1.3 (see Yu 2004b for details).
15 Sagart notes that the glottal stop at the end of the Wrst syllable of an inWxed form is probably
inserted by the original investigators to indicate the shortness of the vowel and is not phonetically
realized in normal speech.
172 The secret history of inWxes
Since the inWxal distribution of these aYxes is inherited, I shall have little to
add in regard to the origins of these inWxes.
InWxes may also have no historical antecedent, adpositional or otherwise.
Haspelmath refers to this type of morphological creation as morphological
excrescence (Haspelmath 1995); that is, an aYx emerges in a language without
an immediately historical antecedent. For example, a set of inWxation
in Khmer, an Austro-Asiatic language, has been argued to be one such
example. The two types of inWxation patterns are nominalization (62a) and
causativization (62b).
(62) a. Nominalization (Haiman 2003: 111–12)
a. t-umn-e@k ‘connection’ < te@k ‘connect’
k-Am-hoh ‘mistake’ < khoh ‘wrong’
c-Amn-eh ‘knowledge’ < ceh ‘know’
p-umn-ool ‘recitation’ < pool ‘utter’
s-Amn-a@c ‘(a) smile’ < sa@c ‘smile’
d-Am-n@k ‘transportation’ < d@k ‘transport, lead, carry’
b. Causativization
s-Am-ru@l ‘facilitate’ < sru@l ‘easy’
t-um-le@k ‘drop’ < tle@k ‘fall’
k-Am-daw ‘heat up’ < kdaw ‘hot’
c-Am-lAA˛ ‘help s.o. cross’ < clAA˛ ‘cross (a river, etc.)’
Haiman (2003) argues that these derivational inWxes originate from mean-
ingless -Vm(n)- sequences, as evidenced by the following pairs of words that
do not have any semantic distinction.
(63) s-(Am)-ba@m ‘grand, awesome, glorious’
c-(Am)-roh ‘mixed’
c-(Amn)-ah ‘mature’
k-(om)-ruu ‘teacher’
k-(Amn)-aac ‘Werce’
t-(um)-ro@m ‘last, endure, be patient, until’
b-(Am)-ro˛ ‘ready, prepare’
On the basis of the ‘more form equals more content’ iconic markedness
principle, Haiman reasons that the speakers must have folk-etymologized
based on the assumption that there is no true synonymy. He also argues
that excrescence is plausible since inWxation is not attested in all of the
Austro-Asiatic languages (e.g., languages of the Viet-Muong subfamily do
not have inWxation). However, such comparative evidence is inconclusive.
Languages lacking inWxes today might simply reXect the loss of such
The secret history of inWxes 173
operations from changes that aVected only those languages. Semantic
bleaching and lexicalization are commonplace in language change. That
some morphologically marked forms show a lack of semantic distinction
from their unmarked counterpart is to be expected, especially with respect
to derivational morphology. Furthermore, it seems quite suspect that two sets
of grammatical morphemes should emerge from a single ejected string.
Also, as alluded to in Section 5.1, Schmidt (1906) had suggested that inWxes
in the Mon-Khmer languages are the result of entrapment. In light of these
complications, whether the inWxes in Khmer illustrate a case of morphological
excrescence shall remain to be proven. In what follows, I consider instead a
case of inWxation in English which oVers a more robust example of inWxation
out of morphological excrescence.
5.2.4.1 The emergence of Homeric inWxation Recall that Homeric inWxation
in English, involving the insertion of -ma- after a trochaic foot, is a new
construction recently introduced into Vernacular American English (a more
in-depth synchronic analysis of this pattern appears in Section 6.1 in
Chapter 6). A search on the World Wide Web resulted in the tokens shown
in (64a). The examples in (64b) were encountered in daily conversations. The
meaning of this construction indicates roughly attitudes of sarcasm and
distastefulness, although, it can also used as a form of language play.
(64) a. edu-ma-cate b. Urs(a)-ma-la
sophisti-ma-cated vio-ma-lin
syndi-ma-cated edu-ma-cate
compli-ma-cated saxo-ma-phone
lesser-edge-a-ma-cated
People who are familiar with this construction invariably credit the TV
animation series, The Simpsons1
, particularly the speech of the main char-
acter Homer Simpson, for popularizing this construction. Below are some
quotes from the animation series:
(65) Homer: Well, honey, what do you like? Tuba-ma-ba? Oba-ma-bo? That
one? Saxa-ma-phone?
Homer: A hundred bucks? For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-
ma-langelo?
This inWx is an instructive example for several reasons. First, -ma- has no
obvious historical morphological antecedent in English. An understanding of
its origin will therefore oVer a unique window into the mechanism from
which new morphological elements may emerge. As I will show further in
174 The secret history of inWxes
Chapter 6, the Homeric inWx is also a rare specimen of what I referred to as
true inWxation. The morpheme -ma- may never appear at the periphery; it
must appear internal to a morphological host (e.g., vio-ma-lin; but never
*oboe-ma, only obo-ma-boe). Since true inWxes are rare, it should be illumin-
ating to Wnd out how the origins of true inWxes diVer from other inWxes
surveyed in this chapter.
As ma-inWxation appears to be a colloquialism, it is diYcult, if not impos-
sible, to identify the earliest attestation of this construction in the history of
English. The proposal defended in this section is that -ma- emerged out of an
accidental convergence among the diVerent Wller-word constructions in Eng-
lish. By Wller-word construction, I refer to the set of vague, nonsense, Wller
words English provides when one has a hard time recalling a word, name, or
phrase to Wll the gap. A list of such words is given below (McArthur 1992):
(66) Fillers for moments of haste or forgetfulness: Put the thingummy on the
whatsit.
Phrase words based on a question: whadyamecallit, what’s-his-name/
face, whatsit, whoosis
Variants of thing: Br(itish) E(nglish) thingie, thingummy, BrE thingum-
mybob Am(erican) E(nglish) thingamabob, BrE thingummyjig AmE
thingamajig, AmE thinkumthankum, chingus, dingbat, dinglefoozie, din-
gus, ringamajiggen, ringamajizzer, majig, majigger) extensions of do:
doings, doodah/doodad, doXickety, dofunnies, doowillie, doowhistle
The theory proposed here is that ma-inWxation emerges out of the accidental
resemblance between two particular sets of these Wller words: the variants of
thing and the phrase words based on a question.
(67) a. Variant of things:
thingamabob, thingmabob, thingamajig, ringamajiggen, ringamajizzer
b. Phrase words based on a question:
Whatdyamecalli, whatchamacallit
As illustrated above, these two sets of Wller words/phrases all contain the
medial sequence -ma-. The source of this sequence is not always recoverable
from the forms themselves. At some point of the history of the English
language, some listeners who encountered these sets of words together must
have concluded that these words are all related by an inWx -ma- since they
share similar pragmatic meanings of casualness and imprecision. This inWx
-ma- was then extended to other domains to indicate the speaker’s casual
and non-committal attitude (i.e., subjectiWcation, Traugott 1989, 2004). It is a
small step to extend this usage of -ma- to indicate sarcasm.
The secret history of inWxes 175
Given this understanding of how -ma- came about, what is important to
demonstrate at this point is, Wrst, how these two sets of words are related and,
second, what the source of the sequence -ma- is in each of these sets. These
questions will be tackled in order. To begin with, the words in (67) are noun
phrases. While the internal syntax of forms in (67b) resembles that of
wh-questions in English, their external distribution shows that they behave
more like noun phrases since they are substituted for the names of either
persons or things. The forms in (67) were already used interchangeably as
early as the seventeenth/eighteenth centuries, as illustrated in the following
quotes taken from the Oxford English Dictionary.
(68) To speak of Mr. What-d’ye-call-him, or Mrs. Thingum, or How-d’ye-
call-her, is excessively awkward and ordinary.
(1741 CHESTERFIELD Let. to Son 6 Aug.)
He would answer. . . To ‘What-you-may-call-um?’ or ‘What-was-
his-name!’ But especially ‘Thingum-a-jig!’
(1876 L. CARROLL Hunting of Snark I. ix)
The quote from Lewis Carroll’s Hunting of Snark also illustrates the source of
the -ma- sequence in both whatchamacallum and thingamajig. The -ma- in
whatchimacallum comes from the word ‘may’ in ‘what you may call him’. In
contrast with whatchacallum ‘what you call him’, whatchamacallum would
appear as if there is an inserted extra syllable ma. The ma sequence in
thingumajig, on the other hand, is a reanalysis of the last consonant of the
word thingum and the excrescent vowel between thingum and the word jig.
The fact that thing and thingy exist as words in English might have prompted
some speakers to analyze thingumajig as thingy-ma-jig. This reanalysis is likely
to have been strengthened by the possible alternative pronunciation of thing-
amabob as thingmabob (thus possibly analyzed as thing-ma-bob).
Besides the semantic closeness and formal resemblance of the -ma-
sequence, the association between these two types of Wller words might have
also been facilitated by their similar stress patterns. In both whatchamacallit
and thingumabob, -ma- appears between two metrical feet (i.e., (’whatcha)
ma(callit) and (’thingu)ma(bob)). This accidental metrical convergence might
have prompted some listeners to perceive the convergence as non-accidental,
which in turn may have facilitated the extraction of the -ma- morpheme.
What is crucial here is the fact that the prominence-driven analysis is
prompted by the inability to recover the placement of a morpheme through
segmental means. That is, in whatchamacallit, roughly transcribed as
[wL(t§)tS@m@cAlit§], -ma- was Xanked by four to Wve segments to its left
and Wve segments to its right, while in thingumajig [uI˛@m@dZIg], -ma- is
176 The secret history of inWxes
Xanked by four segments to its left and three segments to its right. Thus, what
appears to the right or the left of -ma- is not constant, segmentally speaking.
However, it can be coherently characterized in metrical terms. In this case,
a syllabic trochee is identiWed as the left pivot.
5.2.4.2 Summary The ‘Homeric’ inWx emerged as the result of morphological
excrescence (Haspelmath 1995). That is, the inWx -ma- cannot be traced back
to any known historical aYxes in English. This case study thus shows
that inWxes may have non-adpositional origins, although such an inWx does
not appear to have a peripheral distribution either. The reason appears to be
that no coherent segmental pivot is identiWable in the surrounding
environment.
5.3 Conclusion
In this chapter, I have illustrated how the set of inWxation patterns may be
bounded by the forces of history. In particular, this diachronic typological
survey reveals that inWxes can often be traced back to historical adpositional
aYxes. This observation is based on diachronic investigations on genetically
and geographically diverse languages. If this observation holds up, then the
Edge-Bias EVect can be understood as a corollary of this property of inWx
development. Just as an apple never falls far from the tree, an inWx has an
edge-oriented proWle because it hails from some original adpositional loca-
tion. Thus, for example, when an adpositional aYx metathesizes as an inWx
(e.g., Lepcha transitive -j- inWxation), the resultant inWx is likely to remain
close to one edge of the stem given the fact that most cases of phonetic
metathesis are local. That is, the transposed segment remains a segment away
from its original etymological position. Even if metathesis were long distance,
the transposing segment would migrate into relatively prominent positions
(i.e., initial or stressed), never into less prominent ones (Blevins and Garrett
2005). For example, in certain South Italian dialects of Greek, prevocalic rs or
ls in a non-initial syllable have been transposed into the initial syllable.16

16 This metathesis only occurs when the liquid was positioned after an obstruent, when the initial
syllable had a prevocalic non-coronal obstruent, and when the liquid was r and the initial syllable had a
prevocalic t.

Crucially, the set of prominent positions targeted by long-distance metathesis
is within the set of potential inWxal pivots (i.e., within the initial or stressed
syllable). Thus, given that long-distance metathesis is relatively rare, inWxes
that develop from long-distance metathesis should be even more diYcult
to Wnd.
Likewise, much research on morphologization and grammaticalization
(e.g., Bybee 1985b) has shown that grammatical morphemes tend to be
small, mainly due to reduction in stress and prominence. An inWx resulting
from entrapment is unlikely to appear deep inside the stem since the preWx or
suYx that fused with the stem is unlikely to be much larger than a syllable
either. As the inWxes in the Muskogean languages illustrate, the pivots referred
to by the inWxes were themselves historical grammatical preWxes (e.g., the Wrst
vowel/syllable pivot < historical plural *ho- and applicative *a- preWxes)
and suYxes/enclitics (e.g., the Wnal syllable pivot < historical post-verbal
auxiliaries *ka, *li, *ci). Similarly, inWxes resulting from reduplication muta-
tion cannot lie far from the edges (of course, with the caveat that such inWxes
might become stress-dependent as in the case of the Northern Interior Salish
languages) since the reduplicant itself was originally adpositional; ‘mutations’
that obscure the reduplicant-stem identity take place within the reduplicant
or around the reduplicant/base boundary.
Of course, not all inWxes are edge-oriented nor must they all originate from
adpositional aYxes. As shown in this chapter, an adpositional aYx may
become prominence-driven, as in the case of Northern Interior Salish
diminutive reduplication; on the other hand, an inWx itself may have no
historical precedent at all, as in the case of Homeric inWxation. Since the
pathways to prominence-driven inWxes are far fewer than edge-oriented ones,
it is not surprising that prominence-driven inWxes are cross-linguistically far
fewer than edge-oriented ones.
As noted in Chapter 3, the goals of the diachronic and the synchronic
research programs are one and the same since the range of possible language
changes is bounded by the same constraints that hold on languages in the
synchronic sense. As such, the range of possible inWxes delineated by the Wlter
function of diachrony must be within the proper subset of all possible human
languages. Plausible inWxes or pivots may remain unattested because no
diachronic pathways lead to their creation straightforwardly. Thus, pivots
178 The secret history of inWxes
such as the ‘third vowel’ or the ‘sixth consonant’ are not found because the
diachronic scenario in which someone would treat the third vowel or the sixth
consonant as a viable pivot is vanishingly hard to obtain. Thus while the GA
formalism introduced in Chapter 3 and elaborated in detail in Chapter 4 does
not preclude the existence of such subcategorization requirements being
formulated, the formal system has no business in ruling out this possibility
a priori.17 The diachronic engine creates only a small range of possible
morphological parsing ambiguities that ultimately led to the emergence
of inWxes. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the trajectory
of change is often non-deterministic and ambiguities can often be resolved in
multiple ways. InWxation is often only one of many competing solutions.
Recall, for example, that the Muskogean languages have markers (70a) that
appear as the penultimate syllable of the verb stem, while others appear after
the Wrst vowel (70b).
(70) InWxes in Muskogean languages (Martin and Munro 2005)

impa- imhopa- ‘eat (PL)’
b. Alabama o:ti ‘make a Wre’ o:lti ‘kindling’
Chickasaw o:ti ‘kindle’ olti ‘be kindled’
These Muskogean instances exemplify not only the mechanism of entrap-
ment, but also an important aspect of the genesis of inWxes. While the
historical plural and pronominal proclitics gave rise to pre-Wnal syllable inWxes
due to the monosyllabicity of the grammaticalized auxiliary verbs, the
historical mediopassive proclitic gave rise to a post-initial vowel inWx. The
mapping from a morpheme’s historical antecedent to its synchronic distri-
bution is thus not direct. Why, then, do the Proto-Muskogean inXectional
proclitics subcategorize to their right, while the mediopassive proclitic sub-
categorizes to its left in the daughter languages? The answer to this question
brings us back to the Pivot Theory advanced in Chapter 4. Speakers may settle
on a unique solution with the assistance of inductive biases on phonological
subcategorization. Thus, while diachronic forces introduce the type of
ambiguous situation critical to the emergence of an inWx, it is these inductive
biases inherent in the morphological learning process that ultimately determine
17 The apparent non-occurrence of the ‘third syllable’ pivot might also be due to the fact that such a
pivot could be analyzed in the reverse. That is, given a language with, say, a two-disyllabic foot
minimal-word-size requirement, a potential ‘third syllable’ pivot from the left might also be analyzed
as a monosyllabic pivot on the right edge. The real question here is why languages tend to single out
pivots that are shorter than a syllabic foot. Some researchers have, for example, asserted that the
language faculty is incapable of counting higher than two.
The secret history of inWxes 179
what type of inWx might result. In particular, the factor that determines what
pivot an inWx should subcategorize for rests on the relative robustness of the
competing potential subcategorization requirements. The fact that the med-
iopassive inWx takes the initial vowel as its pivot rather than the material
following it (i.e., the historical root) has to do with the size inconsistency of
the historical roots (e.g., PM *kaxa ‘to sit (PL)’ was disyllabic but *moxoui ‘to
boil’ was trisyllabic (Booker, 2005: 252–3)). Thus, what appeared to the right
of the entrapped inWx, the historical root, was not a reliable constituent for
subcategorization. On the other hand, the material preceding the inWx was
either *a- or *ho (< *oho), which was invariably monosyllabic.
Thus, it is from this multifaceted perspective that the Edge-Bias EVect can be
fully understood. The Edge-Bias EVect is neither the consequence of the formal
grammar nor is it the accidental product of diachrony alone. While language
change creates the necessary preconditions, inWxes may only come about
given the right analytic tools (i.e., a theory of phonological/morphological
subcategorization) and principles (i.e., a theory of morphological learning).
180 The secret history of inWxes

Beyond inWxation
This last chapter is devoted to exploring some of the ramiWcations of the
phonological subcategorization approach to inWxation. To begin with, the idea
that inWxation is the result of edge misalignment raises the question: does true
inWxation exist? That is, are there inWxes that are demonstrably incapable of
appearing adpositionally? The evidence suggests the answer is positive. While
most inWxes are ‘fake’ in the sense that their subcategorization restrictions do
not call for an intrinsically intramorphemic distribution, ‘true’ inWxes do occur.
Homeric inWxation in English is a case in point and will be explored in some
detail in Section 6.1. Section 6.2 looks at how language games and disguises that
involve inWxation diVer from grammatical inWxation. I show that inWxing games
and disguises can be insightfully analyzed in terms of phonological subcategor-
ization, even in the context of iterative inWxing ludlings. Like inWxes, clitics are
said to have intramorphemic distribution in some languages. Section 6.3 reviews
two such cases of endoclisis. I argue that the propensity for endoclitics to ‘lean’
on an edge- and/or a prominence-based unit lends itself naturally to a phono-
logical subcategorization analysis. In Section 6.4, I explore the possibility of
featural subcategorization. I argue that, while features may govern allomorph
selection, they do not seem to trigger inWxation. Throughout this book, I have
defended the idea that inWxation obtains when two conditions are satisWed: (i)
when the morphological host of aYxation is larger than the size of the phono-
logical constituent subcategorized by the aYx and (ii) when the language
tolerates morpheme interruptions. While much attention has gone into illus-
trating the variety of outcomes that result when condition (i) is met, little has
been said about the eVect of condition (ii). As this book draws to a close,
I discuss in Section 6.5, albeit brieXy, other cases of phonological subcategoriza-
tion that do not result in inWxation.
6.1 Fake vs. true inWxation
A central idea argued in this work is that inWxes are nothing more than
phonological aYxes. That is, they subcategorize for phonological units rather
than morphological ones. InWxation obtains when the edge of phonological
alignment does not coincide with a morphological boundary. When the edge of
phonological subcategorization coincides with an edge of the morphological
host, the aYx in question will appear adpositionally. Not all inWxes show an
alternating distribution between inWxation and adpositional aYxation,
however. Certain subcategorization restrictions, for all intents and purposes,
preclude an adpositional realization of a phonological aYx. For example, the
intensive marker, -eg-, in Yurok will always appear after the root-initial conson-
ant(s) since roots are never vowel-initial. Thus -eg- invariably appears inWxal
because the necessary precondition for its adpositional realization is not available
(i.e., vowel-initial verbs). The source of the phonological aYx’s invariable
inWxal distribution is, therefore, external; certain properties of the language
conspire against an adpositional realization of the phonological aYx. As such,
this type of phonological aYx can be referred to as a ‘fake’ inWx. There is no
intrinsic requirement preventing the phonological aYx from appearing per-
ipherally. On the other hand, some phonological aYxes are inherently inWxal.
That is, under no circumstance can such aYxes appear adpositionally. These
are ‘true’ inWxes since they can never be realized without causing the mor-
phological host to become discontinuous. A prime example of a true inWx is
the case of Homeric inWxation introduced in the earlier chapters.
Recall that the inWx -ma- in English subcategorizes for a disyllabic trochaic foot
to its left. For example, in words which bear input stress on the Wrst and third
syllables only, the inWx, -ma-, invariably appears after the unstressed second
syllable, whether main stress is on the Wrst (1 a and b) or the third syllable (1 c
and d).

In words which are long enough to have stress on the Wrst, third and Wfth
syllables, inWx placement may vary; the inWx can follow either the second
syllable or the fourth syllable. Words with essentially the same syllable count
and stress pattern may, nonetheless, have diVerent inWxation patterns
(e.g., (2a) vs. (2b)).

The data thus far suggests that the inWx must appear to the right of a disyllabic
trochaic foot. However, as shown in (3), when the input contains a dactylic
pretonic string, -ma- does not appear as the third syllable as one would expect
if feet are strictly binary (e.g., *(mùl.ti)-ma-pli.(cá.tion)). Instead, -ma- sur-
faces as the fourth syllable. A simple post-disyllabic-trochee analysis is,
therefore, insuYcient.

Here, I analyze the ‘Homeric’ inWx as left-subcategorizing for a maximal foot.
A maximal foot must be directly dominated by a Prosodic Word. It may
dominate another foot, however. A minimal foot, on the other hand, cannot
dominate another foot. From this perspective, the third syllable of an initial
dactyl is assumed to be adjoined to the initial foot (e.g., Hayes 1982; Ito and
Mester 1992; Jensen 1993, 2000; McCarthy 1982). Words such as Tatamagou-
chee and multiplication are analyzed as in (4).

By allowing the inWx to left-subcategorize for a maximal foot, the analysis not
only captures the inWxation pattern in words like multiplication, but also
excludes unattested patterns such as *multi-ma-plication.2
1 InWxing after the initial foot, i.e., under-ma-restimate, is also possible here (i.e., repa-ma-pellent vs
repella-ma-lent), though with concomitant reduplication.
2 The main issue raised by this understanding of the prosodic organization of words like those in
(4) is that it violates the Strict Layer Hypothesis (Nespor and Vogel 1986: 7; Selkirk 1984: 26). However,
violations of the Strict Layer Hypothesis seem to be independently motivated regardless of the case
discussed here (e.g., Hayes 1982; Jensen 1993, 2000).
Beyond inWxation 183
The phonological subcategorization analysis predicts that, all else being
equal, -ma- is expected to surface after the second syllable when the input is
disyllabic. Curiously, this prediction is not borne out, as evidenced by the
ungrammaticality of following examples.
(5) oboe *oboe-ma
opus *opus-ma
party *party-ma
piggy *piggy-ma
purple *purple-ma
scramble *scramble-ma
stinky *stinky-ma
table *table-ma
In lieu of realizing -ma- as a suYx, speakers instead expand the stem in order
to accommodate the subcategorization restriction of the inWx. Two types of
expansion patterns are found. When the stressed syllable is closed, a schwa is
inserted to create a disyllabic stressed foot (6). This strategy is referred to as
schwa-epenthesis. The epenthetic schwa is underlined below.

When the Wrst syllable is open, however, a C@ syllable is inserted where the
consonant is identical to the onset of the syllable following the inWx (7). This
is a case of compensatory reduplication.

184 Beyond inWxation
The distribution of -ma- stands in stark contrast with the other inWxes
reviewed thus far. The fact that -ma- can never surface suYxally points to
the fact that the proper realization of the Homeric inWx is contingent on
its appearance as a genuine inWx in the output, that is, internal to the
transformed word. An adequate analysis of Homeric inWxation must account
for this fact. To this end, I propose the following SBM analysis.

PHON ϕ1 ( 1 )
Several aspects of this construction are noteworthy. First, the construction
takes as its input words that are already parsed metrically. That is, the source
words to ‘Homericization’ are free-standing words themselves. Consider, for
example, the word Cánada. Following the parametric approach to English
stress assignment (Hayes 1995), the main stress foot, which is trochaic, is built
from right to left. The Wnal syllable is extrametrical (e.g., (’Cana)<da>)),
which explains why main stress is on the antepenult (i.e., word-initial), rather
than on the penult. Curiously, primary stress remains initial in the inWxed
version of this word, Cána-ma-da. The preservation of initial stress would be
unexpected if stress placement occurs concomitantly with inWxation since
antepenultimate stress (e.g., Ca(ná-ma)-<da> similar to América) should
otherwise be expected. This illustration points to the fact that input
foot structure must be preserved in the output. Thus the reason one Wnds
Cána-ma-da, not *Caná-ma-da, is because the Homeric inWx takes (Cána)da
as the input. The outcome of inWxation is (Cána)-ma-da. This transderiva-
tional eVect is captured handily in (8). The lexical type Homeric word takes
the type free-stem as input. Crucially, the phonology associated with the type
free-stem (i.e., w1) is stress-assigning. The phonological output of the type free-
stem is subjected to the co-phonology of the Homeric word, abbreviated as w2,
which is stress-preserving.
Consider now the subcategorization requirements stated in (8). This
analysis states that all well-formed Homericized words must satisfy two
SubCat restrictions. As argued earlier, the ‘Homeric’ marker must take
a maximal foot as its left pivot. What remains to be explicated is the
Beyond inWxation 185
non-peripheral restriction. Here, I analyze non-peripherality as a consequence
of edge-anchoring. That is, the right edge of the source word must remain as
the right edge of the transformed word (9).
(9) Anchorio-R (a.k.a. Anchor-R)
‘The right edge of the input must coincide with the right edge of the
output.’
InWxation in polysyllabic input falls out naturally from this analysis. To
illustrate the eVect of the declarative subcategorization requirements, consider
the declarative tableau in (10). Outputs such as (10b) are banned since the right
edge of the input does not coincide with the right edge of the output.3

a.F('thεl@)-m@-("foUn)
b. ('thεl@)("foUn)-m@
Similarly, when the input is disyllabic, candidates such as (11b) where -ma-
appears suYxally are ruled out since the Wnal segment of the input fails to
appear Wnally in the output.

While expansion can be accomplished via schwa insertion when the stressed
syllable in the input is closed, when the stressed syllable is open, expansion is
realized via the duplication of the post-tonic syllable (i.e., compensatory
reduplication).
3 Unlike traditional OT tableaux, tableaux illustrating declarative evaluations have constraints that
are not crucially ranked with respect to each other (indicated by the zig-zag line) since all declarative
constraints must be satisWed by the output.

Two aspects of this analysis of non-peripherality should be emphasized. First,
the edge-anchoring analysis of non-peripherality should not be confused with
the type of OT-PR edge-avoidance analysis argued against in Chapter 2. The
subcategorization requirements of the Homeric marker are respected in all
Homeric words. No ‘movement’ of any aYx is required. Instead, the source
form is expanded so that the resulting transformed word may satisfy the two
subcategorization restrictions simultaneously. Second, non-peripherality is
an idiosyncratic and intrinsic property of the Homeric inWx. It cannot be
derived from general properties of English phonology and morphology per se.
For example, non-peripherality is not a general property of inWxation in
English; expletive formation in English allows both inWxing and ‘preWxing’
variants.
(13) fantastic fan-bloody-tastic bloody fantastic
Minnesota Minne-bloody-sota bloody Minnesota
Alabama Ala-bloody-bama bloody Alabama
Neither can non-peripherality be attributed to general rhythmic consider-
ations of English. The rhythmic pattern of the degenerate output *opus-ma
[’oUph
@sm@] (^^), for example, is identical to that of cinema [’sIn@m@]
or venomous [’vEn@m@s].
The Wnal aspect of the Homeric inWxation construction concerns the issue
of source word expansion, in particular, the treatment of compensatory
reduplication illustrated in (7). Compensatory reduplication (CR), as illus-
trated in Chapter 4, must consist of three major components: (i)
some CR-triggering factor; (ii) speciWcation of the direction of duplication;
and (iii) some way to prevent expansion by default segmental epenthesis.
Schematically, compensatory reduplication can be modeled with the follow-
ing constraint hierarchy schema (Yu 2005b):
Beyond inWxation 187
(14) CR-triggering constraint, SCORRIL/R, DepIO>> Integrity
In the present context, the CR-triggering factor is templatic (i.e., the phono-
logical subcategorization restrictions). When a CR-triggering constraint is
inviolable (or, in some cases, is ranked above the relevant FAITH constraints
(e.g., Depio, Integrity)), phonological compensation or some other form of
expansion is called for. Default segmental insertion is blocked in favor of CR
when Depio outranks Integrity (see (15); the inserted string is boldfaced;
surface corresponding segments are coindexed).4

The directionality of duplication can be handled using directional surface
correspondence constraints. The eVect of a constraint like (16) is that the
copied material must come from the syllable following, not preceding, the
inWx (17).

Finally, the fact that words like lively Homerize as [’lajv@-m@-lI], never
*[’lajvI-m@-lI] suggests that partial reduplication is not possible without the
copying of the onset consonant as well. This preference is captured by the
Surface Correspondence Percolation in (18).
4 The reduplicant does not copy the content of the inWx presumably because the IntegrityAYx
constraint is ranked above DepIO, which in turn is ranked above IntegrityStem ; it is better to allow
segments in the stem, rather than segments in the aYx, to undergo segmental Wssion.
188 Beyond inWxation
(18) Surface Correspondence Percolation
‘If syllable si contains a segment Si that is in surface correspondence
with segment Sj in syllable sj, all segments in syllable si must be in
correspondence with segments in syllable sj.’
Phonological reduplication without the copying of an onset consonant is
not possible in cases like lively because the syllable hosting any surface
corresponding segments must also be in correspondence. That is, if syllable
si contains a segment Si that is in surface correspondence with segment Sj in
syllable sj, all segments in syllable si must be in correspondence with
segments in syllable sj. Such a restriction on surface correspondence is
encoded using the theory of Prosodic Anchoring (McCarthy 2000; see also
Yip 1999 for a similar proposal). Two syllable-anchoring constraints are
posited.
(19) L-Anchors
‘The initial position of two syllables in a surface correspondence
relationship must correspond.’
R-Anchors
‘The Wnal position of two syllables in a surface correspondence
relationship must correspond.’
Below is an example of an inWxed disyllabic input.5 The analysis predicts the
reduplicant to be a CV syllable when the pivot is expanded by reduplication
since the source of the copied syllable is also CV in shape. While the copying
of the nucleus from the syllable following the inWx would be suYcient to
satisfy the disyllabic requirement of the pivot, as illustrated by (20b), such a
candidate fatally violates L-Anchors, which demands the matching of the
initial segments of the corresponding syllables.

The compliance of these two constraints is asymmetric, at least in the case of
Homeric inWxation (i.e., L-Anchors must dominate R-Anchors) since no
reduplication is possible when the initial syllable is closed. For example, (21a)

is ruled out by virtue of the fact that the onsets of the corresponding syllables
do not match. The syllables before and after the inWx in (21a) are in corres-
pondence due to the fact that the reduplicative vowel is in a correspondence
relationship with the Wnal vowel. (21b) prevails even though it contains
an epenthetic schwa. The syllables before and after the inWx are not in
correspondence in this candidate since none of the segments of the respective

There are various complications to the patterns of Homeric inWxation
that will remain unexplored here (see Yu, 2003, 2004b; 2005b for further
explications). The main goal of this section is to argue for the distinction
between fake and true inWxes and how their diVerences may be captured.
True inWxes are essentially phonological aYxes that have an additional
non-peripheral requirement. It should be noted that strict non-peripheral
distribution does not appear to be a strong characteristic of grammatical
aYxes. This state of aVairs is no doubt a reXection of the adpositional origin
of inWxes. That is, since inWxes generally originate from previous preWxes and
suYxes, it is not surprising that they might betray their etymological adposi-
tional distribution under the appropriate circumstances. On the other hand,
as seen in the last chapter, the Homeric inWx, a true inWx, originates word-
internally. The lack of evidence for its peripheral distribution might have
prompted speakers to be less inclined to realize it peripherally. In the next
section, I consider the types of inWxation found in language games and
disguises. Unlike grammatical inWxes, inWxal language games and disguises
often impose strict non-peripherality requirements.
6.2 InWxation in language games and disguises
Language games and disguises (also known as ludlings) may come in various
diVerent forms. Bagemihl (1988) identiWes three types of ludlings in
the world’s languages: templatic, reversing, and inWxing. I shall focus on the
6 L-ANCHORs and R-ANCHORs must dominate DepIO since default schwa insertion is allowed
when CR is not possible.
190 Beyond inWxation
inWxing ludlings here, which generally involve the insertion of a fully or
partially speciWed sequence of segments into the string of some source forms.
The epenthetic material resembles an inWxing morpheme but is semantically
void. For example, in Estonian, a Finno-Ugric language, one word game involves
the insertion of a syllable /pi/ after the Wrst vowel of the word.

As the examples in (22b) illustrate, the inWx is left-subcategorizing for the Wrst
vowel (which I analyzed here as the Wrst mora), rather the Wrst syllable. Thus
when the Wrst syllable contains a diphthong, the inWx appears between the two
elements of the diphthong. The Wrst-mora-pivot analysis is further supported by
the behavior of the inWx when the Wrst syllable of the source word contains a long
vowel. As is well known, Estonian has three degrees of quantity: Q1 (short), Q2
(long), Q3 (overlong). When the Wrst syllable of the stem begins with a long
vowel or an overlong vowel, the long vowel in the Wrst syllable is realized as short
in the inWxed word and the vowel of the inWx surfaces as long (23).

This distribution of vowel length is to be expected if the distribution of the
inWx is stated at the moraic level. That is, if the left edge of the inWx must align
with the right edge of the Wrst mora, then the original second mora in the
source word is displaced to the second syllable, which coincides with

InWxing ludlings also often impose additional prosodic requirements on the
output. For example, Prokem is a slang adopted by teenagers and students,
mostly in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia.

As illustrated by the examples above, in this language disguise, the Wnal rhyme
of a source word is truncated and the inWx -ok- is inserted before the Wnal
vowel of the truncatum (Slone 2003).
6.2.1 Iterative inWxal ludling
One feature that distinguishes inWxing ludling from grammatical inWxation is
that inWxes in word games may sometimes apply iteratively. That is, the
inserted string is found in multiple locations within the source word. Iterative
inWxing of the same morph is not found in grammatical inWxation. Take, for
example, a set of ludlings found in Tigrinya. In this language, there are two
play languages, both involve the insertion of -gV- after each vowel, where V is
a copy of the preceding vowel. The two play languages have diVerent output
requirements, however.

In Play Language 1, word-internal consonant clusters are left intact. Unlike
Play Language 1, all closed syllables in the source words are eliminated via
the insertion of ı̈ in Play Language 2 and the inWx may appear after the
inserted ı̈.7
A similar game is found in Tagalog where the sequence -gVVdV- is inserted
after the nucleus of each syllable. The unspeciWed vowels of the inWx copy the
vocalism of the preceding syllable (Conklin 1956, 1959).

192 Beyond inWxation
Several approaches to iterative inWxation are available within a constraint-based
framework. Iterative inWxation can be analyzed as a reversal in the quantiWca-
tion relation between aligning elements. Recall that the arguments in a
Generalized Alignment constraint are bound by diVerent quantiWers. The
Wrst argument is within the scope of a universal quantiWer, while the second
argument is bound by an existential quantiWer. When the inWxal materials
occupy the universal-quantiWed argument, the resulting alignment constraint
can be satisWed whenever there is at least one appearance of the inWxal
string in the proper location in the output. While such a constraint does
not ban multiple realization of the inWx a priori, iterative inWxation is not
expected to occur without additional motivations (see below). However,
when a phonological pivot occupies the universally quantiWed argument
and the inWxal morph occupies the existential-quantiWed argument, iterative
inWxation is predicted. For example, the play languages in Tigrinya can be
analyzed as follows:
(28) play-lg-word
PHON ϕ( 1 , 2 -gV-)
SUBCAT ALIGN(µH,R, 2 ,L)
|
Stem
PHON 1
Ignoring for the moment the analysis of the vocalic element in the inWx, the
constraint in (28) says that every head mora of a source syllable must be
followed by the sequence -gV-. As illustrated in Play Language 1, the inWx
must be analyzed as appearing after the nucleus (29) which is the head of the
syllable. The inWx does not appear after a moraic coda since codas cannot be
the head of a syllable (e.g., k’ar.ma ! *k’agargamaga). In Play Language 2,
moraic codas in the input may be followed by an inWx, but only if a vowel is
inserted. Thus, moraic codas are eliminated as a result of vowel epenthesis.
As illustrated in (29), the alignment restriction in (28) is satisWed since each
input head mora is followed by an inWx.

The diVerence between Play Language 1 and Play Language 2 is that, in Play
Language 2, the source word may be expanded in order to avoid surface codas,
while Play Language 1 has no such restriction. Crucially, the number of inWxes
that show up in the output is limited only by the number of head moras there
are in the source word.
While iterativity in inWxing ludling can be analyzed in terms of a reversal of
quantiWcational relation between aligning elements, such an analysis runs into
troubles when iterativity is accompanied by non-peripherality. The hábà?ábà
game in Hausa oVers an instructive illustration of this problem. In this game,
-bV- is inserted after the head mora of a syllable (i.e., the nucleus), regardless of
whether or not that vowel is followed by a coda consonant (30a). Like the other
inWxing ludlings introduced thus far, the vowel of the inWx is a copy of the
preceding vowel. What distinguishes the hábà?ábà game from the other
iterative inWxing ludlings mentioned above is that the inWx can never appear
after the Wnal vowel of the source word, that is, the inWx can never appear at the
periphery. Thus when the source word is monosyllabic, for example, the inWx
appears internal to the reduplicated version of the source word (30b).

This non-peripheral restriction is problematic since a subcategorization
requirement like (28) states that ALL head moras are followed by an inWx.
As subcategorization requirements are stated declaratively within the present
framework and are thus inviolable, the inability of the ludling inWx to appear
after the Wnal vowel is contrary to the spirit of a declarative analysis of aYx
placement. To this end, Piñeros’s (1998) subcategorizationless approach to
iterative inWxation provides an intriguing alternative.
Based on a set of Jerigonza word games in various dialects of Spanish,
Piñeros (1998) argues that iterative inWxing ludling should not be analyzed as
inWxation at all. The inserted syllables are treated as a matter of phonological
epenthesis while iterativity is motivated by output prosodic requirements.
Before diving into the speciWcs of Piñeros’s analysis, let us Wrst consider the
Spanish Jerigonza data. Examples of the Jerigonza word game are given in (31).
194 Beyond inWxation
In the Peruvian Spanish version of this game, cha- is ‘preWxed’ to every syllable
of the source word. In the Colombian version, -pV- appears after every syllable
of the word. In the Costa Rican version, however, -pV- appears to the right of
every head of the syllable, separating the coda from its source syllable aYliation.
Crucially, the outputs of Jerigonza always have an alternating stress pattern
where every syllable of the source word carries either primary or secondary
stress; the contrastive stress pattern of the source word is neutralized.

Piñeros (1998) analyzes the distribution of the inserted string as the result of
prosodic faithfulness constraint interaction. Armed with the assumption that
inputs to word games are well-formed words (i.e., syllabiWed), Piñeros proposes
that the edges of each input syllable must align with some output foot (32). On
the other hand, feet must be binary at the syllabic level in Jerigonza. Thus, in
order to satisfy syllable edge alignment and the binary syllabic feet requirement
simultaneously, the source words are expanded by way of the inserted string. For
example, in (33), when the foot binarity requirement dominates Anchor(s)R,
candidates with monosyllabic feet will lose invariably (see (33b and c)).
(32) Anchor(s)L
‘The leftmost element of a syllable in the source form corresponds to
the leftmost element of a foot in the output.’

‘The rightmost element of a syllable in the source form corresponds to
the rightmost element of a foot in the output.’

‘All feet are binary at the syllabic level.’

Piñeros’s analysis oVers a straightforward explanation for the diVerence in the
behavior of codas in the Colombian and Costa Rican versions of Jerigonza.
Under his analysis, the distribution of the inserted CV string is not governed
by any subcategorization requirements; in fact, the inserted CV is not treated
as a morphological entity at all. Rather, it is the result of default consonant
epenthesis and compensatory rhyme reduplication. I shall come back to this
point in due course. Let us Wrst look at how the constraints in (32) account for
the diVerent inWxal locations found in the diVerent Spanish dialects.
In Colombian Jerigonza, since Anchor(s)L outranks Dep-s, the inserted
syllable (shown as -PV- in the tableau) must appear to the right of a source
syllable. As foot binarity is always obeyed in all Jerigonza-transformed words,
the FtBin constraint (and the candidates that violate this constraint) will be
left out in the subsequent tableaux to simply the presentation.

Crucially, when both Anchor(s)L and Anchor(s)R outrank Dep-s, -PV- is
sandwiched, as it were, between parts of the input syllable, as found in Costa
Rican Jerigonza, because the peripheral segments of the input syllable must
also coincide with the peripheries of the output foot.

The segmental content of the inserted string, under Piñeros’s analysis, is a
matter of the emergence of the unmarked (J. McCarthy and Prince 1994a).
The vocalic content of the inserted syllable is the result of compensatory
reduplication (cf. Yip 1999). That is, rather than epenthesizing a default vowel
to satisfy the disyllabic foot requirement, Jerigonza prefers the duplication of
the nucleus of the source syllable. As shown in (37), default vowel insertion is
prohibited because Dep-V is ranked above Integrity. It is therefore better to
introduce a copied vowel than to insert a new segment.

Since Onset, a constraint requiring all syllables to begin with a consonant,
dominates Dep-C, an onset consonant must also be introduced to accompany
the copied vowel. Integrity must dominate Dep-C since the inserted onset is
a Wxed segment, rather than a duplicate of the onset of the preceding syllable.
The actual phonological content of the inserted onset is governed by
the relative ranking between the constraint Onset and a set of segmental
markedness constraints. Crucially, when Onset ranks above the markedness
constraint against labial stops but below the markedness constraints for all
other types of segments at syllable margins (abbreviated as *M/C¼:p in
(38) ), p emerges as the ‘default’ epenthetic consonant.

In sum, Piñeros has advanced two proposals. First, he argues that iterative
‘inWxing’ ludling is motivated by prosodic restriction on output structures.
Second, the inserted materials should be accounted for by way of phonological
epenthesis and compensatory reduplication. As such, the inserted materials are
treated as entirely phonologically derived and thus have no lexical entry or
subcategorization restrictions. If this compensatory reduplication approach is
proven correct, iterative ‘inWxing’ ludling is not a case of inWxation at all since
the inserted string has no inherent content. Theyare merely introduced to satisfy
output prosodic requirements of the game (e.g., foot binarity and source syllable
anchoring). Since no subcategorization restriction is posited in association with
the inserted string, the non-peripheral distribution of the inserted string can be
handled easily by assuming that the input-output edge-anchoring constraints
are highly ranked, similar to the approach taken in the analysis of Homeric
inWxation above. This emergent approach to iterative inWxing ludling makes a
strong, but fatal, prediction, however. That is, the inserted string is predicted to
be either phonologically unmarked or is some duplicate of elements already
in the source word. That is, iterative inWxing ludling cannot involve the insertion
of a polysyllabic string and the inserted string can never contain diVerent
non-reduplicated materials or syllable structures. As demonstrated by the
examples in (39), this prediction is easily falsiWed, however (cf. McCarthy
1991). For example, the insertion of a -ppV- string in Cuna is unexpected
under the emergent view of iterative inWxing ludling since it seems highly
unlikely that a geminate -pp- should be the unmarked consonant in the lan-
guage. Worse yet are examples like Cyprus Greek (39d) and Latvian (39e) where
the inserted strings in both cases contain consonants of wildly diVerent place
and manner of articulations. In particular, in the Cyprus Greek case, the inserted
string contains both open and closed syllables.

In this section, I reviewed two approaches of iterative inWxing ludling.
The reverse-quantiWcation approach predicts iterative aYxation of ludling
materials but it fails to accommodate the possibility of non-peripherality.
The emergent approach to inWxing ludling proposed by Piñeros, on the other
hand, denies such ludlings as ‘inWxing’ at all; iterative ‘inWxing’ ludling is
treated as an instance of phonological epenthesis. While such an approach
appears to work well for iterative inWxing of CV syllables, it oVers no recourse
when the inserted material is internally heterogeneous (e.g., containing
consonants of diVerent places of articulation and syllables of diVerent struc-
tures). In the next section, I advance a generalized theory of iterative
inWxation. It combines the strengths of the subcategorization approach and
Piñeros’s prosodic interpretation of iterative inWxation.
6.2.2 A general theory of iterative inWxing ludling
The theory of iterative ludling inWxation advanced here has two main
features. First, the treatment of iterative inWxing ludlings is formally no
diVerent from non-iterative inWxing ludlings. All inWxing ludlings have
subcategorization requirements similar to those of other phonological
aYxes. Second, the inWxal construction itself imposes strict output prosodic
8 Alidou (1997: 46) notes that the behavior of vowel length in this game is not predictable. Certain
game forms show lengthening of the original non-Wnal short vowels, while others do not. Some
examples also show shortening of original non-Wnal long vowels in the derived words.
Beyond inWxation 199
restrictions on the transformed word. Thus, for example, I propose that the
Hausa hábà?ábà game involves the insertion of -b-, which is left-subcategorizing
for a head mora of a foot (i.e., Align(-b-,L,mh,R)). (I shall return to the issue of
the copied vowel in due course.) Unlike other inWxation patterns, the hábà?ábà
game imposes prosodic well-formedness restrictions on the transformed words.
SpeciWcally, outputs of the hábà?ábà game must be parsed into disyllabic
trochaic tonal feet. Since the head of a tonal foot in Hausa must carry a high
tone (cf. Leben 2001), syllables inherited from the source words are invariably
associated with a high tone on the surface, while the inserted -bV-, which
occupied the weak position of a tonal foot, always carries a low tone. Leaving
aside the issue of tonal assignment, the proper footing of a transformed word is
formalized in terms of the constraints in (40) (see also (32)). Note that all long
monophthongs are shortened in this game, including the last, presumably due
to the eVect of an undominated *LongVowel constraint.
(40) Anchor(s)L
‘The leftmost element of a syllable in the source form corresponds to
the leftmost element of a foot in the output.’
Anchor(s)R
‘The rightmost element of a syllable in the source form corresponds to
the rightmost element of a foot in the output.’

‘All feet are binary at the syllabic level.’

Assuming that -bV- must be present in the transformed word (presumably the
result of an undominated Realize-Morph constraint (cf. Kurisu 2001)), as
illustrated in tableau (41), a well-formed foot in the output candidate must
be headed by materials from the source word, otherwise, the candidate
200 Beyond inWxation
(i.e., (41b)) will fatally violate Anch(s)L. Inserting -bV- after the coda
consonant of the source word syllable will fatally violate Anch(s)R
(i.e., (41c)).9 As shown by the failing candidate in (41d), not every syllable
of the source word is parsed. In particular, the Wnal syllable cannot be parsed
into its own foot since it will fatally violate FootBinarity. The analysis in
(41) is curiously incomplete, however, since it fails to predict the correct
output candidate. That is, candidate (41e) is more well-formed than the
attested output (41a) because (41e) left no syllable unparsed on the surface.
Note that (41e) satisWes Anch(s)R since the rightmost segment of this
candidate (i.e., the nucleus of the inserted -bV-) stands in correspondence
with the rightmost segment of the source word. This correspondence relation
is licensed by the fact that the nucleus of the inserted -bV- is epenthesized via
the mechanism of compensatory reduplication. As shown in the diagram in
(42), the Wnal vowel i stands in surface correspondence with the preceding
vowel, which in turns stands in correspondeance with the Wnal vowel of the
source word. By transitivity, the Wnal i in the output stands in correspondence
with the Wnal vowel of the source word as well. As such, Anch(s)R is satisWed
in (41e) since the rightmost element of the Wnal foot stands in correspondence
with the rightmost element of the Wnal syllable of the source word.
(42) Source: m ai s k ij
Transformed: m ai bk ai s k ij bk ij
Ultimately, the reason why candidate (41e) is undesirable has to do with the
fact that the hábà?ábà game imposes a non-peripherality requirement on all
transformed outputs. Such a non-peripheral restriction is not an intrinsic
property of iterative inWxing ludling, even in Hausa. The ?ásàdásà game in
Hausa inserts -sV- after each source syllable, for example. Unlike the
hábà?ábà game, however, -sV- can appear word-Wnally. Non-Wnality is, there-
fore, not an intrinsic property of iterative inWxing ludlings per se, but rather
a feature that must be stipulated for a particular game. In the ?ásàdásà game,
for example, a candidate like (41e) would be the desired winner.

9 If the coda consonant is moraic, then such a candidate will be ruled out independently due to its
failure to conform to the subcategorization requirement (i.e., -bV- left-subcategorizes for the head
mora of a foot, which corresponds to the nucleus of a source syllable).

Returning to the analysis in (41), what diVerentiates (41a) from (41e) is the
fact that (41e) violates the non-peripheral requirement but (41a) does not.
Earlier, in the context of Homeric inWxation, I suggested that the non-
peripheral restriction is captured by the Anchorio-R constraint. This con-
straint requires the right edge of the source word to coincide with the right
edge of the transformed output. Candidates such as (41e) show that such a
parochial Anchor constraint is insuYcient in the present context since the
Wnal segment of the source word is indeed in correspondence with the Wnal
segment of the output, albeit via the mechanism of compensatory reduplica-
tion. A more reWned notion of anchoring is needed. Here, I adopt the notion
of Strong-Anchor (Ussishkin 1999).The idea behind Strong-Anchor is
that relations between Strong-Anchor-ed segments must be unique. That
is, no segments regulated by Strong-Anchor can have exponents elsewhere in
the output. While Strong-Anchor mimics the eVect of Integrity, it is more
restrictive than Integrity since Strong-Anchor localizes its ban to
just segmental Wssion. Given a constraint like (44), the previously problematic
candidate is duly eliminated (see (45b)). It should be noted that since
non-peripherality is an intrinsic property of the hábà?ábà game, the
Strong-Anchor requirement is stated as part of the declarative component
of the construction. The declarative tableau evaluation in (45) reXects this point.

ALIGN(-bV-,L,µH,R)
(46) summarizes my analysis of the hábà?ábà game thus far. This construc-
tion states that -b- must appear to the right of some head mora of a syllable
and that the right edge of the transformed output must uniquely correspond
to the right edge of the source word. Crucially, nowhere in the analysis is
iterative insertion of the -b- inWx required. Rather, iterative inWxation falls
out as a by-product of the output prosodic requirements, as Piñeros argued
202 Beyond inWxation
(i.e., output foot binarity and input-output syllable edge alignment).
Note also that the inserted material is assumed to be a mere consonant, -b-.
The vocalism that accompanies the inserted -b- is derived from the output
prosodic requirements (e.g., FtBin is satisWed via compensatory vocalic
reduplication). I will focus on this aspect of the analysis for the remainder
of this section.

Since the co-phonology of the hábà?ábà game calls for input-output prosodic
correspondence, to minimize such prosodic anchoring violations, a certain
strategy is employed to guarantee output foot well-formedness. To under-
stand this, it is best to illustrate the idea with a concrete example. Consider the
evaluation in (47).

The source word contains three input syllables (i.e., mài.mú.nà). In order to
maximize the number of footed syllables, every non-Wnal syllable may serve as
the head of a foot. Candidates with more than one unparsed syllable
(e.g., (47c)) are automatically ruled out by the excessive violations of
Parse-s relative to the winning candidate. Yet, since FootBinarity is undo-
minated, an input syllable cannot form its own foot, as illustrated by the
failure of (47d). Instead, disyllabic feet are made possible via the duplication
of the nucleus of the source syllable. (The inWx -b- is duplicated to supply an
onset for the inserted nucleus. See below for more discussion.)
Beyond inWxation 203
(48) Source: m aii m uj n a
Transformed: m aii bk aii m uj bk uj n a
To be sure, this expansion is not motivated by the subcategorization require-
ment of -b- per se. As shown in (47b), the subcategorization of -b- is fulWlled
as long as there is one instantiation of -b- in the output. Nothing in
the construction in (46) requires -b- to be present after every head mora.
However, when it does appear in the output, every instance of -b- is subject
to the same subcategorization requirement. A candidate like *(máibài)(bù-
mú)ná would not only violate Anchor(s)L since the second foot is not
headed by a syllable corresponding to a source syllable, but would also violate
the distributional restriction of -b- imposed by the game since the second
instance of -b- does not follow a head mora (recall that the head mora is to be
understood as the head mora of the head syllable of a foot).
One question that remains to be addressed is why disyllabic-foot-well-
formedness is satisWed via compensatory reduplication. Recall that compensa-
tory reduplication is motivated by the constraint-ranking schema, DepIO >>
Integrity. As illustrated in (49), expansion via non-reduplicative epenthesis
(see (49b)) is ruled out due to the high ranking of DepIO. What remains unclear
is why candidates like (49c) are impossible. As noted above, the construction in
(46) imposes no requirement of iterative insertion of -b-. Thus as long as -b- is
properly realized somewhere in the output, it is unclear why foot expansion
elsewhere in the transformed word cannot be realized through the full copying
of the immediately preceding syllable (i.e., (49c)). This is especially curious since
the rhyme of the inserted syllable is a direct copy of the rhyme of the preceding
syllable anyway; it seems to be a natural step to copy the onset consonant as well.

DEP-SEG INTEGRITY
Onset copying is prevented due to the high ranking of the constraint in (50).
This constraint states that if the leftmost element of an input syllable corres-
ponds with the leftmost element of a foot in the output, the corresponding
204 Beyond inWxation
output element must be unique. Thus as shown in (51), a candidate with onset
copying from the immediately preceding syllable (51b) is undesirable since the
onset of the preceding syllable always stands in a prosodic anchoring relation
with a source syllable. On the other hand, duplicating -b- does not violate
S-Anchor since -b- has no syllable aYliation in the input at all.

DEP-SEG S-ANCHOR(σ)L INTEGRITY
The main goal of this discussion is to highlight the fact that iterative inWxing
ludling can be accounted for using the same mechanism already proposed in
this work. The theory advanced in this section provides the necessarily
framework for understanding iterative inWxing ludlings in general. Crucially,
the present treatment of iterative inWxing ludling is, at its core, no diVerent
from treatments of other phonological aYxes argued throughout this work.
The inWx in question is subcategorizing for a moraic pivot. The multiple
appearances of the inWx in the output are the by-product of other prosodic
requirements independently imposed by the game. Iterative inWxation is
the result of compensatory reduplication.
Iterativity, I suspect, is impossible as a stand-alone feature of any linguistic
phenomenon unmotivated by prosodic or rhythmic factors. Rhythmicity may
also be a strategy to reduce the cognitive burden of processing disguised
words in inWxing ludling. This proposal is motivated by the obser-
vation that iterative ludling inWxation appears to correlate with a reduction
of phonological complexity. That is, outputs of iterative inWxing ludling often
carry less contrastive information than their source word counterparts.
For example, the Hausa hábà?ábà game not only requires the insertion of
-bV- after the nucleus of each non-Wnal syllable in the source word, long
monophthongal vowels in the source word are also shortened as a result of
inWxing ludling. The vowel length contrast in Hausa is, therefore, suspended
in the transformed word. More important is the fact that the tonal pattern of
Beyond inWxation 205
the source word is ignored in favor of an alternating high-low tone pattern
such that the high tones always fall on syllables of the source word. Contrast-
ive tonal information in the source words is therefore suspended as well in
favor of a predictable alternating tone pattern. The dispreference for direct
onset copying illustrated in (51) might also be a reXection of this facilitative
disposition of iterative inWxing ludling. That is, if the inserted syllable is a full
copy of its preceding syllable, recovery of the source word might be hindered
by the need to factor out duplicated materials at every turn. The insertion of a
Wxed consonant, on the other hand, provides a level of contrast between
the inherited source word materials and the extraneous inserted materials.
In particular, the inserted consonant functions as the onset. It not only
demarcates the boundary of the inserted syllable, but it might also serve as
an invitation to the listener to ignore the content of that syllable. Note that
such complexity reduction is, however, characteristic of iterative inWxing
ludlings only, not of inWxing ludlings in general. Complexity reduction
might therefore be a strategy to reduce the processing costs of severely
disguised words. Obviously, this claim about the complexity reduction aspect
of iterative inWxing ludling must be tested against a larger corpus of iterative
inWxing ludling games. More research on ludlings in general is in fact needed.
For example, just exactly how are diphthongs and long vowels treated in
iterative inWxing ludling? In Hausa, for example, there appears to be much
variation in the treatment of diphthongs and long vowels. Some games treat
diphthongs on the par as monophthongs but as long vowels in other games.
The issue of tonal assignment must also be examined in more detail. Again, in
Hausa, some games retain the tonal pattern of the source word, but others
prefer to impose their own tonal patterns.
In the next section, I turn to a phenomenon that closely resembles
inWxation—endoclisis. I brieXy consider how the theory of phonological
subcategorization may be extended to accommodate endocriticized words.
6.3 Endoclisis
Clitics can be broadly deWned as a class of linguistic units that are phonolo-
gically dependent on some other prosodically independent units. Following
the diagnostic conditions laid out in Zwicky and Pullum (1983), clitics must
satisfy the majority, if not all, of the following criteria:
(52) A. Clitics can exhibit a low degree of selection with respect to their
hosts, while aYxes exhibit a high degree of selection with respect to
their stems.
206 Beyond inWxation
B. Arbitrary gaps in the set of combinations are more characteristic of
aYxed words than of clitic groups.
C. Morphological idiosyncrasies are more characteristic of aYxed
words than of clitic groups.
D. Semantic idiosyncrasies are more characteristic of aYxed words
than of clitic groups.
E. Syntactic rules can aVect aYxed words, but cannot aVect clitic
groups.
F. Clitics can attach to material already containing clitics, but aYxes
cannot.
An intriguing aspect of clitics is that they often appear in places that seem
to create apparent discontinuities. Consider the following examples from
Serbo-Croatian (data taken from Anderson 2000: 308):
(53) a. Moja ¼će mladja sestra doći u utorak
my FUT younger sister come on Tuesday
‘My younger sister will come on Tuesday’
b. Moja mladja sestra ¼će doći u utorak
My younger sister FUT come on Tuesday
‘My younger sister will come on Tuesday’
c. Lav ¼je Tolstoi veliki ruski pisac
Leo is Tolstoy great Russian writer
‘Leo Tolstoy is a great Russian writer’
d. Lav Tolstoi ¼je veliki ruski pisac
Leo Tolstoy is great Russian writer
‘Leo Tolstoy is a great Russian writer’
The clitics, shown in boldface, are instances of the so-called second-position
clitics, which generally appear after an initial syntactic constituent. The point
of interest here is that, at least for some speakers, these clitics may appear after
the initial word irrespective of constituent unity. For example, the clitic ¼je in
(53c) intrudes within the proper name Leo Tolstoy. The ability for certain
clitics to create discontinuity extends beyond the syntactic domain. Some
clitics may even disrupt the integrity of a lexical word. This section focuses on
these so-called endoclitics.
The treatment of clitics varies from being purely syntactically driven
to purely phonologically driven. Anderson (2005), who presents the most
comprehensive study of the linguistic properties of clitics to date, argues for
the view that the nature of clitics is essentially morphological. That is, clitics
Beyond inWxation 207
are phrasal aYxes. An important argument for the morphological nature of
clitics is its parallelism with regular aYxation. SpeciWcally, he observes that,
not only are there preWxing and suYxing counterparts of aYxation in clitics,
but that inWxation of a clitic is also possible. That is, like inWxes which create
discontinuity in their morphological hosts, several languages have been
reported to have clitics that show intramorphemic distribution. I review
two such cases in this section.
6.3.1 Udi
In the most extensive and convincing study of endoclisis to date, Harris
(2002) reports that, in Udi, a Lezgic language of the Nakh-Daghestanian
family, there is a set of person-marking clitics (PM) that show agreement
with the subject of a clause. The choice of the allomorphs of a given PM form
is entirely phonologically governed.

Under certain speciWc tense/aspect categories and focus construction, these
markers are encliticized to the verb. In other context, however, the distribu-
tion of these clitics is more complicated. In most TAM categories (present,
imperfect, aorist I, aorist II, perfect, particle conditional, future I, conditional
I) PMs appear in a complex verb stem, occurring between the so-called
incorporate category and the light verb. (In (55), the incorporate category
immediately precedes the (bold) PM clitic, while the light verb is italicized.)

208 Beyond inWxation
When the verb is monomorphemic, however, the PM appears immediately
before the Wnal consonant of the verb (56). In the examples below, the root is
given Wrst, followed by the endocliticized example (Harris 2000: 598–9).

‘[Once upon a time, there] is a person like a king.’
To be sure, the distribution of the endoclitic PM cannot be phonologically
conditioned. For example, whether a PM is inWxed to a monomorphemic
verb root is determined by the transitivity of the stem (Crysmann 2000;
Harris 1997, 2002). When the verb is transitive, PMs are inserted before the
Wnal consonant of the (underlined) verb root. On the other hand, when a verb
is intransitive, PMs are encliticized.
(57) Distribution of PMs in transitive and intransitive verbs (Harris 2002: 127)

The distribution of PM is considerably more complicated, however. Harris
observes that the placement of PM may be aVected by ‘(a) speciWc TAM
categories (future II, subjunctive I and II, imperative), (b) syntactic notions,
including [focused constituents] and predicate nominals, (c) incorporated
status of a morpheme, (d) speciWc lexical stems . . . , (e) the phonological
structure of verb stems (i.e., the position before the last consonant of the
Beyond inWxation 209
stem)’ (Harris 2002: 143). The exact conditions under which these various
factors come into play with the placement of PM are summarized in (58).
(58) Rules for Udi PM placement (reproduced from Harris
2002: 130)
Rule 1. PMs are Wnal in the Vx if the verb is in the future II, subjective
I, the subjunctive II, or the imperative.10
Rule 2. PMs occur enclitic to a focused constituent.
a. PMs occur enclitic to a negative particle.
b. PMs occur enclitic to a questioned constituent.
c. PMs occur enclitic to other focused constituents.
Rule 3. In clauses with zero copulas, PMs are enclitic to predicate
nominals.
Rule 4. PMs are enclitic in a complex verbstem, occurring between
the IncE and the light verb or verb root.
a. In a productive causative, PMs occur between the inWnite
(in -es) and the light verb. In the archaic causative, PMs occur
between the-ev aYx and the light verb or the verb root.
b. PMs occur between the IncE (noun, adjective, adverb,
simplex verb stem, borrowed verb, unidentiWed element, or
locative preverb) and the light verb or verb root.
Rule 5. For verb stems of class M, in the intransitive, PMs are endoc-
litic, occurring between the verb stem and the present-tense
marker.
Rule 6. With verb forms of category A and category B, PMs are
enclitic to the entire verb form.
a. Category A consists of verb forms with a stem (or an
allomorph of a stem) consisting entirely of a single consonant
or a CV sequence.
b. Category B consists of irregular forms of other verbs: aba-
za ‘I know’, ex-ne ‘she says’, p’ur-e-ne ‘he died’, č’e-re-ne ‘she
went out’, a-re-ne ‘she came’, and ci-re-ne ‘she went down’
Rule 7. PMs are endocliticized immediately before the Wnal conson-
ant in monomorphemic verb roots.
In order to capture the fact that the PM placement rules are prioritized
(i.e., Rule 1 takes precedence over Rule 2, Rule 3 takes precedence over
Rule 4, etc.), Harris formalizes these placement restrictions within the
framework of Optimality Theory. The analysis is summarized below:
10 ‘Vx’ refers to the complex consisting of the verb and the negative. ‘IncE’ refers to Incorporated
elements;
210 Beyond inWxation
(59) Align-PM-al/-a>>Align-PM-FocC>>Align-PM-IncE>>Align-PM-
Verbstem
I shall not reproduce Harris’s detailed analysis here. Interested readers should
consult that work directly. SuYce to say that Rule 1 is captured by the Align-
PM-al/-a constraint, while Rule 2 is captured by Align-PM-FocC. Rule 4 and
Rule 5 are subsumed by Align-PM-IncE, while Rule 7 is captured by Align-PM-
Verbstem. What is of particular interest here is that these alignment con-
straints are suppletive constraints in the sense that they stipulate the position
of a PM relative to some part of the verbal complex. The constraint hierarchy
in (59) captures the order of importance between these alignment require-
ments. That is, the optimal candidate is selected based on its compatibility
with the highest relevant ranking constraint. For example, the clitic ne appears
after aš, an incorporated element, in aš¼ne¼b-sa ‘work-3SG-do-PRES’
because neither Align-PM-al/-a nor Align-PM-FocC is relevant in this context
since the speciWc constituents targeted by these constraints (i.e., -al/a and a
focus constituent) are not present. However, in the corresponding negative
version of that verb, the clitic does not come after aš in te¼ne-aš-b-sa ‘NEG-
3SG-work-do-PRES’ because the negative marker te is focused (i.e., a FocC).
Since Align-PM-FocC takes priority over Align-PM-IncE, the clitic must come
after the focused constituent even though aš is an incorporated element
(IncE). Note that Align-PM-FocC does not conspire with Align-PM-IncE to
derive the position of the endoclitic. The position is already stated in the
constraints themselves. The constraint ranking only speciWes which subcat-
egorization restriction should apply in a given situation. As such, at its core,
Harris’s analysis is very much within the spirit of the subcategorization
analysis advocated in this work. As already mentioned earlier, prioritization
between allomorphs with diVering subcategorization restrictions is independ-
ently motivated outside the context of inWxation, that is, whenever a structural
condition is targeted by more than one aYx alternant or subcategorization
restriction, the grammar must provide some mechanism to allow one
alternant to take precedence over another. (See Bonet, Lloret, and Mascaró
2003, Crysmann 2000, McCarthy and Wolf 2005, and Paster 2006 for more
discussion on how to capture allomorph prioritization eVects.)
The only OT-PR component of Harris’s analysis concerns the Align-
PM-Verbstem constraint. This constraint states that the right edge of a PM
must also be the right edge of the verb stem (indicated by ‘j’ in (60)). This
requirement creates a conXict between the proper realization of the root and
the proper placement of the clitics. According to Harris, when a PM clitic
occupies a position right of the verb root, it is outside the domain of the verb
Beyond inWxation 211
stem (60d). Assuming that segmental fusion is not possible, the closest the
right edge of a PM can be to the right edge of the verb stem is by inWxing the
clitic before the Wnal consonant of the verb stem (60c). There is no motivation
for inWxing the PM further inward since such a move would only increase the
violation of Align-PM-Verbstem(see (60a and b)).

This OT-PR analysis is not a necessity within Harris’s analysis, however. As
Harris herself points out, the Align-PM-Verbstem analysis can easily be
reformulated as in terms of the PM targeting the Wnal-consonant-pivot (i.e.,
Align(PM, R, C]Vst, L) (Harris 2002: 153)). With this substitution, Harris’s
analysis is perfectly in line with the framework laid out in this work since all
output endocliticized words are licensed by at least one of the subcategor-
ization constraints. The positioning of the clitic does not rely on conXicts
between subcategorization restrictions as in the case of OT-PR (but see
Anderson 2005).
6.3.2 Pashto
Another classic example of endoclisis is found in Pashto, an Indo-Iranian
language spoken mainly in Afghanistan, and the neighboring regions. The
clitics of interest are given below:
(61) Pashto Group I clitics (Tegey 1977: 81)

ba will, might, must, should, may
de should, had, better, let
212 Beyond inWxation
Adverbial clitics
xo indeed, really, of course
no then
These clitics are second-position clitics, thus generally appear after the Wrst
major constituent of the sentence, regardless of its length or grammatical
function (contrast (62a) and (62b)). As a result of this strict second-position
distribution, the verb might appear initial (62c) even though Pashto is
essentially a SOV language. It should be noted that the constituent which
a clitic ‘leans’ on must crucially carry lexical stress. For example, in (62d), the
clitic does not come after the initial prepositional phrase (i.e., rA ta ‘for me’)
since none of the items inside the prepositional phrase bears stress.
(62) a. xušAl aw patang ¼ba ye d@r ta rAwr

That Pashto illustrates second-position cliticization is not disputed. The case
for endoclisis is, however, a matter of debate. Evidence of endocliticization
comes from two sets of verbs in Pashto. First, there is a set of verbs that begin
with /a/ where stress may appear on the penultimate/ultimate syllable or on
the initial syllable in the imperfective form. The clitic generally appears post-
verbally (63a). However, when stress falls on the Wrst syllable, the clitic appears
after the Wrst syllable (63b). According to Tegey, there is no independent
evidence to substantiate the claim that the initial /a/ is a separate morpheme
from the rest of the stem.

Beyond inWxation 213
Likewise, there exists a restricted set of monomorphemic words which form
their perfective stem by shifting main stress to the initial syllable. When stress
is initial, the clitics appear after the Wrst syllable (64b), otherwise, they appear
post-verbally (64a).

Whether the examples in (63) and (64) show genuine endoclisis has been a
matter of much discussion. The general pattern appears to be that, when
endoclisis occurs, the clitics invariably appear after the initial stressed syllable.
However, initial stress alone is not enough to predict endoclisis. There are, for
example, imperfective verbs that show variable stress assignment that is
characteristic of the /a/-initial words, but such verbs do not aVord the type
of endoclisis option that is observed in the /a/-initial stems above.

Kaisse (1981) treats /a/-initial verbs analytically as morphologically complex,
even though many of the /a/-initial verbs are historically monomorphemic
(see also Anderson 2005). She contends that the meaninglessness of /a/ is not
suYcient to rule out a bipartite treatment of these verbs since it is the
distribution of the morpheme and its ability to undergo rules of allomorphy
that are the most reliable criteria for morpheme-hood (cf. AronoV 1976). The
analysis of /a/- as a preWx is, according to Kaisse, supported by the fact that
/a/- undergoes vowel coalescence but other vowels do not (i.e., when a @-Wnal
particle precedes an /a/-initial word, the two vowels coalesce to an [A]). If this
morphological analysis is proven correct, then the examples in (63) actually
illustrate a post-initial morpheme distribution of the clitics; thus Pashto does
not have a genuine case of endoclisis, at least with respect to the examples in
(63). The reanalysis of monomorphemic forms as bimorphemic, however,
seems highly implausible for the forms in (64). As Tegey points out,
the syllable after which the clitics are placed is not an identiWable morpheme;
neither are there rules of allomorphy that aVect the Wrst syllable of these
verbs.
214 Beyond inWxation
The bipartite treatment of the verbs in (63) and (64) misses two important
generalizations regarding the distribution of the endoclitics, however. The
appearance of endoclisis is tightly correlated with initial stress; no endoclisis
occurs when stress is on the penultimate syllable, for example (e.g.,
pAced´
@le¼ba ‘You would be getting up’ never *pAced´
@¼ba¼le). Initial stress
is crucially a characteristic property of the perfective stems, thus endoclisis
essentially takes place in perfective stems only (save the initially stressed /a/-
initial stems in (63)). To illustrate this point, let us brieXy review the basic
pattern of perfective morphology in Pashto.
Pashto verbs may be in the perfective or imperfective. In the imperfective
form, all verbs show main stress on either the ultimate or penultimate
syllable (though see below for certain lexical exceptions). However, in the
perfective form, stress is always stem-initial. Tegey further divides Pashto
verbs into three classes. Class-I verbs form their perfective with the preWx
w@-. The Class-II verbs are characterized by the fact that the stem always
contains a derivational preWx. Since the Class-II perfective stem is marked by
a stress shift to the initial position only, stress alway falls on the derivational
preWx in the perfective. Finally, Class-III verbs, which comprise the majority of
verbs, consist of an auxiliary plus an adjective, an adverb, or a noun. The
non-auxiliary component is referred to by Tegey as the ‘initial lexical com-
ponent’. Unlike the other classes where stress is on the initial syllable in the
perfective form, Class-III perfective stems invariably have stress on the initial
lexical component, although stress might be on the Wrst syllable or the second
syllable of the output depending on the nature of the initial lexical component.
Of particular interest here is the distribution of the clitics when the verb is
in sentence-initial position. In the imperfective context (save the /a/-initial
imperfective verbs discussed above), the clitics invariably appear after the
verb, regardless of verb class (66). That is, the clitics are encliticized to
the imperfective verb. In the perfective, however, the clitics appear after the
stressed perfective preWx in Class I (66a), after the stressed derivational
preWx in Class II (66b), or after the stressed initial lexical component in
Class III (66c).

Verbs that admit endoclitization in (64) are structurally similar to Class-I
verbs (i.e., monomorphemic), but they do not form their perfectives with the
preWx w@- (thus in this respect, more like the Class-II verbs). Crucially, clitics
may only appear after the initial syllable when the verb is in the perfective,
never in the imperfective.
A complete analysis of second-position cliticization in Pashto will not be
attempted here since such a project would necessarily include discussion of
various aspects of Pashto syntax and would therefore bring the present
discussion too afar aWeld. Instead, I shall limit myself to accounting for the
intramorphemic behavior of these clitics. To begin with, it must be assumed
that there exist diVerent alloclitics in Pashto. These alloclitics have in common
the fact that the clitic is phonologically subcategorizing for a leftmost stressed
constituent; the clitic must appear to the right of that constituent. The
accented constituent may be of diVerent sizes (e.g., DP, PP, PrWd, etc.).
Endoclisis obtains when the right edge of the subcategorized phonological
constituent does not coincide with the right edge of a morphological bound-
ary. Such a scenario arises when the leftmost accented constituent is a
perfective verb. Here, I assume that the co-phonology associated with per-
fective stem formation projects a minimal PrWd11 above the stressed con-
stituent (67a), whereas the co-phonology of other stem types do not have
such a feature (67b).

This analysis captures the systematic connection between endoclisis and the
initial stress of perfective stems naturally. Clitics will always have a post-initial
syllable or a post-initial morpheme distribution in the perfective since
the leftmost accented PrWd coincides with the initial syllable, as in the
Class-I verbs and the irregular verbs in (64), or the initial morpheme in
11 I assume here that the minimal PrWd in Pashto is a CV syllable.
216 Beyond inWxation
Class-II and Class-III verbs. Note, however, that endoclisis, like inWxation, is
epiphenomenonal in the sense that the clitics themselves do not demand an
intramorphemic distribution. Endoclisis arises only when the phonological
constituent subcategorized by the clitics is smaller than the morphological
constituent of the host.
The analysis laid out thus far is silent with regard to endoclisis in the /a/-initial
stems, however. As noted earlier, /a/-initial verbs belong to the Class-I category
since their perfective counterparts contain the w@- preWx. In the imperfective,
these stems show variable stress placement. While the analysis I sketched above
assumes that only the co-phonology associated with perfective stem formation
creates the type of prosodic structures that are conducive to endoclisis, the fact
that endoclisis obtains in imperfective /a/-initial verbs when stress falls on the
initial syllable, suggests that initially stressed imperfective /a/-initial verbs must
share the type of prosodic characteristics found in the perfective stems. My
solution here is to assume the co-phonology that produces initial stress in the
imperfective /a/-initial stem also projects a minimal PrWd above the stressed
syllable, just like the perfective stem co-phonology. Such an analysis, however,
leaves unanswered the question why only initially stressed /a/-initial stems allow
endoclitization but not other initially stressed stems. That is, why imperfective
verbs like p´
@rebd@¼me ‘I was beating him’ do not have an endocliticized
counterpart (i.e., *p´
@¼me¼rebd@) but the imperfective of /a/-initial verbs do
(e.g., áxist@l@¼me  á¼me¼xist@l@ ‘I was buying them’)? The answer, I argue,
lies in the morpho-phonology of the /a/-initial verbs. Recall that the initial vowel
of /a/-initial verbs undergoes coalescence when preceded by a /@/-Wnal preWx.
Thus, in the perfective context, the /@/ of the perfective preWx coalesces with the
initial /a/ of the root, yielding /A/ (68a). No such coalescence occurs with other
vowel-initial roots (68b).

Crucially, when endocliticization takes place in the perfective /a/-initial verbs,
the clitic appears after the coalesced vowel, rendering opaque the fact that the
root is vowel-initial.

Beyond inWxation 217
In light of the lack of coalescence of the initial vowel in other cliticized vowel-
initial stems and the regular behavior of consonant-initial stems under
cliticization, learners of Pashto might have erroneously concluded that
forms like (69) contain the (bound) root /xla/ (70). When they Wnally
encounter evidence of the presence of the initial /a/, they might conclude
that the structure of such roots is like that of the Class-II verbs, thus contain-
ing some sort of a lexical preWx. In a nutshell, the ability of /a/-initial stems to
project a minimal PrWd above the stressed syllable is coerced by the pseudo-
preWxal status of /a/ and the optional initial stress assignment.

In sum, I have argued that endoclisis is the result of certain initially stressed
verbs projecting a PrWd above the stressed syllable. Since the second-position
clitics are targeting the Wrst stressed constituent of the sentence, the clitics
appear endocliticized in (63) and (64) because the right edge of the Wrst
stressed PrWd falls within the domain of the morphological host. This
analysis thus shares Kaisse’s assumption that the /a/-initial stems in (63) are
morphologically complex. But no such stipulation is needed for the stems in
(64). Endoclisis obtains because of the prosodic structure of the word, not
because of the morphological structure per se.
In this section, I have surveyed a number of reported cases of endoclitics.
To the extent that endoclitics and inWxation share common distributional
properties, endoclitics targets phonological constituents that are also at the
edge of some domain or some prosodically prominent position. The intra-
morphemic distribution of endoclitics, like inWxes, is the result of misalign-
ment between the phonological and morphological domains. As such,
endoclitics are formally no diVerent from inWxes (e.g., Anderson 1992, 2000,
2005; Lengendre 2000). The only substantive divergence is in the phonological
constituent subcategorized. In the case of inWxes, the phonological domains
tend to be within the scope of a word, while in the case of endoclitics, higher
phonological domains such as the Phonological Phrase might be relevant.
6.4 Feature and subcategorization
A curious aspect of phonological subcategorization in general is the fact that
aYxes may sometimes subcategorize at the featural level as well. For example,
in English, the inchoative suYx -en (e.g., darken, stiVen, redden) is restricted
12 This form is constructed based on the information given in Tegey 1977.
218 Beyond inWxation
to stems ending in obstruents (e.g., *coolen, *thinnen, *puren). Similarly, in
Tahitian, the causative/factitive has two allomorphs, ha’a- and fa’a-. The ha’a-
allomorph can only be preWxed to roots that begin with a labial while the fa’a-
is applied elsewhere (Lazard and Peltzer 2000; Paster 2006).13
(71) a. Wu ‘se lasser’ ha’a-Wu ‘ennuyer, s’ennuyer’

b. ’amu ‘manger’ fa’a-’amu ‘faire manger, nourrir’
rave ‘faire’ fa’a-rave ‘faire faire’
tai’o ‘lire’ fa’a-tai’o ‘faire lire’
While many such cases of featural conditioning on aYxation have been
documented in Paster (2006), it remains unclear to what extent inWxes are
sensitive to information at the featural level. To be sure, cases of feature-
sensitive allomorphy involving inWxation are not diYcult to Wnd (e.g., Cro-
whurst 1998; Pater 2001; Yu 2004a). For example, in Muna, an Austronesian
language spoken on Muna Island, located oV the southeast coast of the crab-
shaped island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, the realis and irrealis distinction on
certain verb stems is partly distinguished by the inWxation of -um- after the
initial consonant (72a) or by the preWxation of m- to vowel-initial forms
(72b). (Muna data cited below are drawn from van den Berg 1989.)

When roots begin with p or f, these consonants are replaced by m (73a), but
when the root begins with b, bh, nasal or prenasalized consonants, there is no
formal change in the root (73b).15 Finally, while the majority of roots with

Feature-sensitive inWxal allomorphy of the sort found in Muna provides an
instructive example of how the featural composition of the stem may deter-
mine, if only partly, the shape of the allomorph (Pater 2001) or the selection of
suppletive allomorphs (Yu 2004a). But beyond allomorphy, there are also
claims that certain cases of inWxation might be governed by factors at the
featural level. In what follows, I evaluate the evidence from two languages:
Kashaya Pomo and Tiene.
6.4.1 Kashaya Pomo
Buckley (1997) reports that the exponents of the Plural Act feature in Kashaya
Pomo, a Pomoan language of northern California, may be inWxed to improve
the featural content of the coda and to prevent the deletion of distinctive
features. For example, the -ta- allomorph is suYxed to verbs that end in one
of the consonants /l, n, n
’, c
’ / (see (74a)) but is inWxed when the Wnal
consonant is /m, q, qw
, c/ (see (74b)).

duqa:c- duqa-ta-c- ‘get lost’
At Wrst glance, -ta- appears to be targeting roots that end in a non-coronal
segment for inWxation. Working within the framework of OT-PR, Buckley
argues that the inWxation of -ta- takes place when the stem-Wnal consonant
is non-coronal but not when the stem is coronal-Wnal because the phono-
logical grammar of Kashaya Pomo tolerates coronal codas better than it
tolerates non-coronal codas. As shown in (75a), when the root ends in a
coronal, no inWxation is needed since the constraint militating against
coronal codas is ranked lower than the suYxing requirement of -ta-. On
the other hand, inWxation is preferable when the root ends in a labial. This
is because the inWxation of -ta- eliminates any labial coda on the surface
(see (75d)).

Buckley’s analysis is only viable, however, if the Wnal labial in candidate (75d)
fails to incur a Lab]s violation (e.g., bi.la.qh
a.tam#). To this end, Buckley
contends that the forms cited in (74) are incomplete and that the Wnal
consonant is an onset since a following vowel-initial suYx can be assumed
(e.g., bi.la.qh
a.ta.m-V). When the inWxed stem is followed by a consonant-
initial suYx (e.g., bi.la.qh
a.tam.-CV), Buckley argues, paradigm uniformity
requires that the Plural Act aYx occupy the same position.
This featural-markedness-driven OT-PR analysis is problematic on two
counts, however. First, if paradigm uniformity has an eVect on aYx place-
ment at all, it is not clear why the uniformity eVect does not restore -ta- to its
underlying adpositional position. All else being equal, the logic of OT-PR
always favors inertia. More to the point is the fact that -ta- is but
one of thirteen possible exponents of the Plural Act feature. As shown
in (76), the distribution of these allomorphs is not at all transparent
Beyond inWxation 221
(Buckley 1994). In many cases, the distributions, at least in terms of the
phonological restrictions, are very much overlapping.

-w after a vowel; co-occurs with the Durative
-w after a long vowel; co-occurs with the Durative; Decrement
The many exponents of the Plural Act feature highlight the fact that this
morpho-syntactic operation is unlikely to be a productive process in the
language; diVerent subcategorization restrictions must be stated for diVerent
allomorphs. On the question of whether the subcategorization restrictions of
these allomorphs need to target speciWc phonological features, the answer
seems to be negative. As shown in (76), many of the allomorphs apply to
similar environments, suggesting the choice of the Plural Act allomorph is
idiosyncratic to the verb and must be stipulated. It is also worth pointing out
that many allomorphs of this Plural Act feature contain /q, m/ as their Wnal
segments, the very segments that trigger inWxation in Buckley’s analysis. In
fact, one of the allomorphs, -ataq, shows essentially the sequence one would
expect if -ta- is inWxed in a q-Wnal root. This resemblance between the set of
alleged inWx-triggering segments and the allomorphs of the Plural Act
feature appears to be too regular to be a mere coincidence. Further research
may prove this case to be an instance of entrapment. If so, the suppletive
subcategorization requirements of the Plural Act allomorphs are the natural
results of the entrapment pathway, as noted in Chapter 5.
6.4.2 Tiene
Tiene is a Niger-Congo language spoken in the Democratic Republic of
Congo. Hyman and Inkelas (1997) report that certain extension suYxes in
16 The Decrement is a morphologically triggered rule that deletes a laryngeal increment (Buckley 1994:
288). Laryngeal increments, on the other hand, are glottal segments (/?/ or /h/) or sometimes vowel length
that has the eVect of ‘strengthening or adding weight to the vowel which it follows’ (Buckley 1994: 269).
222 Beyond inWxation
this language are inWxed to the verb roots in order to satisfy certain templatic
restrictions. In particular, when the suYx consonant is coronal, such as the
applicative and the causative markers, and the root ends in a velar, the coronal
aYx is inWxed into the velar-Wnal root (77a). However, when the root is
coronal-Wnal and the suYx consonant is velar, straightforward suYxation is
observed (77b).
(77) a. [[CVK]VT] ! -CVTVK- [inWxation]17
lók-a ‘vomit’ lósek-E ‘cause to vomit’ <PB*-es-[causative]
yók-a ‘hear’ yólek-E ‘listen to’ <PB*-ed- [applicative]
b. [[CVT]VK] ! -CVTVK- [‘normal’ suYxation]
bol-a ‘break’ bolek-E ‘be broken’ <PB*-ek- [stative]
kot-a ‘tie’ kotek-E ‘be united’ <PB*-uk-[reversive]
Likewise, when the root-Wnal consonant is grave (labial/velar), the stative and
reversive would inWx their coronal allomorphs (78), instead of selecting the
suYxal velar allomorphs shown in (77b).
(78) [[CVK]VK] ! -CVTVK- [-VT allomorph used instead of -VK]
kab-a ‘divide’ kalab-a ‘be divided’ ?<PB*-ad-[stative]
sook-E ‘put in’ solek-E ‘take-out’ <PB*-od- [reversive]
At Wrst glance, this case seems to be an instance of inWxing before a grave
consonant. However, as shown in (79), when both the root-Wnal consonant
and the suYx consonant are coronal, ‘imbrication’ takes place. That is, C2 and
C3 undergo fusion which results in a single surface coronal consonant.
(79) [[CVT]VT] ! -CVVT- [‘imbrication’ (¼fusion)]
mat-a ‘go away’ maas-a ‘make go away’ ?<PB*-es [causative]
koﬁ-a ‘nibble’ kooﬁ-E ‘nibble for’ <PB*-ed-[applicative]
(80) summarizes the range of behaviors described thus far. Four aYxes, the
stative, reversive, applicative, and causative, are inWxed under certain condi-
tions. The applicative undergoes imbrication in other circumstances. (The /L/
represents the alternation between [l] and [n] according to nasal harmony
while the /K/ indicates alternates between [k] and [˛].) The question here is
under what circumstances inWxation and imbrication take place. The answer
has to do with the phonology of the DStem and the Base. (In Hyman
and Inkelas’s terminology, the DStem refers to the derivational stem which
17 Hyman and Inkelas (1997) treat the extension suYxes as purely consonantal since the stem-
internal vowels are determined by vowel harmony while the Wnal vowel is determined by a combin-
ation of morphological and phonological considerations. Only the vowel in V1 position is contrastive.
Beyond inWxation 223
includes the root and the extension suYxes but not the Wnal vowel. The ‘Base’
refers to both derived and underived stems without the Wnal vowel.)

b. Applicative, causative L, s inWxation (CVC !CVLVC)

Hyman and Inkelas argue that the DStem in Tiene must be minimally and
maximally bimoraic (i.e., CVVC or CVCVC). The Base, on the other hand,
has strict segmental templatic requirements: C2 must be coronal while C3
must be grave. Since the DStem is a subtype of Base, DStems must conform to
these restrictions as well. As they apply to the Base, these restrictions are also
obeyed in non-derived stems. The reconstructed forms below show that
the place of articulation restrictions has been enforced diachronically
(‘GCB’ ¼ Guthrie Common Bantu).

dı́nem- ‘get lost’ C-n-m GCB *-dı́med-
The evidence thus far suggests that the placement of the extension aYxes is
severely constrained by the phonotactics of the DStem and the Base. The
unresolved question here is exactly how these restrictions interact with aYx
placement. Several approaches are available. From the perspective of phono-
logical subcategorization, suppletive subcategorization frames can be set up
for each of the allomorphs. For example, while the K-allomorph of the stative/
reversive is suYxing, the L-allomorph is left-subcategorizing for the root
vowel. Such an account misses the connections between the observed tem-
platic restrictions and the placement of the extension aYx, however. The main
issue here is how does an approach that prohibits direct interaction between
phonological factors with aYx placement capture the link between the
observed templatic restrictions and the placement of the extension aYxes?
This question, however, is misguided. The real question, I maintain, is
whether the extensions have subcategorization restrictions at all. The proper
placement of the extension aYxes is entirely predictable based on the restric-
tions placed on the realization of the DStem and the Base. There is no need
to stipulate any subcategorization requirement for the extension aYxes.
Formally, I propose that extension aYxes in Tiene are underspeciWed
for subcategorization restriction. The placement of the aYx exponents is
224 Beyond inWxation
governed solely by the co-phonology of the DStem and the Base. Take, for
example, the causative construction below:
(82) causative-stem
SYNSEM
PHON
SUBCAT --

SYNSEM 2
PHON 1

ϕ{DSTEM/BASE}
Recall that, in SBM, the phonological exponents of aYxes are represented as
Wxed arguments to the phonological function (i.e., the w-function), speciWed
in aYxational constructions. As such, the phonological content of the aYx
interacts directly with the phonological constraints in the w-function. In
general, the co-phonology is only responsible for selecting the proper allo-
morphs. However, the causative stem construction in (82) speciWes no
subcategorization restriction. A stem of the type causative-stem must be a
combination of a verb root with /s/. Since /s/ has no subcategorization
restriction, the proper realization of /s/ with respect the verb root 1 is left
entirely to the co-phonology, which enforces the templatic restrictions of
the DStem and the Base. Here, I adopt Hyman and Inkelas’s analysis of the
templatic restrictions, which are captured by the constraints in (83).
(83) Nadir ‘An intervocalic C must be coronal.’
OCP[Cor].Trough ‘No two adjacent coronals in the Trough.’
Nadir states that intervocalic consonants must be coronal. OCP[Cor] speciWes
that no two adjacent coronals are allowed. These constraints are crucially
relativized to the prosodic Trough domain. The Trough ‘is a substring of
the form under review in which (i) contrasts are suppressed and/or (ii) special
input-output relations obtain’ (Hyman and Inkelas 1997: 101). In Tiene, the
Trough (t) is a substring of the base which excludes C1 and the Wnal vowel (84).
(84) Tiene DStem trough: <C><V> (where  ¼ VCVC, VVC)
As shown in (85), the constraints in (83) conspire to rule out forms that do not
conform to the templatic restrictions. Nadir rules out *l(abab) and *l(abas)
since the intervocalic consonants within the Trough are not coronal. OCP
[Cor]. Tr eliminates *l(asas) since there are two coronals within the Trough
domain. (The Trough is demarcated in the candidates by parentheses.)

With regard to the question of inWxation, I diverge from Hyman and Inkelas’s
analysis. Working within the OT-PR approach to inWxation, Hyman and
Inkelas argue that inWxation is the result of certain phonological constraints
subverting the underlying suYxing nature of the extension aYxes. For
example, when the causative /-s/ attaches to a grave-Wnal root such as lók
‘vomit’, the candidate with an inWxed causative (86a) is selected because the
suYxation of /s/ (86b) would have fatally violated Nadir.

Similarly, when a stative or a reversive attaches to a grave-Wnal root, the
inWxing L allomorph is selected (87bii) since candidates with a K allomorph

inWxally (87a).

From the perspective of the present theory (i.e., (82)), there is no ‘movement’
of any aYx per se since there is no intrinsic subcategorization restriction
speciWed in the construction. To be sure, neither is there morpho-
phonological mismatch in the sense of the theory of phonological subcat-
egorization examined in this work. The proper realization of /s/ is determined
by the co-phonology alone. When Nadir dominates ContiguityIO, a con-
straint that prohibits morpheme interruption, ‘inWxation’ of a coronal

Imbrication obtains when both the root-Wnal consonant and the suYx
consonant are coronal. As shown in (90), straightforward suYxation or
inWxation of the causative /s/ will fatally violate OCP[Cor].Tr. The preferred
solution in Tiene is the deletion of one of the oVending segments. Which
consonant is deleted depends on the nature of the root-Wnal consonant and
the consonant of the aYx. While the root-Wnal consonant is deleted when the
Beyond inWxation 227
aYx is the causative -s (90), the aYxal consonant is deleted in the applicative
(e.g., /bot, -L/ ! boot /*bool). In general, it is preferable to delete a sonorant,
rather than an obstruent. Stridents are always preserved.18

In sum, inWxation in Tiene is a matter of output well-formedness satisfaction.
Note that the co-phonology does not determine ‘aYxing ordering’ per se. The
exponents of the extension aYxes are treated Wxed arguments to the phono-
logical function with no intrinsic meaning associated; meaning is associated
with the construction itself, not with what is speciWed in the phonological
function.19 It is interesting to note that the present case of subcategorization-
less morphological derivation is only possible due to several very speciWc
factors. First, DStems in Tiene may only have one extension at a time. Second,
the range of possible locations of extension exponent realization is extremely
limited (i.e., either C2 or C3 of a DStem) due to the prosodic size restriction
imposed on all DStems (i.e., bimoraic minimality and maximality) and the
strict conditions placed on the nature of C2 and C3. This state of aVairs
suggests that, when phonological factors play a role in aYx placement, they
do so in a very restrictive fashion. In her survey of over 400 grammars, Paster
found only Wve putative cases of phonologically driven aYx ordering, where
the ordering of multiple aYxes is said to be determined by phonological
factors regardless of semantic scope and/or subcategorization restrictions.
She demonstrates that all Wve cases are amenable to alternative, non-
phonologically governed, analyses. Note also that the framework advocated
in this work oVers a natural account for patterns like Tiene. When subcat-
egorization is underspeciWed, the position of an aYxal exponent is
determined by the phonological function alone. Subcategorization under-
speciWcation is likely motivated by the fact that the phonological template
oVers a more reliable predictor to aYx location than the suppletive subcat-
egorizations otherwise needed to account for the variable placement of the

following ranking: Max(Strident) >> Max(Obstruent) >> Max(Sonorant).
19 In SBM, zero derivation is essentially a construction that contributes no additional Wxed
argument to the phonological function.

allomorphs. The rarity of subcategorization underspeciWcation, on the
other hand, can be explained by the fact that the type of strict output well-
formedness conditions required to sustain a subcategorizationless analysis is
likely to be diYcult to obtain diachronically.
6.5 Conclusion
Throughout this work, I have argued for a theory of inWxation that casts inWxes
as essentially epiphenomenal. That is, inWxes emerge, for example, when an
aYx subcategorizes for an edge of a phonological constituent (i.e., a P-edge)
that does not match one of the edges of the morphological host. The phenom-
enon of ‘inWxation’, as it were, is illusory since the intramorphemic distribu-
tion of an aYx is not intrinsic to the subcategorization information itself.
InWxes, at the fundamental level, are no diVerent from their adpositional
cousins (e.g., preWxes and suYxes). Since pivots are deWned over phonological
constituents and constituency at the phonological level is generally derived
rather than assumed a priori, it is not surprising that misalignment between
the phonological edge and morphological boundary takes place. An important
prediction of this theory of inWxation is that, all else being equal, a phono-
logical-subcategorizing aYx is predicted to realize adpositionally whenever
the P-edge subcategorized by an aYx coincides with one of the edges of the
morphological host. Also, this theory predicts that inWxes are predominantly
edge-oriented because the set of subcategorizable phonological pivots are
edge-based (with the obvious caveat of the prominence pivots).
InWxation is not a necessary outcome of phonological subcategorization,
however. InWxation is possible only if the language tolerates the creation of
derived discontinuous morphs (in OT-terms, inWxation is only possible when
contiguity of the input string can be violated). When morpheme interruption
is prohibited, languages may respond to the failure to satisfy a phonological
subcategorization requirement in diVerent ways. Carstairs-McCarthy (1998)
identiWes three strategies: (a) unsystematic Wlling of the gaps; (b) systematic
morphological Wlling of the gaps; and (c) systematic syntactic Wlling of the
gaps via periphrasis. For example, abstract noun formation in English is an
instance of (a). The deverbal nominalizing suYx -al in English is restricted to
bases with main stress on the Wnal syllable. Thus, words like arrı́val, commı́t-
tal, reférral and refúsal are possible, but *abólishal, *béneWtal, *devélopal,
*exáminal are not (Carstairs-McCarthy 1998). On the view of the present
theory, the nominalizing suYx -al is left-subcategorizing for the stressed
syllable. Thus when the stressed syllable falls on the last syllable of the root,
-al appears suYxing. However, unlike the inWxes reviewed in this work, -al

cannot appear intramorphemically when the stressed syllable is internal to
the root (e.g., *exam-al-ine is impossible). Instead, English verbs whose
phonology prevents the attachment of the noun-forming -al may form their
corresponding abstract noun in alternative ways (e.g., abolition, development,
examination), even though the choice of these alternative strategies is not
systematic. An example of morphological Wlling of gaps is found in Saami, a
Lappic language spoken in Norway. In this language, the exponents of person
marking on verbs are determined by the syllable count of the stem. Stems with
an even syllable count take the person markers under the ‘even’ paradigm,
while stems with an odd syllable count take the ‘odd’ paradigm (Dolbey 1997).
(91) pers/num allomorphy
‘even’ ‘odd’ jéar.ra- ‘to ask’ véah.ke.hea- ‘to help’
1 du. Ø -tne je:r.re-Ø veah.ke.he:-t.ne
2 du. -beahtti -hppi jear.ra.-beaht.ti veah.ke.hea-hp.pi
2 pl. -behtet -hpet jear.ra.-beh.tet veah.ke.he:-h.pet
3 pl. pret -Ø -dje je:r.re-Ø veah.ke.he:-d.je
Finally, languages may Wll a gap by syntactic means. For example, adjectives
that do not form their comparative and superlative with the -er and -est
suYxes respectively employ a periphrasis with more and most instead (e.g.,
more curious, most sensitive etc.).
As this book comes to a close, I hope that, while this work provides answers
to questions concerning the nature of inWxation, it also raises others. The
holistic approach to linguistic explanation pursued in this work, which
emphasizes the need to consider both grammar-internal and grammar-exter-
nal forces in shaping the typological proWle of a phenomenon, has witnessed
some advances in the phonological domains in recent years (e.g., Blevins,
2004; Mielke, 2004). Much work remains if a fuller understanding of many
phonological phenomena, especially the source of Prosodic Morphology (but
see Niepokuj 1997), is to be obtained. As many mysteries are still waiting to be
unveiled, this book shall be a call to arms.
