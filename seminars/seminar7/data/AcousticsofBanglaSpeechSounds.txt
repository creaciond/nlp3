production it is observed that in case of vowels /u/, /o/ and /ɔ/ lips are rounded. The
degree of roundness is less in case of /ɔ/ compared to /u/ and /o/. It may be
mentioned that it is possible to get objective quantitative measures of roundedness
through computer processing of the images. It was not felt needed to do so for the
simple reason that in vowel diagrams rounding is a binary decision.
1.3.3 Summary for Vowels with Native Read Speech
From the Cardinal vowel diagram (Figs. 1.16, 1.17 and 1.18) obtained through
objective analysis of speech of a selected set of native speakers of both sexes the
following points emerge:

• The height of the Bangla vowel which is represented by [u] in the IPA chart is
much lower than that of the cardinal vowel [u] and closer to Cardinal vowel [Ʊ].
• The height of the Bangla vowel [æ] is quite close to the cardinal vowel [œ].
• Bangla neutral vowel lies almost midway between [ɞ] and [ɔ] and since it is a
back vowel one may choose [ɔ].
• The height of the Bangla vowel [i] is lower than that of the cardinal vowel [i]
and closer to [I].
• The Bangla vowel which is represented generally by the IPA symbol [a] is much
closer to the cardinal vowel [ɐ].
• All Bangla vowels are quite centralized in comparison with the cardinal vowels.

1.3.4 Vowels in Controlled Environment
While the aforesaid studies use data from sense words used in continuous speech
the vowels are not necessarily always properly pronounced. While the change of
vowels in different contextual context is expected to differ in continuous speech the
errors usually go beyond that. It is true that for technology development as well as
to understand to what extent vowels get perturbed in actual speech the above results
are very important. However at the same time it is necessary to know the position of
vowels when they are spoken with attention. Let us call this ‘formal pronunciation’
as against the ‘informal pronunciations’ of spoken sentences presented in the pre-
vious sections. For studying formal pronunciation the same set of informants were
asked to utter nonsense words of the form /cvcvcvcv/. Being aware that personal
bias may still creep in the utterances were subjected to a listening test by three
senior Bangla linguists for goodness of pronunciation. The steady states of the
vowels from the selected proper pronunciations are used for extraction of formants.

well as those for data pooled over the sexes. In this table N represents the number of
samples. The small discrepancies that are observed between N for F1 and F2 is
because some data is rejected if not found clearly from spectrograms.
A comparative perusal of Tables 1.3 and 1.5 reveals that F1 of [a] and [æ] is
lowered in conversational speech indicating that the jaw is not lowered fully. This is
quite expected in free speech as the extra effort and attention required for proper
pronunciation of these vowels may not be maintained in normal speech. For other
vowels the difference in F1 is not signiﬁcant. One would expect neutralization of F2
for conversational speech compared to proper pronunciation. It is corroborated
generally since F2 is raised for back vowels and lowered for front vowels in
conversational speech. The only exceptions are [ɔ] and [e].
One should expect that the spread of the data distribution to be less for controlled
pronunciation. One way to check this is to look at the standard deviations. While
doing this one should take a comparative measure of SD with respect to mean
values. The average of the ratio SD/Mean for all data for both the formal pro-
nunciation and the informal pronunciation was calculated. The result came out as
0.145399 and 0.146205 respectively for informal and formal pronunciation, sur-
prisingly almost the same value. The reason is not difﬁcult to rationalize. It only
indicates that the contextual influences on the parameters much outweigh the
inadvertent errors in speech production. It only strengthens the notion of efﬁcacy in
the psycho-biological cybernetics involved in human speech development.

1.4 Nasal Vowels
In SCB all the seven oral vowels is known to have their nasal phonemic
counterpart. Since nasalization of vowels are phonemic in Bangla it is expected that
there would be some acoustic cue or cues consistent enough for perceptual dis-
tinction. It is therefore necessary to give special attention to this aspect for Bangla.
Nasal vowels are produced when the velum is open and the nasopharynx is coupled
with the oropharynx. If one examined Figs. 1.3 and 1.4 one may note that
depending on the position of tongue hump the nasal cavity can act as a shunt to the
ﬁrst cavity or both the front and back cavity. When the nasal cavity acts as a shunt
its resonances may act as the zeroes for the system causing antiformants to appear.
Otherwise they introduce further formants sometimes as separate ones and at other
times strengthening the oral resonances. This is a gross simpliﬁcation of a complex
process. However it helps to have an idea how the coupling of nasopharynx
changes the timbral quality of produced sounds.
Some such cues are reported for some of the western and other foreign languages
(Fujimara 1960; Berkins and Stevens 1982; Takeuchi et al. 1975; Hawkins and
Stenens 1985). In general these studies reveal following acoustic cues for distinc-
tion of nasal over oral:
A. Strengthening of F0
B. Weakening of F1
C. Strengthening of F2
D. Raising of F1 and F2
E. Presence of nasal formants and anti formants.
As regards to the cues A to D studies in SCB reported (Datta et al. 1998) that the
strengthening of F0 on nasalization is observed for all central and front vowels
except [ɛ̃], the weakening of F1 for all except for vowel [ĩ] and [ɔ̃] and the raising of
F2 except for vowels [õ] and [ũ]. This is mostly because of the nasal antiformants
introduced due to the addition of nasal cavity in the resonating system through the
opening of the velum (Hawkins and Stenens 1985). Examination of spectrograms
shows consistent occurrences of nasal formants. For all vowels taken together nasal
formants are found to be clustered in the region of 900, 1250 and 1650 Hz. For [ẽ]
and [ũ] these are found between F1 and F2. Nasal formants are found stronger for
male informants. These are generally stronger for front vowels. Only exception is
the occurrence of an additional formant in oral [i].
Antiformants mostly lie below 1000 Hz. Majority of them lie within the range of
400–600 Hz. Except for [ũ] and [ĩ] nasal antiformants mostly lie within the range
200–600 Hz. Those for [ũ] are distributed over a wide range 1–1.9 kHz. For vowel
[ĩ] no nasal antiformants was observed. On the other hand antiformants were
observed for oral [i] in the range 800 Hz–1 kHz. For all vowels except [ũ] and [ĩ] at
least one antiformant is observed below 1 kHz. Both the places and the occurrences
of nasal formants and anti-formants in the referred case study in Bangla has been
1.4 Nasal Vowels 21
found to lack sufﬁcient consistency regarding distinction between the nasal vowels
themselves though they are quite indicative of nasalization.
The multiplicity, complexity and somewhat fluid situation regarding acoustic
signature of nasality in vowel from the standpoint of machine recognition led to a
study for the search of a single necessary and sufﬁcient acoustic cue for oral/nasal
distinction in Bangla (Datta et al. 1998). The study used analysis—through—
synthesis paradigm and reported that such a cue do exist in the case of Bangla. This
was one or two harmonics between F0 and F1 lying in the neighborhood of 400 Hz.
Figure 1.20 gives the example showing the harmonics which plays a pivotal role in
the nasal/oral distinction. The upper part of the ﬁgures shows the spectrum section
at the ﬁrst vowel. The second harmonics is responsible for distinction. This is
indicated by the crossing of curser lines. It may be seen that for vowel /ɐ/ this is
about 12 db higher than the corresponding nasalized /ɐ̃/. It has been noticed that for
high vowels /u/ and /i/ they are found to increase for nasal counterparts. For other
vowels they decrease. The very consistent nature of this cue calls for a detail
investigation into the relationship of the glottal waveform and the opening of
velum. Such a relationship has been observed in the case of aspirated vowels as we
shall see in a later section.
We have already noticed that the introduction of nasal formants causes, inter
alia, shifting of the ﬁrst two formants namely, F1 and F2. It is therefore necessary to
visualize nasal counterpart of each oral vowel in the F1-F2 plane.
Figure 1.21 presents the mean values of the ﬁrst two formant frequencies of oral
along with its nasal counterparts of the seven vowels in SCB. The difference of ﬁrst
formant frequencies between oral and nasal vowel is small, in most cases
insigniﬁcant, except for the mid vowels /e – ẽ/ and /o – õ/. The second formant is
decreased on nasalization for two back vowels /o/ and /u/, however it is found to
Fig. 1.20 The harmonic responsible for nasal/oral distinction
22 1 Vowels, Glides and Diphthongs
increase extraordinarily for the neutral vowel /ɔ/. For the other vowels there is
signiﬁcant increase of the second formant frequencies on nasalization. These
changes in the formant structure may be due to the intervention of formants and
antiformants introduced by the coupling of the nasopharynx as a result of opening
of velum.
1.5 Aspirated Vowels
Murmured and whispered vowels fall under the category of aspirated vowels as
the vocal chords are held apart further than in the case of normal or clear vowels.
A larger volume of air escapes between them producing an audible noise nor-
mally referred to as aspiration. The existence of murmured and whispered vowels
is reported in various languages including some Indian languages. In Gujarati
eight murmured vowels as well as eight murmured nasalized vowels has been
reported in contrast with corresponding clear oral and nasal vowels. Murmured
vowels in Marathi also have been reported (Masica 1991). Whispered vowels
have been noticed in the western dialect of Awadi (Saksena 1971). The objec-
tivity of these sounds has been widely researched in terms of ﬁnding the acoustic
contrastive cues. However, historically these vowels are regarded as allophones of
post-vocalic /h/ (Masica 1991). Esposito et al. (2007) reported breathy phonation
in /Nh/ clusters and some nasals in some Indian languages including Bengali. The
presence of the character [h] in some of the Indian scripts is associated with the
presence of murmured vowels in the corresponding spoken form in many Indian
languages (Wayland and Jongman 2003; Mistry 1997; Pandit 1954; Masica
1991). Apparently for Standard Colloquial Bengali (SCB) there has been, in
Fig. 1.21 Mean frequency distribution of seven Bangla of both oral and nasal vowel
1.4 Nasal Vowels 23
general, a lack of interest to investigate the objective as well as subjective
existence of this phenomenon. The whole attention seems to have been devoted to
characterize phonation corresponding to the grapheme হ ([h]) acoustically in
terms of whether they are voiced or unvoiced along with the presence of some
turbulent glottal noise. As we shall see later that in SCB there exist a wide range
of variance in spectral structures in various instances of the so-called [h]. We
shall also see that these could be reasonably grouped into some speciﬁc patterns
close to but distinctly different from those observed in clean vowels. It stands to
reason to say that a phoneme in any language must have a characteristic coherent
spectral structure including those reflected in the resonances (formants) and
anti-resonances (antiformants) determined by the articulatory conﬁguration. This
section intends to address this issue.
Taking cue from the aforesaid Indian languages an attempt is made to ﬁnd
murmured and whispered vowels, if any, in standard colloquial Bengali. The evi-
dences from other referred Indian languages allowed the area of search to be
narrowed down to investigate the acoustics of the signal in the neighbourhood of /h/
in such words. Hence, 37 words containing /h/ were selected with the expectation of
locating murmured and whispered vowels in standard colloquial Bengali. These
words spoken by 5 male and 5 female speakers in a neutral carrier sentence were
taken from the speech data base of CDAC, Kolkata as the data for the study.
Standard soft ware packages namely Cool-Edit Pro and Wave Surfer was used for
the extraction of acoustic parameters.
The acoustic signatures also have been investigated in detail elsewhere
(Fischer-Jorgensen 1967; Thongkum 1988; Wayland and Jongman 2003; Andruski
and Ratliff 2000; Hombert et al. 1979; Pandit 1954; Hillenbrand et al. 1994;
Hillenbrand and Houde 1996; Klatt and Klatt 1990). A synopsis of acoustic
parameters normally studied to characterize murmured and whispered vowels as
against clean vowels seems to be in order. The extensively investigated ﬁve
parameters are: (a) the ratio of energy in low to high frequency bands, (b) the ratio
of total energy of the candidate with respect to that of the adjoining clear vowel,
(c) the ratio of the fundamental frequency of murmured to adjoining clear vowels,
(d) the lower formant frequencies and (e) the relative amplitude of the ﬁrst two
harmonics. These along with a new parameter namely, the slope of periodic decay
associated with a period of a vowel in the signal has been investigated. This
parameter has been explained in detail in the next section.
The experimental results on SCB strongly indicate the presence of murmured
and whispered counterparts for almost all the clear vowels of the dialect. All these
are found to represent the character [h] in the textual representation of the word. It is
seen that only 7 out of the 257 samples examined were found to be pure fricative
noise.
24 1 Vowels, Glides and Diphthongs
1.5.1 Acoustics of Aspirated Vowels
Murmured voice (also called Breathy voice) is a phonation in which the vocal cords
vibrate, as they do in normal (modal) voicing, but are held further apart, so that a
larger volume of non-pulsating steady air also escapes between them (Laver 1980;
Gordon 2001; Chávez-Peón 2013). This produces an audible noise normally
referred to as aspiration. The vocal cords while held slightly apart are lax so that
they vibrate loosely. Sometimes the vocal cords are brought closer together along
their entire length but not as close as in modally voiced sounds such as clear
vowels. This results in an airflow intermediate between a fricative and vowels.
Another way to produce a murmured vowel is to constrict the glottis, but separate
the Arytenoid cartilages that control one end. This results in the vocal cords being
drawn together for voicing in the back, but separated enough to allow the passage
of large volumes of air for voicing in the front. The produced acoustic features are
quite distinctive from those of clean vowels on one hand and the pure sibilants on
the other hand. In general the glottal gesture in producing aspirated vowels is such
that it allows a continuous stream of air to flow along with oscillations of vocal
folds.
The whisper has been regarded occasionally as a simple modiﬁcation of breathy
voice. Whispered speech is produced by modulating the flow of air through partially
open vocal folds. Because the source of excitation is turbulent air flow, the acoustic
characteristics of whispered speech differs from voiced speech. Since the aspiration
source is located near the glottis, no zero appears in the trans-conductance between
this series pressure source and the acoustic flow at the lips (Ngoc and Badin 1994).
Physiological measurement of the laryngeal shape during whispering by using
magnetic resonance imaging shows that the supra-glottal structures were not only
constricted but also shifted downward, attaching to the vocal fold to prevent vocal
fold vibration (Tsunoda et al. 1997). Acoustic analyses show that for whispered
vowels the ‘formant-like’ features (i.e. the hills in the spectral structure) in the region
of F1, F2, and the global peaks have a tendency of upward shift. These are also much
flatter than those for clear vowels (Tartter 1989). The spectral tilts are also flattened
compared to the clean vowels. The intended pitch by a talker does not correspond to
a speciﬁc formant frequency (Konno et al. 2006).
When the air stream coming out through the glottis is not fully pulsed there is a
portion which is a steady flow. If the passage is narrow and the velocity is strong
enough turbulence is created. This is the aspiration noise component additional to
the turbulence created by the oscillation of mucosal cover over the rigid muscles of
the vocal chords. The later turbulence is associated also with normal vowels in the
form of random perturbations namely jitter, shimmer and HNR/Complexity per-
turbation (Dutta et al. 2003). This additional noise is characteristic of murmured
vowels (Klatt and Klatt 1990; Hillenbrand et al. 1994; Stevens 2000; Ladefoged
and Antananzas-Barroso 1985) and may be assessed using a band-cut ﬁlter at about
F3. In fact this noise may actually replace harmonic excitation of higher formants.
The aspiration noise would be referred to as ‘N’ in the following sections.
1.5 Aspirated Vowels 25
In the production of murmured vowels there is an acoustic coupling with the
trachea (Fant et al. 1972). The acoustic effects of tracheal coupling on the normal
transfer function of the vocal tract for a vowel include possible addition of poles
(formants) and zeros (antiformants) associated with the tracheal and lung systems.
This causes loss of energy in the vocal tract (Stevens and Hanson 1994) due to the
resistance of the yielding walls of the vocal tract, and heat conduction and frictional
losses at the walls. Thus a comparison between the total energy of a murmured
vowel with that of an adjoining clean vowel, if there is one, may be an effective
indicator. Cross-linguistic investigations of phonation types generally show that
breathy phonation is associated with a decrease in overall acoustic intensity in many
languages including Gujarati (Fischer-Jorgensen, 1967; Thongkum 1988). This
ﬁnding is, however, not universal. Wayland and Jongman (2003) for example found
that breathy vowels in Javanese are associated with an increase in overall acoustic
intensity. The ratio of energy of the steady state of murmur to that of the adjoining
vowel will be denoted by ‘E’ henceforth.
During the production of breathy phonation, to allow the vocal folds to vibrate
while they stay relatively far apart, the vocal folds have to be relatively less taut.
Thus, the fundamental frequency of a breathy vowel is expected to be lower than
that of a clear vowel. This expectation was borne out in Javanese and Green Mong
(Wayland and Jongman 2003; Andruski and Ratliff 2000). This may also explain
why breathy phonation appears to be consistently associated with lowered tone in
many languages reviewed earlier (Hombert et al. 1979). It therefore seems rea-
sonable to view the difference of the fundamental frequency of the murmur segment
and the adjoining clean vowel as an indicator of murmur.
Not much information is available on the values of the ﬁrst two formant fre-
quencies for murmured vowels though measurements of F1 bandwidth is said to
provide an indirect indication of murmurs (Stevens and Hanson 1994). However for
the whispered vowel the lower formant frequencies are known to be slightly higher
than those of the modal vowel (Pandit 1954). It therefore seems necessary to
examine the ﬁrst two formant frequencies for the aforesaid aspirated vowels in
comparison to those of the adjoining clear vowels.
The round near-sinusoidal shape of breathy glottal waveforms is responsible for
a relatively high amplitude of the ﬁrst harmonic (H1) and relatively weak upper
harmonics. However, in order to assess whether there is an increase in the H1
amplitude it must be compared with some reference. The amplitude of H2 for this
purpose has been suggested (Hillenbrand et al. 1994; Hillenbrand and Houde 1996;
Bickley 1982). Hanson (1995) reported that for breathy phonation the glottal
conﬁguration is adjusted in such a way that a larger open quotient results, while rate
of decrease of airflow at glottal closure remains nearly the same allowing an
increase in the difference between H1 and H2. A spectral analysis of H1 amplitude
relative to that of H2 for !Xoo and Gujarati vowels by Bickley (1982) revealed that
the amplitude of H1 was higher than the amplitude of the adjacent H2. Klatt and
Klatt (1990) noticed H1/H2 amplitude differences between naturally produced
breathy and clear word pairs is around 6 dB for Gujarati and 9.7 dB for !Xoo data.
26 1 Vowels, Glides and Diphthongs
Enhanced H1 amplitude in the spectra of breathy voice signals has been observed
by a number of investigators.
Vowels are produced by glottal pressure pulses ﬁnally shaped by the resonance
of the supra-glottal cavities. This is a sort of repetitive forced vibration of a res-
onating system. The shape of the resulting signal is determined by the shape of the
forcing pressure pulse at the beginning and when the pulse dies out the resonating
system takes control. During this time the signal decays at a rate determined pri-
marily by the damping factor of the resonating system if it is isolated from any
source of energy. This is so for clear vowels when glottis is fully closed. However
for murmurs the glottis is never fully closed and therefore the coupling of the
sub-glottal structure with oral cavity is likely to increase the damping. This increase
in damping would cause the decay to be faster. On the other hand there is a
possibility of deriving energy for the signal from the glottal air flow which would
tend to slower the decay of the signal in a period. Thus the decay of the signal in the
wave form in a period of vowel utterances can be an acoustic feature worth
investigation for examining breathiness in a vowel pronunciation.
1.5.2 Methodology
The aspirated vowels are found to occur profusely when there is the character [h] in
a word as reported (Mistry 1997; Pandit 1954; Masica 1991) for some other Indian
languages. Therefore, for the present study 37 SCB words, embedded in a neutral
carrier sentence, with /h/ in the syllable are taken from the speech corpus of
CDAC-Kolkata. Of these, there are 21 words where /h/ is word-initial the rest are
word -medial. The sentences were spoken by 7 male and 7 female informants in the
age group of 19–45 years. Only 257 samples could be used for analysis after
rejecting the instances of unclear pronunciations and short duration (<30 ms) of the
steady states of /h/.
As already mentioned aspiration noise mainly introduces additional energy at the
high frequency end and a standard way is to compare energy balance using F3
region as the boundary. For SCB the F2 rarely exceeds 2.8 kHz. Therefore, for the
present study this is used as the boundary for spectral balance. For this purpose of
ﬁltering and energy measurement more or less the steady spectral region of the
segment, murmur or adjoining clean vowel, is used. Figure 1.22 presents an
example with the word /bɐɦɐdur/ where /ɦ/ is in word medial position. The portions
inside the vertical lines indicate the nearly steady regions used for acoustic
measurements.
A sharp band-cut ﬁlter with −30 dB attenuation with cut-off at 2.8 kHz has been
used for measuring the high (h) and low (l) frequency energy content in a segment
(Fig. 1.23). As mentioned earlier the amount of aspiration noise ‘N’ is represented
by the ratio h/l expressed in dB.
As said before the difference of the signal energy between a clean vowel and the
aspirated vowel that is another indicator of the breathy character. Fortunately in
1.5 Aspirated Vowels 27
almost all the cases studied here /ɦ/ has the colour of the succeeding clear vowel.
Therefore, it is easier to select the required segments for total energy comparison
(Fig. 1.23). The parameter ‘E’ is given by the ratio of the total energy of the
selected segment of /ɦ/ to that of the adjoining vowel expressed in dB.
As mentioned earlier the difference between the fundamental frequencies of the
murmur vowel segment and the adjoining clean vowel may be studied as a cue for
murmur. This difference is deﬁned here as Df0 = ɦf0 − vf0 where ɦf0, vf0 respec-
tively denotes the average fundamental frequency of the steady states of [ɦ] seg-
ment and the adjoining vowel segment.
The amplitudes of the ﬁrst and second harmonics (H1, H2) are measured from
the spectrum section at the steady state of the voiced region (Fig. 1.24). For
comparative assessment of these amplitude measures, the steady states for [ɦ] and
the adjoining clean vowel segments were used.
The spectral tilt is a very general term and has been used for different regions in
the spectra, e.g. this may represent amplitude of F1 or F2 with respect to the f0 or
even comparing H1 and H2. For the present study spectral tilt represent the tilt of
the full spectra from f0 to 10 kHz. It is measured by taking the spectrum section of
the whole of the steady state and then the trend line for the whole spectra.
Figure 1.25 shows the average spectral plot of the selected nearly steady state of the
segments of three different types of vowel namely, a clean vowel, a murmured
vowel and a whispered vowel selected from the present SCB data base. The
individual plots are vertically shifted for the ease of comparison. One can easily

visualize the differences. The equations relate to the corresponding trend lines. The
coefﬁcient of x gives the value of slope. This is used to represent spectral tilt for the
present purpose. Formants and formant like structures are indicated by circles in the
ﬁgure.
As vowels are produced by repetitive excitation of supra-glottal cavities by a
series of pressure pulses coming from the glottis they exhibit a decaying periodic
structure. In most cases it is not difﬁcult to segment the signal into the periodic

structures. For the determination of periodic decay the following procedure is
adopted:
1. The absolute value of the signal, which folds up the negative portions of the
signal, is used for the purpose.
2. Each period is amplitude normalized at a pre-ﬁxed value say 10,000.
3. For each period a line is drawn which just covers the signal.
4. The slope of the cover is taken as an estimate of the decay.
5. Relatively steady states of the vowels are used.
Figure 1.26 shows the clear vowel signal and Fig. 1.27 shows the corresponding
signal with negative parts folded up and amplitude normalized for each period. The
dashed lines show the cover of this transformed signal the slope of which is taken as
the estimate of the decay factor for each period. The covers are drawn manually.
1.6 Results and Discussions
There are 257 usable signal ﬁles from 21 words with character [h] spoken by 14
informants of both sexes. Of all these only 7 (<3%) has been found to be pure
sibilants. Clear vowels are characterized by a substantively unobstructed passage
through the supra-glottal pathway as against consonants which are characterized
either by substantive obstruction or constriction. These seven records are heard by
the author as either murmured or whispered vowels. In fact these are heard as a
variant of a vowel like sound with the same colour as that of the adjoining vowel,
succeeding ones in most cases. In Bangla, [হ] generally manifests itself as different
classes of spectra each representing closely one of the seven vowels. It seems
contrived to consider phones having different spectral structures, which could be
distinctly categorized in different categories and heard as sounds which are cate-
gorically different, as a single phoneme. In this context one needs to examine
carefully the acoustic segments representing the character [হ], in SCB, in terms of
the signatures known to characterize murmured vowels in other languages.
Fig. 1.26 Example of a clear vowel signal
30 1 Vowels, Glides and Diphthongs
Figures 1.28 and 1.29 presents examples of the acoustic picture of these sounds
representing the [h]. All the four formants (represented by solid lines of different
shade of grey) are clearly visible and consistent with those in the succeeding vowel
regions. As we shall see later, there are certain acoustical structures which strongly
favour [ɦ] to be considered in the group of murmured vowels, as has been reported
for some other Indian languages mentioned in Sect. 1.5, instead of glottal fricative.
These are presence of strong fundamentals and distinct formant structures which
closely correlate with the succeeding vowel. The waveforms appear to be similar to
vowels (mostly the following ones) with some high frequency perturbations added
and amplitude lowered.
Figure 1.30 presents the frequency distributions of the aspiration noise N for the
[ɧ] segments and the adjoining clear vowels. Aspiration noise is seen to be clearly
higher for [ɦ] segments. The modes are well separated. The cross-over point is at
−12 dB. The fact that with this boundary, 225 (90%) out of 249 adjoining vowel
segments, fall in the category of clear vowels clearly indicates that N is a good
indicator of murmurs. Again with this boundary 182 out of 249 [ɧ] segments (73%)
fall out of the category of clear vowels. These may be considered as aspirated
vowels which, in isolation, are heard by the author as either murmur or whisper. Of
the 20 [ɧ] segments for which N is positive, which means that the energy content

above 2.8 kHz is more than that below, one is murmur, two are sibilants and the
rest are whispers.
Average power of a murmur with respect to that of the adjoining vowel is
reported (see Sect. 1.5.2) as a cue for murmur. Figure 1.31 shows the distribution
of E, the ratio of the average energy of the steady state of murmured segment to that
of the adjoining vowel. All murmurs are found to be weaker with only one
exception. The mode occurs at −20 dB indicating this cue to be quite robust.
Figure 1.32 presents the distributions of differences H1-H2 for the murmur
segment and the adjoining vowel segment. For SCB the two distributions appear to
be equivalent. Both are symmetric with the mode near about 0 (3–6 dB) looks like a
normal distribution. The standard deviation for both of the distribution is about
10.5 dB and is reasonable. Thus unlike Gujarati and !Xoo (see Sect. 1.5.1) H1 and
H2 does not show discriminatory property in case of SCB murmur against clear
vowels.
Figure 1.33 shows the distribution of differences in f0 (adjoining
vowel − murmur). The f0 is lower for murmured vowel except only for 14 samples,

which may be considered as negligible. The distribution is slightly skewed with the
mode around 23 Hz. This is about 10% of the average value of f0 of the clear
vowels in the sample set. The distribution is drawn with 208 pairs. For the rest
murmur segments f0 could not be ascertained with conﬁdence. Thus the expectation
that murmurs have lowered f0 is consistently vindicated though the average increase
is not very high.
Figure 1.34 presents the frequency distribution of spectral tilts of murmurs and
clear vowels along with their differences (murmur − vowel). It may be seen that the
distributions for murmur and adjoining vowel show similar skewed nature with the
mode for murmur shifted slightly to the right indicating expected increased negative
tilt in general. However the shift of 0.0003 is small, only about 10% of the modal
values. It is expected that the spectral structure of a murmured vowel would be
influenced by the adjoining vowel. If so the slope of the tilts over different pairs
would show good correlation. Unexpectedly the correlation for all data when
pooled together is very low only 0.38. It seemed necessary to look into the issue
more closely. It is found that the pairs could be clustered to improve correlation. In
fact these 246 pairs may be clustered using the differences in the slopes for the pair.
The clustering attempt shows that the pairs of segments with difference of slope
 0.00088 fall into one class (say A containing 116 pairs) and the rest in the other
group (say B containing 130 pairs) (Fig. 1.35). Figure 1.35 shows how the pairs of
murmured vowels and the adjoining clear vowels tend to group into two separate
regions. Though there is some small overlap they are linearly aligned one above the
other. Within each group the tilts of murmurs are seen to be strongly correlated in
the clusters (0.69 for class A and 0.74 for class B) with those of the adjoining
vowels. So far we have been treating all aspirated vowels as murmured vowels. The
aforesaid classiﬁcation reveals an interesting grouping. On listening to these signals
by the author himself the two groups of signal produced distinct perceptual dif-
ference of the general quality of the aspirated vowels. 81% of these [h] in class A
are heard as whispered vowels rest are murmured vowels. Similarly 74% of the [h]
in class B are heard as murmured vowels rest are whispered vowels.

murmured and adjoining clear vowel used in Fig. 1.34 is 105. It may be seen that in
general both F1 and F2 are higher for murmured vowels. In fact F2 is higher for 81%
of the samples while the corresponding ﬁgure for F1 is 58%. For Fig. 1.35 the
number of pairs for the whispered vowels is 135. Here also both for F1 (82%
samples) and F2 (81% samples) formant frequencies are higher for the whispered
vowels. However when we look at the mode of distributions we ﬁnd that in most
cases the shifts are quite small e.g. for murmur these are 10% and 8% respectively
for F1 and F2. For whispers the corresponding ﬁgures are 10% for F1 and 2% for F2.
Thus aspirated vowels in SCB show consistent raising of lower formant frequen-
cies, albeit by a small amount.
Table 1.6 gives the mean and standard deviations (SD) for the ﬁrst two formant
frequencies of the murmured and whispered vowels. ‘n’ indicates the number of
samples in the category. The SD values marked bold indicated reasonably narrow
spread. The number of samples in the categories [e, æ, i, and o] are quite small and
therefore no comparison would be meaningful. These just indicate that these vowels
were also found in the samples available from the corpus. The formants for vowels
[ɔ] and [ɐ] are found to be close for the two categories murmurs and whispers. It
may be noted that all seven vowels of SCB have the corresponding ones in both

The slope of the periodic decay is the new parameter investigated here.
Table 1.7 shows the means and standard deviations of the slopes of the decay for all
periods in a selected segment. Average number of periods in a segment is 11 for
murmurs and 9 for clear vowels. Altogether 26 pairs of segments have been
selected from the database using the following criteria:
(1) Each segment of a pair must have at least 40 ms of reasonably steady state.
(2) The murmured segment should be clear enough for unambiguous periodic
segmentation.

The ﬁrst and the last column in the table represent the category of the segment as
heard by the author; ‘n’ represents the number of periods in the corresponding
segment. ‘D’ is the normalized excess of decay expressed in percentage for clear
vowel over the murmured and calculated as D = 100*(mean clear − mean murmur)/
(mean clear + mean murmur).
It may be seen that the value of D is positive in most cases indicating generally
that the periodic decay is less for murmurs. Only 3 pairs out of 26 show contrary
result. The average value of D is 46% indicating that the decrease of the decay rate
for murmurs is quite signiﬁcant. This probably means that the supply of energy
from open glottis overrides the possible increase of the damping due to the
inclusion of the sub-glottal structure into the resonating system. SD represents the
spread of the decay slope around the mean value. A comparison of the SDs with
respect to the means for each pair reveals that the spread is considerably high for

murmured vowels. On an average it is almost four times larger. This increase in the
spread is however expected as in case of the murmurs the vocal folds are said to be
more lax causing irregularity in the system to increase.
1.7 Conclusions
Altogether 257 samples of [h] from spoken words were examined. These are taken
from 37 words spoken by 7 male and 7 female informants. These may be con-
sidered as fairly good samples for having a fare idea of the nature of [h] sound in
SCB. Of these 257 samples only 7 are found to be sibilants. The rest appear to
consist of 105 murmured and 135 whispered vowels. Contrary to the traditional
representation of the sound produced by the grapheme [হ] the study ﬁrmly reveals
that this grapheme in Bangla is associated with aspirated vowels the vowel quality
of which is normally that of the preceding clear vowel. The study ﬁrmly reveals the
existence of murmured vowels in Bangla corresponding to each of the seven clear
vowels.
The characteristic features may be summarized as the following.
• Aspiration noise N is seen to be clearly higher for [ɦ] segments and is a good
indicator of murmurs. Also when N is positive, i.e. the spectral energy above
2.8 kHz is more than that below, the vowels are aspirated.
• The lower value of the average power of a murmur/whisper with respect to that
of the adjoining vowel is a robust cue for aspirated vowels.
• The differences between the amplitudes of H1 and H2 do not show any dis-
crimination between clear vowels and aspirated vowels.
• The differences in f0 (adjoining vowel − murmur) is another robust cue for
discrimination.
• Though a general trend of increase in the ﬁrst two formant frequencies are
strongly evident the amount is quite small.
• Spectral tilt in the average spectra of the whole segment seems to be a good cue
for differentiating aspirated vowels from clear vowels.
• The difference between the spectral tilt of the aspirated vowel and the adjoining
clear vowels may be used to differentiate whispered from murmured vowels.
• Strong influences of the adjoining vowel on the murmured as well as whispered
vowels are indicated by strong correlation of the spectral tilt.
• Periodic decay, the new parameter proposed is a robust cue for distinguishing
murmured from clean vowels. This is signiﬁcantly faster for murmurs.
38 1 Vowels, Glides and Diphthongs
1.8 Diphthongs and Semi-Vowels
The other major phonemes in the quasi periodic group of speech sounds are the
semi-vowels and the diphthongs. Semi-vowels form a subclass of approximants
(Crystal 2003). Semi-vowels, by deﬁnition, contrast with vowels by being
non-syllabic. In addition, they are usually shorter than vowels. Nevertheless,
semi-vowels may be phonemically equivalent with vowels in some situations.
Diphthongs are not just a combination of two vowels. Most importantly, diphthongs
are fully contained in the syllable nucleus (Schane 1995). While a semi-vowel or
glide is restricted to the syllable boundaries (either the onset or the coda), this often
manifests itself phonetically by a greater degree of constriction (Padgett 2007).
These deﬁnitions are linguistic in nature and therefore selection of words is made
by a linguist. In this process the linguist uses his own concept of the representative
pronunciation of the word. Unfortunately a linguist is a learned person loaded with
intricate linguistic knowledge. Such a person’s concept of correct utterance could
be quite different from that of a common native speaker. In this sense a collection of
corpus from speech of native listeners may be different at times when we look only
for these conceptual representative words. The concept of syllables is word speciﬁc,
and words are semantic units. But in continuous speech word boundaries are not
clearly marked always. For example let us take the simple spoken query in Bangla,
‘ɐmɐrmisƫikh
ɐben’. If we do not have the supra-segmental information, this utter-
ance has at least two meanings. One is ‘would you eat my sweetmeat’. The other is
‘would you eat mango and sweetmeat’. In the ﬁrst case the syllable division would
be ‘ɐ/mɐr/mis/ƫi/kh
ɐ/ben’. In the second case it would be ‘ɐm/ɐr/mis/ƫi/kh
ɐ/ben’.
Author did not have access to any study in Bangla to indicate whether in real speech
syllable deﬁnition follows the same rules as in the case of isolated words. Within
these constraints the choice of data base for the study on semi-vowels and diph-
thongs are done. We, therefore, selected all words in the CDAC corpus which is
likely to contain one of these phones in addition to the wordlist supplied by the
linguists.
The psychoacoustic feature that separates these sounds from the vowels is that
the changing spectral patterns reflected in formant movements are innately cogni-
tive. The point of the dynamic movement being cognitive needs a little elaboration.
Figure 1.38 shows some nonsense words. Let us concentrate on the last syllables in
each of them. The dashed double arrowhead is used to represent the vowel as
deﬁned normally. However, in reality it is not so simple. The solid double
arrowhead represents the dynamic movement in the resonance structures. These are
heard as the corresponding consonants. So they are cognitive but not as a vowel.
Only the part of the signal which has a relatively steady formant structure is
cognitively a vowel.
In the case of diphthongs this movement indicates the weaker vowel for which
the steady state is absent or very short, while in the case of glides the transition
alone is the acoustic as well as the cognitive signature.
1.8 Diphthongs and Semi-Vowels 39
1.8.1 Diphthongs
The numbers of diphthongs in Bangla cited in literatures vary signiﬁcantly. Suniti
Kumar Chattopadhay (SKC) (Chatterji 1926) cited 25 diphthongs whereas Abdul
Hai (AH) (Hai 1989) listed 31 diphthongs, of which 19 are regular and 12 are
irregular. Pabitra Sarkar (PS) (Sarkar 1985) has given the number as only 17.
Table 1.8 shows the uniﬁed list of diphthongs. In this table the phonetic repre-
sentation follows these authors’ descriptions.
Figure 1.39 shows the spectrographic view of a Bangla word containing a
diphthong. In this ﬁgure, D1 denotes the duration of steady state of 1st vowel [o],
D3 denotes the duration of the transitory portion between two vowels [ou] and D2
denotes the duration of steady state of 2nd vowel [u]. Formants automatically
detected by Wavesurfer are indicated by curved lines of different colors.
1.8.2 Acoustic Signatures
As already mentioned the semi-vowels and diphthongs reveal characteristic tran-
sitions of acoustical parameters contained in the quasi-periodic acoustic waves.
Segments corresponding to each word containing semi-vowels and diphthongs had
been extracted manually from the corpus [CDAC, 49]. The durations of the steady
states of initial and ﬁnal vowels, along with that of transitions are also manually
extracted from the spectrogram. Figure 1.40 presents 3D spectrographs of 25
Fig. 1.38 Formant movements in VCV syllables

different diphthongs. Each one of them reveals the strong characteristic transitions.
As we could not ﬁnd any word containing [æi] and [iɔ] in SCB so data for these two
diphthongs could not be included. Further it was noticed that some Bangla words

It appears that the corresponding authors took some liberty in presenting a diphthong as
combination of one vowel and a glide instead of generally accepted presentation with two vowels

Fig. 1.39 Spectrographic view of Bangla word (/tʃouko/)
Fig. 1.40 Spectrogram of Bangla diphthongs
42 1 Vowels, Glides and Diphthongs
contain vowel pairs which though not listed in Table 1.8 need to be examined to see
whether they have the acoustic characteristic of a diphthong. These include pairs [ɐe],
[æa], [ɔɐ], [ejo], [ii], [oj], and [uu]. The spectrograms of the diphthongs [uu], [oo] and
[ii] as well as of [ɔɐ], [ɐu], [æɐ], will be discussed later along with other glides.
From the individual spectrograms in Fig. 1.40 one can apparently see that the
ﬁrst vowel is weak for ui, uɐ, ue, oɐ, oe, ɔe, ɐi, ei, iɐ, io and the second vowel is
weak for oi, ou, ɔo, ɐe, æi, eɐ, eu. However these are ﬁrst impression only. The
weaker vowel would be properly identiﬁed from the acoustic parameter later on.
Lehiste and Peterson (1961) suggested representation of diphthongs by super-
scripting the weak vowel.
1.8.3 Results and Discussions
Table 1.9 presents the average values and the standard deviations of the durations
of the steady states of the related two vowels and those of the in-between V-V
transition for all the combinations under study. The standard deviation show rea-
sonable variation expected from a natural source. The data is not large enough for a
formal expression on the statistics. The ﬁgures in parenthesis give the percentage of
duration of the item to that of the whole phone. The entries are organised in
increasing order of the duration of the ﬁrst target vowels.
One interesting point that revealed from the data is that in Bangla diphthongs
except for [oe], [iɔ] and [æo] both the vowels have signiﬁcantly long duration to be
heard as a clear vowel if we consider 40 millisecond duration to be minimum
requirement of cognition of a vowel. They also have long duration for transition.
However traditionally these are referred as single syllabic nucleus.
However if we see the relative duration then percentage of the transitional duration
to the total duration of a nucleus the average for Bangla is 42%. This is quite close to
those reported for American English (Lehiste and Peterson 1961). For diphthongs
[au], [aɪ] and [ɔɪ] in American English the transition duration is about 41% of the total
duration while the durations of other vowels are around 36% and 23% respectively for
the ﬁrst and second target vowels. Very high proportional duration has been noticed
for Romanian diphthongs [ja], [ea], [wa] and [oa]. The transition duration is reported
to be rather large (70–80% of the total duration) (Chitoran 2002).
Some of the aforesaid diphthongs in cited references like [uo], and [ɔo]
respectively in words like (th
uo), and নয়া (nɔa) have almost equal percentage of
durations for the three constituent segments namely, the two vowel and the inter-
mediate transition. The durations of the segments are all more than 65 ms each and,
therefore much above the cognitive threshold. Yet they are reported to be a single
nucleus and considered as a diphthong. It is surprising that [th
uo] and [nɔa] cannot
be divided each into two syllables namely, [th
u-wo] and [nɔ-ja], instead has to be
represented as [th
uo
] and [nɔa].
We can use the durational values to prune the aforesaid list given in Table 1.8. If
we assume that a pair of vowels can be considered as a diphthong only when at

least one of them is weak and below the threshold of cognition and the cognitive
threshold of duration to be taken to be at least 40 ms. then only 22 pairs from the
aforesaid list qualify. Of these 8 have transitional duration higher than 80 ms which
is much more than required for cognition of it as a semi-vowel. Thus the acoustic
data suggest that of all the vowel pairs given in Table 1.9 only 14 qualiﬁes
acoustically the conditions required for a diphthong. These are presented in
Table 1.10 (ﬁgures within parenthesis represent the standard deviations). Of these
10 (in bold script) matches with the list cited by PS (see Table 1.8).
Furthermore a large number of the V-V combinations particularly, [ɔe], [ia], [ea],
[æe], [oa], [eo], [æo], [uo] and [ɔo] in the list have very large transition duration
indicative of a glide. Listening experiments need to be done to ascertain their
character.
1.9 Semi-Vowels
A glide or a semi-vowel is a vocalic syllable nucleus consisting of a single target
vowel. During the production of a glide the tongue forms a constriction just wide
enough not to cause turbulent airflow. The associated tongue movement is com-
paratively slow and causes formant transitions to or from the target vowel a cog-
nizable event by itself. The duration of movement is comparable to that of the
target. Cognitively the sound is heard as a gliding sound.

1.8 Diphthongs and Semi-Vowels 45
Traditionally it is believed that Bangla has three semi-vowels or glides namely /j/,
/y/ and /w/ (Hai 1989). These pertain to Bengali words and have characteristic
signatures of movement in the spectral domain. However if we take into account
continuous speech such glides may also occur at the word juncture when the pre-
ceding word ends in a vowel and the succeeding word also has a vowel in the
beginning. In such cases when the two vowels are same a pitch glide is very common
(Datta et al. 1989). A question may be raised at this juncture as to why should one
bother about a speech sound which is not a part of the word and therefore not a
phoneme. However as this is a work on acoustics which relates to spoken language
not to textual language one has to be aware of all speech events which have cognitive
connotation while knowing well what one is looking at. As has already been pointed
out earlier, that words in speech do not consistently leave special markers for a
word-ending. In fact the recent trends in spoken language processing is not to be
obsessed with the abstract unit called word but to give more emphasis on what is
usually referred to as prosodic words. These are usually small phrases having con-
sistent prosodic markers at the signal level. In any case any additional knowledge
cannot be harmful.
One may note here that for studying the acoustic signatures one need to use
semi-vowel in all possible context available in the spoken database. We note that in
combination of the type vowel-semi-vowel-vowel normally occurring in lexicon the
purported semi-vowel could be a syllabic boundary. It could also be part of a
diphthong. The present purpose is to study the acoustic signature of transitory
movements of acoustic parameters of certain phones without in any way interfering
with the cognitive evaluation of erudite linguists. Such studies have earlier been
reported in other languages which, no doubt, augmented our knowledge of acoustic
phonetics. A large number of spoken words were carefully examined to select 202
samples where glides are heard clearly. As this data comes from 10 speakers of both
sexes and as the data was not large enough to have a speaker speciﬁc analysis the
data were pooled together for a general analysis.
1.9.1 Acoustic Signatures
The general acoustic signature of a glide is a long transition either preceded or
followed by cognizable vowel. The following acoustic signatures were reported
(Ganguly et al. 1999) for glides in SCB:
1. Existence of virtual target ([kɐjɐ])
2. Single target vowel ([koetʃi], [keukeƫɐ]
3. Two targets connected by a transition ([gɐonɐ], [sɔodɐ]
4. An additional short target ([pɐj]
5. Pitch glide ([beje], [peje].
46 1 Vowels, Glides and Diphthongs
Figure 1.41 presents the examples of acoustic structures of glides in different
vowel contexts. In the ﬁgure glides are represented by ‘x’ instead of their traditional
symbols. Virtual targets have been seen for combinations [ɐxɐ], [ɐxo], [ɐxu], [ɔxɐ],
[ɔxɔ], [oxu], [oxo], [exɐ] and [ɔxɐ]. The actual symbols for this will be presented
later in Table 1.11. Of these the last two are when F2 goes low and the rest are when
F2 goes high. The targets are said to be virtual when they are not heard as vowels
though in the spectrograms they present very distinctive features of vowels. The
other interesting point to note that in general virtual targets are created when the
two end vowels have very close frequency for the second formant. It is quite
possible that these are generated to provide additional support to the cognitive
mechanism for the new phonetic event. Figures for combinations [ɐx], [æx], [ɔx],
[ox] and [xɐ] are examples of glides associated with single target vowel similarly
[æxɐ], [oxo], [cxo] and [ɔxɐ] may be considered as glides between two target
vowels.
Fig. 1.41 Spectrogram of Bangla semi-vowels in different vowel contexts
1.9 Semi-Vowels 47
It is also desirable to attempt at ﬁxing the symbols for the glides with reference
to the spectral signatures presented above. It may be noted that spectral signatures
of all examined words are not presented above. Only one word from each group is
selected as an example. If we consider that high F2 is a signature of palatalization as
against low F2 for a signature for velar constriction at the virtual targets the glides
represented in Fig. 1.41 may be represented in Table 1.11. Also if the adjoining
vowels are rounded ones it is logical to select the symbol for labial
counterpart. Using this approach one ﬁnds the existence of all the four semi-vowels
in SCB. However this categorization is only tentative and there is a need to conduct
listening experiments involving phoneticians to ascertain the veracity of such
categorization.
The study reveals some gliding sounds in case of some of the Vowel-Vowel
combinations consisting of same vowel like [ii], [oo], [uu] and [ee] respectively in
words [dii] (meaning I give), [ʃoo] meaning lie down), [kuu] (meaning call of bird
cuckoo), [tʃee] (meaning after seeing) where gliding sounds are clearly heard. In
such cases only the duration of pitch glide is noted, which is shown in Fig. 1.42.
The pitch contour is shown by black line. The continuously changing value of the
pitch causes the gliding sensation though there is no signiﬁcant change in spectra
during this glide. The duration was noted to be long enough to cause the glide
sensation. This phenomenon was found to occur also at word juncture e.g., [ma
amar] (meaning mother mine) (Ganguly et al. 1999).
1.9.2 Duration
Tables 1.12 and 1.13 present the durations of different acoustic segments of the
traditionally reported single vowel and semi-vowel combination, and
vowel-semi-vowel-vowel combination respectively. It may be seen from the table
that the duration of transitions representing glides are generally longer than the
target vowels. In fact in most of the cases they are large enough to be a cognitively
relevant entity. It may be noticed that [w] has a comparatively shorter transition
than [j] but still it is large enough to be cognitively relevant and is larger than the
vowel duration.
In Table 1.13 the virtual targets are estimated on the basis of average F1 and F2
values. In general the transition is much larger than the targets. However, for [ɔjɔ]
and [ojo] the ﬁrst targets show very short durations. Like in the instances in V-j

combinations, in all instances of V-j-V combinations the durations of transitions
seem to deﬁne glides without doubt.
1.10 Discussions
Standard colloquial Bengali commonly known as Bangla is now used in formal and
cultured mass communication throughout West Bengal. The study of phonetics in it
has a long history, the early ones being purely subjective. These represented
phonetics of SCB as imitated by erudite scholars of whatever nativity they may be.
It is natural that these would be very subjective and useful for scholarly studies.
However in the present era where phonetics is the most important part of tech-
nology development in voiced communication it is imperative to capture acoustic
phonetics of speech sounds, which represents the native speaking as closely as
possible. Not only that these have to be represented in terms of the physics of sound

so that measures may be developed for each of them for the use of technology. This
development is not an ornamental ideational exercise. It has ﬁrm need for the
society where literacy is not much above 70% and the functional literacy rate is
even much lower. The estimate of functional literacy is no common task and usually
such reports are not above serious controversies. In general one can assume that not
more than 40–50% people in India can read a general informative passage and glean
the needed knowledge content out of it. Unfortunately the rest i.e. the so handi-
capped people consists of the population engaged in production of mass consum-
ables. They need to be brought under the knowledge resources needed for
upgrading their standard of life as well as bringing efﬁciency in production. The
potential of speech technology lies here. It is now possible to bring knowledge to
these people of India. The instruments for oral communication with computers
through speech mode are ready. This consists of two separate engines: (a) a
computer-man communication engine commonly known as text to speech synthesis
engine (TTS) and (b) a man-machine communication engine called automatic
speech recognition (ASR) engine. Fortunately indigenously developed TTS engines
are now available. One may refer to ESNOLA based speech synthesizer
(Choudhury 2006) and ESOLA based engine (Das Mandal 2007). A new engine
called Manner Based Lexically Driven (MBLD) engine is developed for isolated
word recognition (Das Mandal 2007). But these require language speciﬁc knowl-
edge modules. This knowledge has two components, semiotics and acoustics.
Again the semiotic knowledge, consisting of syntax, grammar, pragmatics, is
mostly available for Bangla. But these are mainly based on textual language. To
what extent these conform to spoken dialect has not been investigated. One would
expect considerable deviations and therefore needs necessary modiﬁcations to ﬁt
the need of technology. Fortunately the acoustic knowledge is being overhauled for
consumption by the technology. The subjective abstract knowledge of phones and
their contextual interactions need to be precisely and objectively speciﬁed. It has to
be ﬁeld dependent not simply an ideational exercise.
This means a new paradigm of research using scientiﬁc tools of measurements
and the technology of statistics to choose representative from a collection of large
number of data has to be ushered in. Obviously one expects some changes in the
ﬁnal representation. In India this has began late last century. The present work
though primarily a recent study with collection of contemporary speech data also
includes the results of earlier work conducted in the country. An attempt has been
made above to provide purely objective data base for use in the technology. This,
we feel, may also be useful for subjective ideational review of the existing
knowledge. Attention may be drawn to two new ﬁndings in the present work. These
are the existence of aspirated vowels to replace the present linguistic gross notion of
sound corresponding to the grapheme [h] and a new set of glides including the
inclusion of pitch glides. One may also like to draw attention to the observed new
set of diphthongs which has a ﬁrm acoustic footing and may help in developing the
TTS and ASR engines.
A notable addition is the use of a very recent development which allows one to
use objectively collected data, namely the ﬁrst two formant frequencies and the
1.10 Discussions 51
fundamental frequency, to accurately estimate the perceptual subjective catego-
rization of vowels. Interestingly this produced a more consistent and compact
distribution of vowels in parametric plane. This has strong potential in automatic
speech recognition apart from being an example of interaction between hard and
soft sciences.

Consonants
2.1 Introduction
Bangla consonants are broadly classiﬁed into plosives, affricates, fricatives, lateral,
taps, and trill according to their manners of production. Again in each of these
manner-based categories there could be categorization on the basis of the place of
articulation. All these traditional categorizations of consonants in SCB are shown in
Table 2.1 with example words for consonants in initial, medial and ﬁnal positions,
as are available in literatures (Chatterji 1926; Hai 1989).
The aforesaid categorization was done by expert phoneticians and linguists.
However to suit the need of technology, objective quantiﬁable acoustic
parameters as exists in today’s speech sound is imperative. Fortunately, in recent
times, with the advent of technology it is possible to objectively and quantiﬁably
determine the manners and places of articulation of a particular consonant uttered a
number of times by a number of speakers. Statistics allows us methodology to
select the appropriate representative. Such objective categorization is necessary for
the development of speech technology like ASR and TTS engines. As has been said
earlier in India this type of activity began in early 70s (Datta et al. 1974) in Kolkata
with the procurement of the ﬁrst Sonagraph from Kay Elemetrics. However the
work on Bangla started much later.
2.2 Experimental Procedure
Some of the instrumental approaches like signal processing tools including
extraction of spectral structures have been in use in India since 70s. The use of
spirometers, electroglottograms (EGG), palatographs, etc., is also quite old. A new
entrant in this ﬁeld is the electropalatograph (EPG). This is now in use in India.
While the spirometers and electroglottograms are used for detecting the manner

based categorization the palatographs are used for determining the place of artic-
ulation, where tongue is the moving articulator. Video capture is used primarily for
determining lip closure. The advancement in spectral processing and interpretation
has made use of spirometers and EGG important for pathological investigation,
though has become replaceable for acoustic phonetic analysis for two obvious
reasons. One is that wearing the electrodes is not only inconvenient but also makes
the normal informants somewhat tense. Therefore one cannot really examine
acoustics of free normal speech. The other is that spectral processing is very reli-
able, fast and can be done offline even on previously recorded speech.
In the present report Electropalatograph (EPG) in conjunction with video camera
has been used to determine the place of articulation of a large number of conso-
nants. For acoustic signatures spectral structure has been used. The EPG system is
used to objectively ascertain the place of contact made by the tongue with the hard
palate and video camera is used to determine if the closure is made at the lips. For
extracting the spectral information commercially available soft-ware packages like
Cool-Edit Pro and Wave surfer has been used.
The EPG consists of a custom made palate to ﬁt the informant. This artiﬁcial
palate extends from the root of the teeth only up to the beginning of the soft palate.
The extension of the palate deep into the palate to cover velar region fully is
avoided as it would otherwise cause discomfort to the wearer even may do harm to
the soft palate. It has 62 contact points (electrodes) on the lower surface where the
tongue can make a contact. These are distributed in eight rows, which correspond to
particular articulatory regions as shown in Fig. 2.1. This palate is connected to the
EPG electronic instrumentation which produces running frames showing the points
by back squares at which a contact is made.
EPG system also records the speech signal and provides both spectral and wave
form representation (Fig. 2.2). All information are time-aligned with the EPG frame
representation. Figure 2.2 depicts the production of a plosive in V-V context with
occlusion, burst and voice onset indicated therein.
For EPG analysis the informant has to wear the false palate in his/her mouth and
hold an electrode in one hand. It takes some time for the informant to get

accustomed. There is no doubt that the system is slightly cumbrous, uncomfortable
and highly expensive in the Indian context. However, there being no other more
reliable method available for determining the place of contact of tongue and as
International Phonetics Association recommends this instrument for assuring
standardization of data this has been used for the present study.
2.3 Speech Material
For acoustic analysis of the manner of articulation of consonants, data in VCV
context was taken from the speech corpus of DIT, Kolkata [www.cdackolkata.in].
Altogether speech data of 5 speakers (2 male and 3 female) had been considered for
this study. All of them are native speakers of Standard Colloquial Bangla. They
were selected through a properly constituted selection test. The nativity was assured
using three criteria, (1) both the parents must belong to the relevant districts, (2) the
informant was reared by their parents, and (3) the education up to the higher
secondary level was through Bangla medium. The metadata of the informants is
given in Table 2.2. The words used were taken from a phonetically balanced
word-set (PBW) of about 600 words. The PBW was prepared such that as far as

practicable all necessary CVC combinations used in the language are available and
there occurrences are nearly the same. These words were embedded in a neutral
carrier sentence for reading and recording.
Furthermore natural words containing the possible CC cluster and the C at three
different positions were also added to the list. For the analysis of voiced consonants
only those VCV segments were considered in which the occlusion period shows
distinct voice bar, and similarly for unvoiced ones only those VCV segments
having no voicing in the occlusion region were considered. The number of different
VCV segments for different consonants was given in Table 2.3. For the analysis
using EPG the unit list consists of a set of nonsense VCV sequences in which V
represents the seven Bangla vowels /u/, /o/, /ɔ/, /a/, /æ/, /e/ and /i/ and C represents
all the consonants of Bangla. For stops all VC sequences for the 20 stop consonants
were added in the list.
It may be seen that for unaspirated voiced and aspirated voiced retroflex plosives
the number of data were remarkably low. In Bangla the occurrence of these con-
sonants in VCV context is somewhat rare. This is also observed in case of aspirated
unvoiced and aspirated voiced bilabial plosives. For analysis which required EPG
the appropriate recording material was read out by one male and female informant,
wearing the respective artiﬁcial sensor palates. Only one informant of each sex was
used because of logistic problem as the palates cannot be made in India. The EPG
dynamic contact information was recorded in the PC at a regular interval of 10 ms.
The acoustic signal from a microphone supplied with the instrument was recorded
at 22,050 sampling frequency 16 bits mono PCM format, synchronized with EPG
frames. The reading is limited for a maximum of 20 min duration in a session for
the convenience of the informants. Ten repetitions each of the VCV and the VC
from the aforesaid list were recorded for each speaker for the determination of place
of articulation of consonants.
2.4 Methodologies
The objective analysis of consonantal sounds can have two approaches, one is
primarily instrumental and the other uses signal processing techniques to extract
acoustical information from digitized audio signals. As has already been mentioned,
instrumental approach is not often preferred because it affects the naturalness of free

speech. It is reported that the dynamics of certain parameters like formant fre-
quencies show strong correlation with the place of articulation (Datta and
Mukherjee 2011) and is largely used in speech technology applications (Das
Mandal 2007; Choudhury 2006; Datta 1988; Datta et al. 1978a, b, 1981; Datta and
Ganguly 1981, 1985) for the categorization of plosives/affricates with respect to the
place of articulation. It may also be noted that these parameters can be reliably
extracted, using appropriate signal processing techniques, from online as well as
recorded data and therefore can represent some characteristics of free speech.
However the instrument EPG may be used to validate the description of the place of
articulation obtained through signal processing techniques. For various reasons,
mainly methodological, the categories show overlap signiﬁcant enough for this
approach for resolution of ambiguities. The EPG provides possibly the best way to
determine the place of articulation with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Moreover
the lacuna regarding the naturalness may be somewhat addressed by allowing the
informant to get accustomed with the contraption. It is hoped that with some
practice this disadvantage is mitigated to a large extent.
Therefore in the present book the primary emphasis is given on signal processing
techniques as far as acoustic parameters are concerned. For the place of articulation
the EPG is used.
2.4.1 Acoustic Analysis
The signatures for different manners of production related to voicing and aspiration
are available in both the signal domain and spectral domain presentation. Plosives
and affricates of Bangla (spɔrʃɔbɔrɲɔ),1
like all other languages of the Indo-Aryan
family, are traditionally presented in a matrix form where the columns represent
manners and rows places of articulation. These show a ﬁve-way contrast in terms of
both manner and places of articulation. In Table 2.4 these are organized in a 5  5
matrix where the places of articulation are arranged from velar to labial. The
categories mentioned in this table are traditional subjective views. Of these the
second row presents the affricates the others are plosives/stops. The third row
presents the retroflex plosives.
The acoustics of all the consonants are presented below separately for individual
plosives, affricates, fricatives, lateral, trill, and taps. An additional section on
consonantal murmurs has been included though it is not a separate phoneme, yet it
exhibits characteristic acoustic signatures and requires special attention in speech
technology applications. These represents voiced occlusion portions of plosives and
affricates. The reason behind inclusion of the section is that one does not ﬁnd
in-depth study of acoustics of these portions in literature. It may not be out of order
here to mention that the deﬁnition of the so called unit ‘phoneme’ is not really a

crisp one. In fact, in real speech it is hard to locate them accurately. Let us consider
a simple vowel-plosive-vowel syllable (Fig. 2.3). We can locate the burst and the
voice onset time (VOT) as well as the occlusion period quite conﬁdently. But that is
not the whole plosive.
The plosive extends into the vowel, so called VC and CV segments, only then it
becomes cognitively meaningful. Again the whole voiced, the quasi-periodic region
namely from the beginning of CV to the end of the signal in the above ﬁgure, is not
the vowel alone. If one listens to only this whole quasi periodic signal segment one
will hear the CV syllable. For normal listener the difference on including the
preceding and the succeeding consonants is not even noticed. Again one has to
listen only to the complexity-wise steady part of the signal to hear the pure vowel.
Even then the boundaries of the steady part are also fuzzy, at least cognitively.
When one studies the acoustics of speech sound, one must give adequate

importance to the cognitive domain and be careful about segmentation so that
relatively conﬁdent zones are selected for parameter extraction.
In the following sections acoustics primarily related to the manners of produc-
tion will be discussed. It is because the other basis of categorization, namely the
place of articulation, does not normally put any distinctly robust imprint on the
spectral structure of the different elements of the consonantal segments. The con-
sonantal segments constitute occlusion of the vocal tract, burst, release and segment
of aspiration (see Fig. 2.4). Its effect is strongly marked on the quasi-periodic signal
representing the adjoining vowel with which the consonants interact strongly. In
fact the parameters like amount and direction of formant transition and the time of
transition (Datta et al. 1981; Datta and Ganguly 1981), are reported to be distinc-
tively related to the place of articulation. Figure 2.3 illustrates this with a particular
VCV syllable. It may be mentioned here that the transition of the second formant
provides the best cue (Datta and Mukherjee 2011) for this purpose as this formant
represents the backwardness of the tongue hump. One may notice from Fig. 2.4 that
the transition of F1 and F2 are different for different consonants. While F1 transition
is always downwards towards the burst, since at the point of release tongue always
touches the palate and F1 is related to the height, F2 movement can be both upwards
and downwards. The F2 transition varies normally according to the place of
articulation of the consonant. There is no F2 transition for [k] in [ɐkɐ] since it has
almost the same place of articulation as that of the vowel.
2.4.2 Acoustics of Plosives
Plosive sounds result from the blocking of the vocal tract by the tongue or lips,
allowing the air pressure to build upbehind the closure, and then by a sudden release of
it. This mechanism produces sounds like /p/, /k/ etc. The time for which the tract
remains blocked is called occlusion period. In Bangla for each place of articulation
there are ﬁve manners of production. Of these four manners related to voicing and

aspiration are produced by a unique process of co-ordination between the glottis and
the articulators namely the tongue or lips. Nasals are produced by connecting the
nasopharynx with the oral cavities by the opening of the velum. The aforesaid
co-ordination may be explained with reference to Figs. 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8. Each

ﬁgure has three sections. The uppermost and the lowermost sections show respec-
tively the signal and the corresponding spectrogram. The two bars in the middle
section are used to indicate the open (no colour) and the close (black colour) status of
the articulator and the glottis. Closed glottis produces the source voice and the closed

articulator suppresses energy in the higher frequencies. The mechanism for the pro-
duction of different manner of articulation is explained as follows:
(1) When both glottis and articulators are closed voice bars indicative of the voiced
manner of plosive are produced.
(2) If the articulator remains closed but the glottis is open it indicates a voiceless
occlusion.
(3) When both the articulator and the glottis remain open aspiration is produced
because of the turbulence created through the rushing of air through glottis.
(One may note that in this particular context the glottis may not be fully open.)
(4) If along with the condition (1) above the velum is open connecting the nasal
cavity, nasal murmurs are produced.
(5) Closed glottis with open articulator produces normal quasi-periodic sounds.
(6) If along with (5) velum remains open these give rise to the nasal set of vowels.
Voice Onset Time (VOT) is used in this article to deﬁne the time taken to close
glottis after the release of closure of the oral tract by the articulator. When the
length of VOT is large enough to make it acoustically perceptible, one hears them
as the aspirated counterpart of the phonemes even if there is not much aspiration
energy. Again if the VOT is small (say <20 ms), even if there is signiﬁcant aspi-
ration energy the aspiration is not heard.
2.4.3 Acoustics of Affricates
An affricate is a combination of plosive and fricative. In Bangla there are again four
types of affricates according to their manner of production, (1) unaspirated
unvoiced affricates /ʧ/, (2) aspirated unvoiced affricates /ʧʰ/, (3) unaspirated voiced
affricates /ʤ/ and (4) aspirated voiced affricates /ʤh
/. As we have seen in the case
of plosives in last section these manners also reflect unique co-ordination between
the opening and closing of the articulators with those of the glottis. However for
affricates the important thing to note is that unlike plosive the release is not
explosive in nature. The release is rather slow allowing the articulator to make a
constriction for some time before the full opening. During the period of constriction
air passing through it produces turbulence to cognitively reflect as noise. This
together with the occlusion has the cognitive sense of affricates. This part is indi-
cated by the grey in Figs. 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. On the other hand a fricative (as
will be discussed in a later section) does not have an occlusion period and the
frication is signiﬁcantly longer. In voiced affricate the occlusion is voiced whereas
in unvoiced affricates this part is silence. The spectral structures of the frictional
area may be seen from the corresponding fricatives discussed in the next section.

2.4.4 Acoustics of Fricatives
Fricative consonants are distinguished from other speech sounds by their manner of
production and the fact that they are noisy in character because of their predominant
randomness in the spectral structure. While the signal of the voiced speech is
quasi-periodic in nature all fricatives are quasi-random in Bangla. Bangla does not
have any voiced fricative. The Bangla fricatives are produced by the flow of air
through a narrow constriction produced in some region in the vocal tract. The major
articulators in Bangla which form the constriction are usually, the tongue blade and
the lips. This noise is then ﬁltered by the vocal tract, with the acoustic cavity in
front of the constriction contributing the greatest influence in ﬁltering. Figure 2.13
presents the mid-sagittal section of the vocal tract for different place of articulation
of the fricatives.
Fricatives are often divided into two groups: sibilants and non-sibilants. Sibilants
refer to a cognitive property, a hissing noise, which is the primary way to distin-
guish between alveolar fricatives and dentals. There may be two different mecha-
nisms for fricative sound generation: (1) an obstacle source, where the turbulence
may be generated at a rigid body approximately perpendicular to the airflow, or
(2) a wall source where sound is generated along a rigid wall parallel to the flow.
For /s, z/ and /š, ž/ the teeth are considered to be the obstacles while the upper lip is
an obstacle parallel to the flow for /f, v/, /z, ž, and v/ (Shaddle 1990). These are not
Bangla fricatives.
Fricative Spectra, according to the theory of speech production and simpliﬁed
electrical models (Heinz and Stevens 1961), can be characterized by poles and
zeroes, which depend on the location of the constriction which is also the source of
excitation. Also the resonance frequencies are inversely related to the size of the
front cavity. It appears that the back cavity would act as the shunt for the source of
noise and therefore their effect on the noise spectra would be revealed as
anti-resonances.
There are three fricatives [ʃ], [ş] and [s] in Bangla. The basic spectral character of
these unvoiced fricatives relate to pure random noise without harmonic structure.
The major characteristic spectral features are the resonances and anti resonances.
Another important feature is the spectral tilt. Figures 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 represent
Fig. 2.13 Midsagittal cross-section of a vocal tract constriction (Perkel 1969)

examples of the spectra of the three fricatives in Bangla. There is always a major
anti-resonance in the low frequency region of the spectra. This will be referred to as
the trough hereafter. In these ﬁgures it is indicated by a vertical wide arrow. Only
the major peaks after the trough are considered for further description and these are
indicated by single inclined arrows. Spectral tilt is considered for characterizing

only the high energy part of the spectrum starting with the ﬁrst peak point as shown
by the trend lines in the ﬁgures. The coefﬁcient of ‘x’ in the equation for trend line
is taken as the measure of a tilt.
The acoustic features need to be examined are: locations of (1) the trough, (2) the
ﬁrst three peaks, (3) the most prominent peak and (4) the slope of the spectral tilt. The
statistics of these acoustic parameters are presented in Table 2.5. Except the tilt all
values are in Hertz. For tilt the ﬁgures represent the slope. It may be seen from the table
that the frequencies of trough, the most prominent peak and the slope of the tilt clearly
distinguishes [ʃ] from the other two fricatives. However these parameters are not much
distinctive for [s] and [ş]. In fact this is vindicated by Fig. 2.17, which represents
pictorially the separability of these parameters for the three fricatives. The mean value
is indicated by the cross and the lines represent the spreads of the features. The spread
equals mean ± SD. In fact the frequencies of the presented peaks as well as the
spectral tilt each makes [ʃ] disjoint from both [s] and [ş].
Standard deviations of the frequency of the trough as well as those for peaks for
the three fricatives are quite small indicating good stability. There is a small
problem though; the peaks do not really represent the mean values of different
formant frequencies as they do in vowel spectra. Usually in the spectral data the
ﬁrst, the second or the third peak may appear at any frequency whatsoever.
One could approach to estimate the formants from the probability distribution of
the spectral peaks appearing in all the signals of a particular fricative. Figure 2.18
presents these distributions for the three fricatives. It may be seen from these

diagrams that for [ʃ] two formants at 2500 and 3500 Hz are quite prominent. For [s]
the ﬁrst formant is at 3000 Hz. Three other formants are at 4000, 5000 and
6500 Hz. Similarly for [ş] these are respectively at 1500, 3000, 4000 and 5000 Hz.
The bins used for calculating the distribution was of 500 Hz width. The aforesaid
values represent the mode values not the mean values. One may note that [ş] is
characterized by a peak appearing at a relatively low frequency of 1500 Hz.
2.4.5 Acoustics of Laterals
The lateral sounds are produced when the mid-coronal closure is complete and the
air escapes around one or both sides of the closure. Bangla has only one lateral
sound /l/. We shall see later that this could be both bi-lateral and unilateral. For
these sounds the air passage is fully blocked medially but at someplace below the
dental region an escape route exists some times on both sides (bi-lateral production)
and at other times only one side (unilateral production). Because of the fact that the
obstruction is at the dental region, the back cavity is large. This should have
reflection in the ﬁrst two formant frequencies. Furthermore the obstruction of the air
passage is likely to cause relatively larger reduction of energy in the higher bands
though a general loss of energy of the laterals compared to the adjoining vowels is
expected. Figure 2.19 represents the spectrgram of a /VLV/ syllable with white line
representing the F0. The lateral can be easily identiﬁed here.
Fig. 2.18 Probability distribution of peaks in spectral energy
Fig. 2.19 Spectrogram of a /VLV/ syllable
2.4 Methodologies 73
Figure 2.20 gives the spectral sections of the three sections. One could easily see
the reduction of the ﬁrst harmonics.
As mentioned earlier the medial obstruction is likely to create reduction of signal
energy. To see whether this happens, it is decided to examine the loss of energy in
the low frequency band as well as the high frequency band. For this F0 is deter-
mined ﬁrst and then this value is used as the cut off frequency for band pass ﬁlters
provided in Cool-Edit Pro (Fig. 2.21)
Figure 2.22 presents the loss of energy on lateralization separately for the low
frequency band (F0) and the high frequency region. There is loss in 96% of the
Fig. 2.20 Spectral sections of constituent phonemes

band
Fig. 2.22 Loss of energy in
dB on lateralization
74 2 Consonants
cases for the laterals in the high frequency band and 81% cases in the low frequency
band, the average loss being about 7 dB and 4 dB respectively. Thus there is in
general loss of energy in both the bands with that in the F0 being more prominent.
Figure 2.23 shows the distribution of laterals separately for F1 and F2. The mean
value of F1 of the laterals was found to be 421 Hz with the standard deviations of
142 Hz. The distribution of F2 being far from normal mean value may not be used
for representation. One may note that the distribution is bi-modal for the second
formant. These two modes are due to the influence of the front-back position of the
preceding vowel. The ﬁrst mode is located at about 1400 Hz and the second mode
at about 2300 Hz.
Figure 2.24 shows the position of [l] with reference to Bangla vowels in the
F1-F2 plane. It may be noticed that the position of the lateral is in the region on
inner side of the relatively free space unoccupied by the boomerang shaped vowel
distribution. It indicates the possibility of distinguishing the lateral using the ﬁrst
two formant frequencies in case of Bangla.

2.4.6 Acoustics of Trills and Taps
Trills may be described as phones generated by the vibration of some suprala-
ryngeal articulators (tongue-tip, uvula, lips). This vibration is caused by the aero-
dynamic forces, whereas taps and flaps involve active muscular movements of the
tongue. The setting up of the tongue-tip vibration involves muscle contraction,
shape and elasticity requirements of the tongue, and a sufﬁcient pressure difference
across the constriction. Once trilling is initiated, tongue-tip vibration is maintained
as a self-sustaining vibratory system. Pressure builds up behind the lingual con-
striction until it forces the tongue-tip to open. The air rushes out causing the
pressure to drop. The reduction of pressure along the constriction due to the
Bernoulli Effect makes the tongue-tip spring back to the contact position. This cycle
repeats (Catford 1977; Ladefoged 1967; Spajić et al. 1996; Mcgowan 1922). For
trills the tongue body is more constrained than for the tap. Trills coarticulate less
with neighbouring vowels. The acoustic waveform for voiced trills exhibits a low
amplitude murmur during the tongue-tip closure.
Tapisproducedwithasinglecontractionof themusclessothat onearticulator(usually
the tongue) is thrown against another articulator. The tongue body is less constrained than
in trill. The tap is articulated with a restricted short apico-alveolar closure and more
pre-dorsum lowering than other alveolars (Recasens and Pallare 1999).
It is said that Bangla has one trill [r] one unaspirated retroflex tap [ɽ] and one
aspirated retroflex tap [ɽh]. Figure 2.25 shows examples of spectrograms and wave
forms of two instances of [r]. The tap positions are indicated by the arrows. The left
one shows a single tap and the right ﬁgure shows two taps indicating a trill. The
thick horizontal lines above the wave forms indicate the duration of [r]. Similarly
Fig. 2.26 shows corresponding examples for [ɽ] and [ɽh].
Bangla [r] is traditionally reported to be a trill, which means there would be more
than one contact of the tongue with the palate. Similarly [ɽ] and [ɽh] is traditionally
reported to be taps indicating a single contact. However acoustic examination of a
large number of instances of multiple speakers from the aforesaid data base
revealed that only 10% of the instances for [r] exhibited a double contact the rests
Fig. 2.25 Examples of spectra and wave forms of [r]
76 2 Consonants
only one contact. This indicates that, with Bangla native speakers, [r] is generally a
tap. The same examination with [ɽ] revealed that all instances have a single contact
indicating it to be a tap. However 88% of [ɽh] exhibited double contacts indicating
that this may be a trill or a rolled utterance.
Since for all these sounds the oral cavity is divided by the tongue the position of
contact is likely to influence the formant frequencies, particularly the F2. As the data
base consists of these sounds in various different vowel contexts the co articulation
effect may be quite signiﬁcant. For locating F1 and F2 frequency distribution of the
formants has been drawn (Fig. 2.27).
Fig. 2.27 Frequency distribution of F1 and F2 for the taps and trills
Fig. 2.26 Examples of spectra and wave forms of [ɽ] and [ɽh]
2.4 Methodologies 77
The distributions for F1 are unimodal indicating absence of influence of
adjoining vowels. Which is expected, as in all cases the tongue touches the palate.
Modes observed from Fig. 2.27 for F1 are 600, 450 and 400 Hz respectively for [r],
[ɽ] and [ɽh]. The low value for [ɽ] and [ɽh] indicate possible lowering of the jaw
which may be necessary to accommodate curling of the tongue. The frequency
distributions for F2 exhibit multi modality with major modes at 1200 and 1600 Hz
for [r], 650 and 1050 Hz for [ɽ], and 700 and 1100 Hz for [ɽh]. The multi-modality
indicates contextual influences of adjoining vowels. So does large values of stan-
dard deviations.
Table 2.5 presents the mean and standard deviations for duration, F1 and F2 for
these three consonants. The SDs are generally low for F1 indicating almost no
influence of the adjoining vowels. However the comparatively larger values of
standard deviations for F2 are expected as the distributions are far from normal.
A reference to Fig. 2.27 reveals that the distribution of F2 is multimodal. In fact this
puts into question the effectiveness of mean and standard deviation to characterize
the variability of this particular parameter. The examination of the detail data
revealed strong influence of the vowels on F2. The standard deviations of durations
for all these consonants are fairly low. Along with that the mean values being quite
different, duration may considered as an inter class distinctive feature for these
consonants. Figure 2.28 shows the position of the taps and trills in F1-F2 plane in
relation to Bangla vowels represented by gray ovals. The vowel positions are taken
from an earlier report (Datta 1988).
Figure 2.29 presents frequency distribution of duration for these consonants.
Modes are seen to be well separated. It may be seen that the mode of duration for [r]
is around 45 ms, and is distinctively less than those for [ɽ and ɽh
]. The retroflexing
of the tongue is expected to need more time. The modes for the last two are at 105
and 120 ms respectively. The large value for ɽh is expected as this trill generally
contains two separate contacts.
It needs to be mentioned that there are only few words in Bangla which contains
[ɽh]. These are /driɽhɔ/, /muɽhɔ/ and /ɐʃɐɽh/, /gɐɽhɔ/, /guɽhɔ/, /mɐɽhi/, and /ruɽhɔ /
respectively meaning ‘ﬁrm’, ‘dumb’, ‘the name of a month’, ‘thick, ‘secret’ ‘gum’
and ‘rude’. It is very likely that in common speech [ɽh] may not, and even need not,
be pronounced in its proper manner for general communication purposes.

2.4.7 Consonantal Murmurs
Consonantal murmurs are deﬁned here as speech sounds produced by the occlusion
of the oral tract when the vocal chords are oscillating. These are not phonemes by
themselves but plays an important role in manner distinction and therefore demands
investigation. These may be purely oral, e.g. [g, gh
, d, dh
, ɖ, ɖh
, b, bh
, ʤ, and ʤh
] in
Bangla or purely nasal, e.g., [n, ɲ, ɳ, ŋ, m] in Bangla. These murmurs need not be
confused with that of murmured vowels, a typical feature in many Indo-Aryan
languages (Chap. 1, Sect. 1.5), wherein murmur is associated with a lax glottis
introducing aspiration energy into the voice source (Klatt and Klatt 1990;
Hillenbrand et al. 1994; Stevens 2000; Ladefoged and Antananzas-Barroso 1985).
Though these consonantal murmurs constitute a large portion of consonantal sounds
not much attention towards the acoustic structure of these sounds seems to be
evident. Major attentions appear to be given to the anticipatory influence of these
sounds on the duration of the previous nucleus vowel and to the cognitive aspects
of these influences. The objective here is to study only the segmental acoustics of
these murmurs.
The articulatory mechanism for the production of these sounds may be under-
stood from the schematic diagram presented in Fig. 2.30. The air stream from lungs
causes oscillation of the vocal folds in the closed glottis during the production of
the preceding vowel. The murmurs are produced by the occlusion of the vocal tract
while the glottis remains closed and therefore voicing source remain active. If
during this occlusion the velum also remains closed the oral murmurs are produced.
The sound that emerges is not direct but by radiation across the walls of the mouth
cavity. However, when the velum is open sound also leaks through the nasopharynx
with associated addition of nasal formants.
The closure is likely to cause primarily a severe reduction of the sound energy.
One would expect the loss to be primarily in the high frequency region as radiation
allows low frequency components to come out albeit with some absorption. As the
Fig. 2.29 Frequency
distribution of duration of
[r, ɽ and ɽh
]
2.4 Methodologies 79
closure takes place after the production of preceding vowel the air-stream velocity
across the glottis is likely to start fading out because the sink is closed. This may
result in the lowering of F0. Furthermore this closure may also cause a back
pressure disturbing the normal free functioning of the vocal folds, the signature of
which is likely to be found in the amplitudes of the ﬁrst two harmonics, H1 and H2,
relative to that of F0. With these premises in view the study is conducted with about
200 murmurs of which 89 are oral the rest are nasals. A comparative study of the
following parameters is done for the consonantal murmurs with respect to the
preceding vowels:
(A) Total energy
(B) Energy in the low frequency band
(C) Change in the F0
(D) Amplitude of H1and H2 with respect to that of F0
(E) The relative amplitudes of H1 and H2.
The VC segments have been manually extracted from the speech corpus of
CDAC, Kolkata. The simple afﬁrmative sentences spoken by ﬁve male and ﬁve
female native informants (see Table 1.1 of Chap. 1) has been used for the purpose.
The number of oral murmurs and that of nasal murmurs are 89, and 104 respec-
tively. Table 2.6 represents the number of samples for murmurs with different
places of articulation.
For the purpose of extracting parameters the signals corresponding to each
sentence need to be segmented. This was done manually through an examination of
both the signal proﬁle and the corresponding 3D spectrogram.
Figure 2.31 presents the spectrogram and corresponding waveform of a simple
afﬁrmative sentence, ‘ʃe nɐbiker nɐm kɔlombɐʃ’, meaning ‘that sailor’s name

(is) Columbus’. The segmentation of vowels and succeeding consonantal murmurs
are marked therein.
The following procedure is adopted generally for the extraction of the param-
eters. For this segments of signal of length 40 ms are selected on both sides bor-
dering the start of closure of the vocal tract. This closure generally leaves clear
identiﬁable visible signature in both the forms of representation (see Fig. 2.31).
However sometimes in both the forms the signature is not equally prominent. For
example in a vowel-murmur combination with the vowel [u] or [i] the amplitude
proﬁle may not provide a clear separability, in these cases 3D form is helpful.
Cool-edit Pro is used for the purpose. Figure 2.32 represents an example of the
spectrogram of a typical vowel murmur combination.
Figure 2.33 represents the corresponding spectrogram when the higher energy
above F0 is ﬁltered out using the ﬁlter package provided in Cool-Edit Pro. The
average loss of total energy due to the closure T
E for the same window of 40 ms is
measured using the following simple formulae:

The spectrum section presented in Fig. 2.34 may be used to describe the mea-
surements of the fundamental frequency F0 and the amplitudes of F0, and of the ﬁrst
two harmonics H1 and H2. The change in F0 due to the closure is measured in
semitone using the formula:
ΔF0 = 12 * log2 (v
F0/m
F0), where m
F0 and v
F0 presents respectively the fun-
damental frequency of the murmur and that of the preceding vowel.
The sudden closure of the air passage at the mouth cavity is likely to cause accu-
mulation of air coming from the lungs. This may develop a back pressure affecting the
vocal fold oscillations which in turn may cause variation in the amplitudes of H1 and
H2 with respect to that of F0. It is necessary to see if there is any such consistent effect.
For this, the amplitudes of F0, H1 and H2 are measured from the average spectrum
sections for 40 ms of the vowel signal just before the transition and that of the murmur
signal just after the transition. Three differences namely A
F0 − A
H1, A
F0 − A
H2 and
A
H1 − A
H2 were computed both for the vowel segment and the murmur segment,
where A
F0, A
H1, and A
H2 are amplitudes of F0, H1, and H2 respectively.
The occlusion of the vocal tract has been premised here to cause signiﬁcant loss
of energy in the output signal. Figure 2.35 presents the distribution of the pro-
portional losses (PL) of total energy and of low energy due to closure separately for

same pair after low pass ﬁlter

amplitudes of F0 and H1

the oral and nasal murmurs. The PL of total energy is seen for all oral murmurs and
96% for the nasal murmurs. Thus as expected, there is generally a loss of total
energy for the murmurs. As regards to the PL of energy in the low frequency band
just covering the F0 we see that while there is a loss for all oral murmurs a small but
signiﬁcant portion of about 15% of nasal murmurs do not show any such loss. This
may be due to the fact that sound leaks through the nasopharynx with associated
introduction of nasal resonances. The mode values are taken to indicate the amount
of PL instead of the average values simply because the distributions appear to be far
from normal. While with total energy the modal value of PL for oral murmurs is
0.8 dB that for nasal is 0.2 dB. The low value of PL for nasals may be again due to
the presence of a parallel path for the sound through the nasopharynx
It is interesting to note that the modal value of the loss in the energy of the
fundamental frequency due to closure is 0.8 dB for oral murmurs whereas there is
no loss for nasal murmurs. This is because for nasals there is a clear output path
through nasopharynx. It seems to indicate that of the total output of energy in the
case of oral murmurs the bulk of low energy is through radiation from the walls and
that the bulk of the energy directly out of the mouth opening consists of the high
frequency band. It must be remembered that the ﬁgures given above are propor-
tional loss; actual loss would be much larger as these would by multiplied by the
energy of the preceding vowel.
Figure 2.36 presents the change ΔF0 of fundamental frequency due to the closure
of the oropharynx. Again we take the largest mode value instead of average for the
reasons stated earlier. The largest mode value of 0 semitones indicates there is
generally no change in the F0 due to closure. However a closer perusal of Fig. 2.36
indicates that about 60% of oral murmurs and 67% of nasal murmurs do indicate a
decrease of F0. If we consider only samples which indicates a decrease then the
average value are 3.8 semitones for oral and 5.4 semitones for nasal murmurs.
This decrease is expected as the air stream velocity across the glottis is expected
to fall with the closure of the oropharynx. However under the same expectation on
the air stream velocity one would expect the leakage through nasopharynx would
work in opposition to the said effect of the closure. One should therefore expect
Fig. 2.35 Distribution of proportional loss of energy due to closure
2.4 Methodologies 83
lower value of the decrease for nasals instead of the observed signiﬁcantly higher
values. The main cause of the decrease may however be related to the functioning
of the laryngeal oscillators which needs direct observation of the vocal cord
movements when the oropharynx is closed and there is a consequent back-pressure
generated by accumulated air in the front cavity on the glottal structure.
Figure 2.37 shows the distribution of the decrease of the amplitude of H1 over
that of F0 for both the vowel segments and the murmur segments. In the case of oral
murmurs the modal value of decrease is 0 dB for the vowel and 30 dB for the
murmur. However about 48% of the vowels in these pairs showed some decrease
while 90% of the murmurs show a decrease of the amplitude. Again for the
vowel-nasal murmur pairs modal value of decrease is 5 dB for vowels and that for
the murmur is again 30 dB. Results seem to indicate clearly that murmurs cause
signiﬁcant decrease in the amplitude of H1 over that of the fundamental.
Figure 2.38 shows the distribution of the decrease of the amplitude of H2 over
that of F0 for both the vowel segments and the murmur segments. In the case of oral
Fig. 2.36 Distribution of ΔF0 due to closure of the oropharynx
Fig. 2.37 Distribution of samples with the amount of increase of F0 over H1
84 2 Consonants
murmurs the modal value of decrease is 0 dB for the vowel though an additional
mode of almost equal strength is observed at the modal value of 10 dB. That for the
murmur is at 30 dB same as that for H1. About 68% of the vowels in these pairs
showed some decrease while 98% of the murmurs show a decrease of the ampli-
tude. Again for the vowel-nasal murmur pairs modal value of decrease is 5 dB and
that for the murmur is again 30 dB. Results seem to indicate clearly that murmurs
cause signiﬁcant decrease in the amplitude of the second harmonic over that of F0.
Figure 2.39 presents the distribution of the increase of the amplitude of H1 over
that of H2 for both the vowel segment and the murmur segment. In the case of oral
murmurs the modal value of increase is 10 dB for the vowel. That for the murmur is
at 15 dB. About 71% of the vowels in these pairs showed some increase while 81%
of the murmurs show an increase of the amplitude. Again for the vowel-nasal
murmur pairs modal value of increase is 5 dB and that for the murmur is again
15 dB. About 71% of the vowels in these pairs showed some increase while 81% of
the murmurs show an increase of the amplitude.
An interesting observation from Figs. 2.37 and 2.38 is that nasal murmurs show
very distinctive prominent bi-modal distributions. This led to an investigation to see
Fig. 2.39 Distribution of samples with the amount of increase of H1 over H2
Fig. 2.38 Distribution of samples with the amount of increase of F0 over H2
2.4 Methodologies 85
if they have any relationship with the place of articulation or even with the pre-
ceding vowel class. Careful investigation revealed no such correspondences. In fact
this bimodality remained even for the two major murmur classes, m and n, as well
as for isolated vowel groups. The energy loss due to closure is signiﬁcant. The loss
is most for the higher frequencies, total for oral murmurs but insigniﬁcant for nasal
murmurs. The loss of energy for F band is negligible This indicates that in speech
the energy output in the very low frequency band is primarily through radiation.
The decrease of F0 frequency has been observed in a large number of cases.
A decrease in the average value is 3.8 semitones for oral and 5.4 semitones for nasal
murmurs which is unexpected because for nasal a separate path for airflow exists.
This put into doubt the conjecture that the decrease is due to the decrease in the
velocity of the airflow across vocal folds. The cause of decrease may be related to
the functioning of the glottal oscillations due to back pressure generated by the
accumulated air in the oral cavity. This gets strong support when we examine the
amplitudes of H1 and H2 with reference to that of the fundamental. The closure of
the vocal tract causes signiﬁcant decrease in the amplitude of the ﬁrst and second
harmonic with respect to that of F0. This indicates the possibility of the effect of
closure on the functioning of the vocal folds. One may note here that the closure
causes accumulation of air in the back cavity which may cause this.
2.4.8 Summary
While summarizing the aforesaid ﬁndings on acoustics of Bangla consonants, it
may be pertinent to observe that a comprehensive documentation of acoustics of
consonants in any of the Indo-Aryan spoken language is hard to ﬁnd. Also the
author could not ﬁnd data on acoustic properties of the murmurs associated with
voiced plosives and affricates in other language group also. At this moment,
therefore, it is not always possible to have an inter-lingual comparison. A crisp
summary would therefore be in order here. One important aspect of the plosives and
affricates in Bangla, in fact for most of the Indo-Aryan speech sounds, is that they
have full repertoire of manner classes. The relation of the acoustics of these
manners namely the voicing, the aspiration and the nasalization with the unique
process of co-ordination between the glottis, the articulators namely the tongue or
lips and the velum are described in detail. It is known that a fully closed glottis
produces source voice, while an open glottis, in the present context, produces
aspiration and an open velum produces nasality. Different interaction between these
three produces the ﬁve manners namely, unvoiced-unaspirated, unvoiced-aspirated,
voiced-unaspirated, voiced-aspirated and nasal.
For fricatives spectral features are examined with reference to (a) locations of the
trough, corresponding to the antiresonance of the cavities prior to the source,
(b) ﬁrst three peaks and the most prominent peak corresponding to the resonances
of the cavities, post to the source and (c) to the slope of spectral tilt. The frequencies
of the presented peaks as well as the spectral tilt shows [ʃ] to be distinct from both
86 2 Consonants
[s] and [ş]. On the other hand [ş] is characterized by a peak appearing at a relatively
low frequency of 1500 Hz.
Acoustics of the only lateral /l/ is influenced by the medial blockage and lateral
escape for the air-stream. There is, in general, compared to the preceding vowel a
loss of energy in both the F0 band and the high energy band with that in the F0 band
being more prominent. The mean value of F1 and F2 of the laterals were found to be
421 and 1502 Hz respectively. The respective standard deviations are 142 and
365 Hz. The position of this lateral in the vowel diagram is quite distinct and is in
the inner space of the ‘boomerang’ shaped distribution of Bangla vowels. One may
note that the distribution is bi-modal for the second formant. These two modes are
due to the influence of the front-back position of the preceding vowel.
The acoustic investigations reveal Bangla native speakers [r] is generally a
tap. This is in contradiction to the traditional description of [r] as a trill. The same
examination with [ɽ] revealed that all instances have a single contact indicating it to
be a tap instead of its traditional categorization as a trill. We shall see corroboration
of these ﬁnding later with EPG analysis. However 88% of [ɽh] exhibited double
contacts indicating that this may be a trill or a rolled utterance. The determination of
the ﬁrst two formants helps in ﬁxing their position in the vowel diagram. It is found
that while [r] has a distinct position, [ɽ, ɽh] are not separable and their positions are
congruent with that of vowel [o].
Consonantal murmurs, a new class introduced for studying their acoustics, are
deﬁned here as speech sounds produced by the occlusion of the oral tract when the
vocal chords are oscillating. As expected, there is generally a loss of about 80% in
total energy and only 30% in the F0 band. This indicates the most of the output
energy in the F0 band is indirect by radiation through the walls of mouth cavity. For
nasal murmurs there is, in general, no loss in F0 band and only about 30% loss in
the total energy. This is also expected as there is an additional pathway for the
sound through the nasopharynx. As regards to the effect on F0 it is found that about
60% of oral murmurs and 67% of nasal murmurs do indicate a decrease of F0. The
examination of amplitudes of fundamental and the ﬁrst two harmonics reveal that
the amplitudes of the ﬁrst two harmonics decrease signiﬁcantly in comparison with
those for the preceding vowels.
2.5 EPG Analysis
While acoustics can provide very distinctive description of manners of consonantal
categories, it does not provide useful distinctive robust characteristics for the cat-
egories related to place of articulation. Apart from subjective categorization, which
has been most prevalent traditionally, there are various objective methods of
determining the place of articulation. These include cine-fluorography,
ultra-sonography, videography, endoscopy and palatography. The
cine-fluorography being medically hazardous it is not used now a day.
Ultra-sonography has not yet reached the necessary technological level to provide
2.4 Methodologies 87
the needed robustness while endoscopy is very uncomfortable and restricts severely
the freedom of the speaker. Thus video capture and palatography remains the main
tools in use. The latest development in palatography is the EPG system.
While general principle of using EPG has been briefly described in Sect. 1.2 it is
necessary to give some details of experiment conducted for the present study. One
issue is the selection of appropriate frame for a particular category of consonant.
The other is the methodology used for obtaining a representative frame from a set of
frames coming from the repetitions of the same syllable/word. This exercise is
necessary for standardization so that the data from different languages are
comparable.
Locating the frame or frames for investigating an event must also be well
deﬁned. This is necessary as the ﬁnal data would be a representative of a number of
repetitions, and the sequences of each representation should conform to the con-
stituent events in best possible way. An occlusion is easily identiﬁed when the
frames have the sequence of continuous black cells connect the two sides of the
palate showing a complete separation of the front and back halves of the palate
(Fig. 1.1 in Sect. 1.2). A closure is indicated when such a frame is preceded by a
frame with a discontinuity. A break in this continuity is characteristic of the
beginning of a release. The frame characterizing such a break must be seen in the
continuity of frames to know whether it is a release or a closure. Contact area is
measured by the number of contacts made to the total number of electrodes in the
whole EPG frame and is expressed as percentage.
The place of articulation of the friction is determined by the EPG frame where
the opening is narrowest. Figure 2.40 shows an example illustrating the procedure
for fricatives. Double headed arrow indicates the segment corresponding to the

acoustic event friction. Slightly grayed area represents the frames corresponding to
narrowest constriction. The grayer frame at the middle of the friction zone is the
selected frame.
Figure 2.41 shows a sequence of EPG frames containing a lateral. The complete
medial closure is clear with a large unilateral opening at the right side for this
particular instance can also be clearly seen.
For each event like release, closure, constriction etc., related to a phoneme, there
are EPG frames the number of which depends on the group being considered, e.g.
for individual speaker and a speciﬁc context this number is minimum of 10 repe-
titions. One has to decide on a procedure for getting a frame which shall represent
the set of these frames. The issue of registration of the sequence has already been
discussed. As indicated in Sect. 1.3 an EPG frame presents an array of small
rectangles either black or white. A binary matrix is ﬁrst obtained by putting ‘1’ for
black cell indicating a contact and ‘0’ for white indicating no contact. There are 10
such frames for each event in a sequence, a particular CV or VC context, for each
informant. The representative frame is constructed in the following manner. The
value of each cell is computed by adding the number of 1’s for all these 10
repetitions. Then cumulated values are divided by the number of frames obtained
for the speaker for that context. The computed value is used to determine the gray
value of the cell where a purely black one indicates that all frames show a contact
has been made at that cell. A purely white cell indicates that no contact has been
made there. Thus the original binary picture of the frame is converted into a
representative gray level picture to accommodate variations in pronunciation.

2.5.1 Plosive/Stop
Figure 2.42 presents one series of EPG frames for VCV utterance where C is an
unvoiced unaspirated plosive to exemplify selection of frames to study the place of
articulation as plosive and stop for these consonants. The lighter gray shaded frames
represents the occlusion period. The deeper gray frames are the terminal ones to be
used for determining the place of articulation of plosives and stops.
ক [k]
Figures 2.43 and 2.44 presents the representative EPG frames averaged over the
selected frames from ten repetitions, of the release for [k] for each of the seven
Bangla vowels respectively for female and male speakers. A general feature that is
observed in all such frames is that the contacts begins at the side much earlier going
maximally forward to the mid-sagittal position which represents the place of
articulation. This indicates a funnel shaped tongue conﬁguration. It can be seen
from these that a complete closure is not observed for many vowels due to an
inherent restriction of the artiﬁcial palate. As mentioned earlier the artiﬁcial palate is
Fig. 2.42 Selection of closure and release frames for plosives
Fig. 2.43 Place of release of [k] for seven Bangla vowels for the female speaker

made only up to the beginning of the soft palate. This problem will be seen for all
manners for this place of articulation. However in the case of front vowels the
complete closure is observed. Apparently the tongue hump is pulled forward for
front vowels. Also there is a noticeable difference between the male and female
informants, the tongue hump seem to be a little bit forwarded for the female
speaker.
Figure 2.45 represents the overall place of release for the consonant /k/ with all
the frames pooled together. Considering the limitation of the artiﬁcial palate
mentioned above the ﬁgure indicates that the place of release may be taken as the
traditional position of velar.
The area of contact of consonant /k/ varies with respect to different vowels.
Average duration and energy in the occlusion is found to be 55.76 ms and
−42.99 dB respectively. The spectral and signal domain evidences do not show
voicing. This together with very low VOT (8.51 ms) makes this plosive unvoiced
and unaspirated velar.
Figures 2.46 and 2.47 present EPG frames constructed in the manner described
in an earlier paragraph depicting the place of closure of stop [k] for seven Bangla
vowels respectively for the female and the male speakers. Here also is a noticeable

difference between the male and female informants, the tongue hump seem to be a
little bit forwarded for the female speaker.
Figure 2.48 indicates that the overall place of closure for the stop [k]. Thus [k] is
velar both as stop and plosive.
Henceforth the detail EPG frames for individual ﬁles shall not be shown in these
sections. Only the overall frames computed from all frames separately for the male
and female speakers will be presented in these sections. However for the interest of
the inquisitive readers these will be provided with appropriate concise comments in
the Appendix.
Plosive/Stop খ [kh
]:
Same difference as was seen for [k] between the male and female informants is
present for [kh
] also. Figures 2.49 and 2.50 represent the overall places of articu-
lation respectively for release and closure for the plosive [kh
]. Both being almost
identical [kh
] is velar both as stop and plosive.
There is not much of a difference in closure conﬁguration between [k] and [kh
]
except for a feeble indication that tongue may be a wee bit retracted for the aspi-
rated counterpart.
The area of contact of consonant [kh
] varies with respect to different vowels.
Average occlusion duration is found to be 50.23 ms and average occlusion period

energy is −43.16 dB. The length of the VOT is 46.63 ms which is much larger than
8.51 ms of the unaspirated counterpart [k]. This makes this sound cognitively
aspirated. There is no acoustic evidence of voicing during the occlusion. Thus both
as a plosive and a stop Bangla [kh
] is unvoiced and aspirated.
Plosive/Stop গ [g]
Same difference as was seen for [k] between the male and female informants is
present for [g] also. Figures 2.51 and 2.52 represent the overall places of articu-
lation respectively for release and closure for the plosive [g]. Both being almost
identical [g] is velar both as stop and plosive.
Average occlusion duration is found to be 44.42 ms and average occlusion
period energy is −31.52 dB. In case of unvoiced counterpart the average energy
was −42.99 dB. Thus occlusion region show signiﬁcant acoustic energy. Also from
the acoustic evidence it can be stated that during the occlusion period the glottal
vibration do exist. There is also a negligible VOT of 4.47 ms after the burst along
with the voiced signal. This duration is non-cognitive as far as aspiration is

concerned. All these taken together shows that Bangla consonant [g] is voiced
unaspirated velar.
Plosive/Stop ঘ [gh
]
Same difference as was seen for [k] between the male and female informants is
present for [gh
] also. Figures 2.53 and 2.54 represent the overall places of articu-
lation respectively for release and closure for the plosive [gh
]. Both being almost
identical [gh
] is velar both as stop and plosive.
Average occlusion duration is 44.99 ms and average occlusion period energy is
−33.01 dB. In case of unvoiced counterpart the average energy was −43.16 dB,
which is much smaller. The acoustic evidence shows that during the occlusion period
the glottal vibrations do exist. VOT after the burst being long (about 45.89 ms)
aspiration is cognizable. Thus Bangla plosive [gh
] is voiced and aspirated.
In general for all manners the average EPG frames for velars, even when
examined for each vowel, is almost the same (detail vowel-wise and sex-wise EPG
frames are given in Appendix). The effect of the preceding vowels in the closure
pattern is generally same, i.e. closure area is pulled forward slightly for front
vowels. Similarly for all manners of production the place of articulation is slightly
forwarded for the female speaker.
Plosive/Stop ট [ʈ] and ঠ [ʈh
]
Figures 2.55 and 2.57 represents the overall place of release for the consonant [ʈ]
and [ʈh
] respectively. While the main concentration is in the Post alveolar region
signiﬁcant extension is observed up to the root of the teeth.
Figures 2.56 and 2.58 represents the overall place of closure for the consonant
[ʈ] and [ʈh
] respectively. A comparison of the above two sets of ﬁgures reveals
noticeable difference. The place of closure for this consonant may still be

]

considered as post-alveolar but distinctly palatalized. Thus for these plosives the
tongue distinctly roles forward for release. Moreover one can notice that more area
comes under contact in the case of release.
From the detailed vowel-wise EPGs (see Appendix) it is observed that the place
of closure is post alveolar in case of front vowel of both speaker but it is palatal in
case of back vowel for both the speaker.
Average occlusion duration for [ʈ]is 59.77 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −41.91 dB. No acoustic evidence of voicing during occlusion is found
also the length of the VOT (3.06 ms) being insigniﬁcant the manner of this plosive
is unvoiced unaspirated.
Average occlusion duration for [ʈh
] is 58.26 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −43.22 dB. The signiﬁcant length 44.05 ms of the VOT and absence of

the acoustic evidence of glottal vibration during the occlusion makes Bangla
consonant [ʈh
] as unvoiced aspirated post-alveolar as a plosive as well as a stop.
Plosive/Stop ড [ɖ] ঢ
Figures 2.59 and 2.61 represent the overall place of release for the consonant [ɖ]
and [ɖh
]. From this ﬁgure the place of these plosives is seen primarily to be post
alveolar however one notices like in the case of its unvoiced counterpart some
extension up to the root of teeth.
A perusal of Figs. 2.60 and 2.62 shows that the place of closure is palatal. From
the detailed vowel-wise EPGs (see Appendix) it is observed that the place of
closure is post alveolar in case of front vowel of both speakers but it is palatal in
case of back vowel for both of them.

96 2 Consonants
Average occlusion duration for [ɖ] is 59.57 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −30.99 dB. From the acoustic evidence it can be stated that during the
occlusion period the glottal vibration do exist. The average length of the VOT being
3.31 ms the plosive is unaspirated. So it can be concluded that the Bangla con-
sonant [ɖ] is voiced unaspirated retroflex post-alveolar plosive.
Average occlusion duration of [ɖh
] is 54.33 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −28.67 dB. In case of unvoiced counterpart the average energy is
−43.22 dB, which is much smaller. From the acoustic evidence it can be stated that
during the occlusion period the glottal vibration do exist. There is also an aspiration
of 48.7 ms after the burst along with the voiced signal. The manner of articulation is
known to be retroflex. So it can be concluded that the Bangla consonant [ɖh
] is
voiced aspirated retroflex post-alveolar plosive/stop.
It is obvious that EPG cannot provide direct evidence of retroflexion. Therefore
one has to depend on the subjective judgment of the speaker or an appropriate
video-graphic arrangement for this. However if one carefully peruses and compares
the overall EPG frames of all the plosive/stop consonant of Bangla one may notice
signiﬁcantly large increase in the area of contact for the retroflex ones, irrespective
of the manners of production. This may be due probably to the fact that retroflection
induces a larger and ﬁrmer contact with the palate. This then can be taken as the
signature for retroflexion in EPG. The other signature appears to be that the release
place is distinctly forwarded from that of closure indicating a forward movement of
the tongue.
Plosive/Stop ত,থ,দ,ধ [t, th

Figures 2.63, 2.64, 2.65, 2.66, 2.67, 2.68, 2.69 and 2.70 represent the overall place
of release and closures for the consonant [t, th
, d, dh
].
It may be observed from the above ﬁgures that the places of release of these
plosives are at the region of root of teeth. Since the ﬁrst sensor row of the artiﬁcial

palate are only in the root of teeth region (there being no contact for teeth) and
contact is always present in this region for all of the vowels this may possibly be
considered as dental as it is traditionally believed.
From the above ﬁgures it is observed that the place of closure is somewhat
retracted but still may be called dental.
Average occlusion duration is 64.93 ms and average occlusion period energy is
−43.76 dB. There is no evidence of voicing. The length of the VOT is 3.94 ms
which is negligible. Thus the Bangla consonant [t] is unvoiced unaspirated dental
plosive/stop.
Average occlusion duration for [th
] is 49.32 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −42.56 dB. There is no acoustic evidence of voicing. The length of the
VOT is 28.02 ms which makes aspiration cognizable. Thus the Bangla consonant
[th
] is unvoiced aspirated dental plosive.
Average occlusion duration for [d] is 48.86 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −31.06 dB. From the acoustic evidence it can be stated that during the
occlusion period the glottal vibration do exist. There is also an aspiration after the
burst along with the voiced signal. The average length of the aspiration part is
3.03 ms and is insigniﬁcant. Thus the Bangla consonant [d] is voiced unaspirated
dental plosive/stop.
Average occlusion duration for [dh
] is 42.05 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −30.64 dB. From the acoustic evidence it can be stated that during the
occlusion period the glottal vibration do exist. There is also 48.35 ms of VOT after
the burst along with the voiced signal which makes aspiration cognizable. Thus the
Bangla consonant [dh
] is voiced aspirated dental plosive.
The limitation in artiﬁcial palate to record properly the closure in the velar region
has already been mentioned. One may also note here that because the artiﬁcial
palate does not cover the teeth and only ends at the root of the teeth one is not sure
whether some plosive/stops are purely dental.
The vowel-wise EPGs (presented in the Appendix) reveal that both the place of
release and closure for both male and female speakers for front vowels the place of
contact is forwarded. Though this is not large enough to merit particular attention in
general, it is found to be signiﬁcant in the following situation for retroflex
plosives/stops:
(a) [ƫ, ƫh, and ɖ] are dental with male speaker for release in front vowels
(b) [ƫ, and ƫh] are palatal/mediopalatal with both speakers in closure of back vowels

2.5 EPG Analysis 99
(c) [ɖh] is palatal/mediopalatal with male speaker in closure of back vowels
Plosive/Stop প, ফ, ব, ভ [p, ph
, b, bh
]
Traditionally [p, ph
, b and bh
] are known as bilabials and as expected the EPG did
not show any closure in the entire artiﬁcial palate region. The video of lips
movements of the informant is recorded during the production of this sound and
from the video evidence both the release and closure are found in the lips region.
Figures 2.71, 2.72, 2.73 and 2.74 represent the lips release frame for these plosives.
These indicate that these plosives are bilabial.
The varied degree of rounding of the lips corresponding to the vowels may be
observed from the squeezing of the lips in the pictures.

Average occlusion duration for [p] is 70.49 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −43.32 dB. No acoustic evidence of voicing was found. The length of the
VOT, 3.58 ms, is insigniﬁcant. Thus Bangla [p] is unvoiced unaspirated bilabial.
Average occlusion duration for [ph
] is 47.41 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −41.23 dB. The length of the VOT is 32.11 ms which indicates cognitive
level of aspiration. There is no acoustic evidence of glottal vibration during the
occlusion period indicating this Bangla consonant to be unvoiced aspirated bilabial
plosive.
Average occlusion duration for [b] is 51.72 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −30.64 dB. There is also an aspiration after the burst along with the
voiced signal. However the VOT of 2.76 ms is insigniﬁcant. Along with these,
glottal vibration during the occlusion period indicate that the Bangla consonant [b]
is voiced unaspirated bilabial.
Average occlusion duration for [bh
] is 49.59 ms and average occlusion period
energy is −29.94 dB. The average length of the VOT is 52.51 ms is signiﬁcant.
Along with this glottal vibration during the occlusion period indicate that the
Bangla consonant [bh
] is voiced aspirated bilabial.
Table 2.7 gives the summary of parameter values for the occlusion period and
VOT for all plosives. The occlusion time is 14% less for voiced counterpart for all
articulatory positions. This difference is known to be cognizably signiﬁcant. The
acoustic energy during occlusion is signiﬁcantly less (12 dB approximately) for
unvoiced counterpart. VOT is negligible for unaspirated counterpart and cognizably
signiﬁcant (except for [th
] and [ph
]. These ﬁgures show that manner based classi-
ﬁcation of Bangla plosives are phonetically signiﬁcant.

2.5.2 Fricative
The place of articulation of the friction can be determined from the EPG frame
where the opening is narrowest (see Fig. 2.41). The method of selection of
appropriate frame is described earlier in Sect. 1.5.
Fricative শ [ʃ]
Figure 2.75 presents the overall place of constriction for the fricative [ʃ].
It may be seen from the above ﬁgure that the overall place of constriction for the
consonant [ʃ] is post-alveolar. There being no acoustic evidence of voicing it may
be said that /ʃ/ is Unvoiced Post alveolar Fricative
There has been no noticeable overall signiﬁcant difference between male and
female informants. However it has been noticed that in case of male speaker the
place of constriction is slightly palatalized for back vowels.
Fricative স [s]
Figure 2.76 presents the overall place of constriction for the fricative [s].
The place of constriction of the consonant [s] is primarily alveolar though
extends up forward a little. There being no acoustic evidence of voicing this con-
sonant is unvoiced alveolar fricative. For the informants used the constriction
appears to be on the right side of the mouth.
Examination of detail EPGs reveal that in case of front vowel the constriction
area is little bit forwarded. In the case of male speaker the constriction area spread
up to the root of the teeth region.
Fricative ষ [ş]
Figure 2.77 represents the overall place of friction for the consonant [ş] which is
palatal. The retroflexion is not revealed in EPG; however this fricative is tradi-
tionally believed to be retroflexed.
Here being no acoustical evidence of voicing [ş] may be regarded as unvoiced
retroflexed palatal fricative.

102 2 Consonants
There is a consistence EPG evidence of the place of articulation of all fricatives
in conjunction with front vowels, particularly for the male speaker, to be forwarded.
Fricative হ [h]
Figure 2.78 represents over all EPG frame contact position for all seven aspirated
vowels due to the constriction in association with the phone [h].
From the above ﬁgures it may be observed that there is an indication of constriction
appearing at the lower end of artiﬁcial palate. This strongly suggests a constriction
below the velar region. The traditional literatures also present [h] as a glottal fricative.
However a recent study of this sound in Bangla (Datta 2014) revealed that in this
dialect [h] does not reveal itself as a fricative but causes the succeeding vowel
murmured (see Sect. 1.5 of Chap. 1). In fact due to its influence a set of seven
murmured vowels has been reported for Bangla.
2.5.3 Affricates
In the case of affricates the place of release of the occlusion is determined from the
EPG frame just before the opening of the closure. The place of articulation of the
friction is determined by the EPG frame where the opening is narrowest. Manner of
articulation of the affricates is determined from the acoustic study of the
above-mentioned segments. The average occlusion duration and VOT duration
along with the average energy at occlusion period is presented.
Affricate চ[ʧ]
An affricate is a complex sound in the sense that it contains two consecutive
articulatory events namely plosion and friction, physically a sharp short release

2.5 EPG Analysis 103
followed by a constriction before fully opening for the vowel. During the whole
period the tongue may roll. Thus there may be two different places where tongue is
engaged with the palate. This calls for citing both of them as places of articulation.
However when this consonant is considered as the stop one may take the place of
closure as the place of articulation. Similarly, when this is at the beginning of the
vowel the place of constriction may be taken as the place of articulation. This
convention is followed here.
Figures 2.79 and 2.80 represents the place of release of [ʧ] for seven Bangla
vowels spoken respectively by the female and male speakers. Though there is no
mentionable difference in the place of articulation the male speaker show greater
amount tongue-palate contact.
Figure 2.81 represents the overall place of release.
From the above ﬁgures it is observed that the place of release is alveolar for the
back vowel in both male and female speaker. In the case of front vowels the tongue
tip is little bit forwarded during the release.
Figures 2.82 and 2.83 represents the place of constriction, for generating fric-
tion, in [ʧ] for seven Bangla vowels spoken respectively by the female and male
speakers.
Figure 2.84 represents the overall place of constriction.

104 2 Consonants
Though there is no mentionable sex-wise difference in the place of articulation
the male speaker show greater amount tongue-palate contact. The place of con-
striction is post alveolar.
Thus for this affricate occlusion occurs at alveolar position and constriction
occurs at post alveolar position.
Average occlusion duration is 41.98 ms and average occlusion period energy is
−42.51 dB. The length of the VOT (3.66 ms) is insigniﬁcant. Also there is no
acoustic evidence of voicing. So it can be concluded that the Bangla consonant [ʧ]
is unvoiced unaspirated affricate where the place of occlusion is alveolar and place
of friction is post-alveolar.
Affricate ছ [ʧh
]
Figures 2.85 and 2.86 represents the overall place respectively of release and of the
friction for the fricative [ʧh
]. The place of release is seen as alveolar and that of
friction is post-alveolar.
Figure 2.86 represents the overall place of friction of the fricative [ʧh
], which is
post-alveolar.
Average occlusion duration is 35.85 ms and average occlusion period energy is
−42.94 dB. The length of the VOT is 27.23 ms large enough to be cognitively
signiﬁcant. There being no evidence of the glottal vibration it can be concluded that

2.5 EPG Analysis 105
this Bangla consonant [ʧh
] is unvoiced aspirated affricate where the place of
occlusion is alveolar and place of friction is post-alveolar.
Affricate জ [ʤ]
Figures 2.87 and 2.88 represent the overall places respectively of release and
constriction for the fricative [ʤ]. The place of release and friction is seen to be
respectively at alveolar and post-alveolar region.
Average occlusion duration is 41.63 ms and average occlusion period energy is
−30.07 dB. The average length of VOT (5.08 ms) is insigniﬁcant. This with the
glottal vibration during the occlusion period indicates that the Bangla consonant
[ʤ] is voiced unaspirated affricate where the place of articulation of occlusion is
alveolar and place of articulation of friction is post-alveolar.

Affricate ঝ [ʤh
]
Figures 2.89 and 2.90 represents the overall place of release of [ʤh
] and place of
friction respectively
As the place of release and place of friction together represents the place of
articulation then the place of articulation of release is alveolar and place of articulation
of friction is post alveolar. Average occlusion duration is 34.04 ms and average
occlusion period energy is −32.51 dB. From the acoustic evidence it can be stated that
during the occlusion period the glottal vibration do exist. There is also an aspiration
after the burst along with the voiced signal. The average length of the aspiration part is
26.02 ms. Thus the Bangla consonant [ʤh
] is voiced aspirated affricate where the
place of articulation of occlusion is alveolar and place of articulation of friction is
post-alveolar. From detail vowel-wise EPGs for Bangla affricates it is noticed that the
tongue tip is little bit forwarded during the release for front vowels.
Thus Bangla affricates, irrespective of their manner of production are alveolar as
stop and post alveolar as release. This indicates that during the production of these
sounds the tongue is retracted by one place of articulation.
2.5.4 Laterals
The place of articulation of the lateral is determined by the EPG frame collected
from the middle of the production of the consonant.
Lateral ল [l]
Figures 2.91 and 2.92 represent the EPG frames collected at middle of the pro-
duction of the consonant [l] with all the seven vowels spoken by the female and
male speakers respectively. Let us peruse the EPG frame corresponding to the
Fig. 2.89 Overall place of
release of [ʤh
]
Fig. 2.90 Overall place of
constriction of [ʤh
]
2.5 EPG Analysis 107
vowel /a/, one may note here that it is the gray level representation of the ten
repetitions. There is a clear lateral path on the right flank for all utterances as
indicated by the three white cells on the right. At the same times there are two gray
cells on the left flank which indicates that for some utterance this pronunciation is
bilateral. Thus from minute examination of the average frames one can gather the
nature and the side of lateralization for the laterals.
Figure 2.93 represents overall articulatory contact positions for the
consonant [l].
From the above ﬁgures it is observed that during the production of consonant [l]
the articulator completely closes the air passage medially at front and air passes
thorough the side of the tongue. If the air passes through the one side of the tongue
then it is called unilateral and if the air passes through the both side then it is called
bi-lateral. From the above ﬁgures one could say that the Bangla consonant [l] is
predominantly unilateral with the caution that only two informants have been
examined. The place of articulation is dental. The average duration of the [l] in
Bangla is 54.02 ms.

2.5.5 Nasal Murmur
The place of articulation of the murmur is determined by the EPG frame collected
from the middle of the production of the consonant.
Consonant ঙ [ŋ]
Figure 2.94 represents overall articulatory closure positions for the consonant /ŋ/.
From the detailed vowel wise ﬁgure given in the Appendix it is seen that a
complete closure is observed in case of front vowels. Due to the limitation of
artiﬁcial palate sensor position as mention in Sect. 2.5.1 the complete closure is not
observe in case of rest of the vowels. From Fig. 2.99 the place of closure is in the
velar region. Therefore the place of articulation of [ŋ] is velar. The average duration
of the [ŋ] in Bangla is 50.68 ms
Consonant ঞ [ɲ]
The occurrence of this consonant is rare. Only two Bangla words has
been used for the study of this consonant. The 5 repetitions of those words are
recorded and the EPG frame collected from the middle of the production of the
consonant is considered for the place of articulation determination.
Figure 2.95 represents the overall place of closure for the above consonant.
From the ﬁgure it is observed that the place of articulation of the above con-
sonant is alveolar.
Consonant ণ [ɳ]
In general the [ɳ] is not pronounced in isolation in Bangla. It is only pronounced in
cluster with retroflex oral sounds. Due to the above reason this consonant is
recorded within a word where it is pronounced instead of usual VCV combination.

2.5 EPG Analysis 109
EPG frames collected from the middle of the production of the consonant are
considered for the determination of the place of articulation.
Figure 2.96 represents the overall EPG closure position for the above consonant.
From the above ﬁgure it is observed that the above consonant place of articu-
lation is palatal. Its manner of production is retroflex nasal. The average contact
area is 32.57%. The average duration of the [ɳ] in Bangla is 44.12 ms.
Consonant ন [n]
Figure 2.97 represents overall articulatory closure positions for the consonant [n].
The above ﬁgure shows that the place of contact this consonant is at the root of
the teeth. Taking note of the deﬁciency of the palate in not having contacts on the
teeth area, one may consider that the place of articulation of the above consonant as
dental. The average duration of the [n] in Bangla is 54.65 ms.
Consonant ম [m]
After analyzing the EPG frame data it is observed that there is no closure in the
whole palate region. The video of lips movement of the informant is recorded
during the production of this sound and from the video evidence the closure is
found in the lips region. Figure 2.98 represents the lips closure of during the
production of the above sound for all the Bangla vowels. The ﬁgures show that the
consonant [m] is bilabial. The average duration of the /m/ in Bangla is 57.06 ms

110 2 Consonants
In this experimental setup nasal spirometers to measure air passing out of nose
was not available. Therefore the nasality of this group of consonants was deter-
mined from the acoustic evidence and subjective listening.
2.5.6 Trills, Flap or Tap
Consonant র [r]
Figure 2.99 represents overall articulatory positions for the consonant [r].
The detail vowel wise frames show that there is no complete closure region. This
may be due to the situation that [r] being found mostly a tap (see Sect. 2.5.6) the
momentary contact of the tongue tip may occasionally miss capture in the EPG
system. Therefore the continuous black line indicating complete closure is not
always visible. However the gray level connectivity reflects the occasional capture
of the blockage. Overall place of closure can be considered at alveolar region. So
the places of articulation of the Bangla trill [r] is alveolar.
From an examination of the detailed vowel-wise EPG it is observed that the
place of contact of the tip of the tongue is more forwarded in case of front vowel for
both the speaker.
Consonant ড় ([ɽ])
The place of articulation of these sounds is determined by the EPG frame collected
from the middle of the production of the contact area. Contact area is measured by
the number of contacts made to the total number of electrodes in the whole EPG
frame and is expressed as percentage.
Figure 2.100 represents overall articulatory positions for the consonant [ɽ].
Fig. 2.100 Overall

Fig. 2.99 Overall
articulatory positions
2.5 EPG Analysis 111
The closure is in the region of post alveolar. The above consonant is retroflex
flap and the place of articulation is Post alveolar.
Consonant ঢ় ([ɽh])
The consonant [ɽh] is the aspirated counterpart of the consonant [ɽ], the place of
articulation remaining the same as for [ɽ]. But the only difference is that after the
release there is a perceptible amount of aspiration. Figure 2.101 represents the
overall EPG data for the contact position for [ɽ]. Thus [ɽh] is post alveolar aspirated
retroflex tap.
The EPG analysis conﬁrms the traditionally known places of articulation for [r, ɽ
and ɽh]. However both EPG and acoustic analysis revealed the possibility of [r]
being a tap and [ɽh] being a trill, which is a deviation from the commonly held
belief.
2.5.7 Area of Obstruction
The consonants dealt with above are some form of obstruent where sometimes ﬁrm
and complete obstruction takes place and other times narrow constriction are made
which produced quasi-random signals. The role of area where obstruction of the
passage occurs needs some understanding regarding the role of articulators in the
production. It has been noticed from detailed vowel-wise EPGs that the position as
well as the contact area is influenced by the adjoining vowels. The two important
measures are area of actual contact as well as area of constriction. Figure 2.102
presents the average contact areas of appropriate types for different consonants.
Velar stops are not included because the artiﬁcial palates do not cover the appro-
priate region. Similarly bilabials are not included because of obvious reasons. Taps
and trills do not exhibit ﬁrm contacts.
A perusal of the ﬁgures reveals that the area of contact/constriction depends
consistently on the adjoining vowel. The area is least for central low vowel [a]. The
area rises from low to high. For low vowels the vertical movement is larger and
therefore one may expect lesser time for the contact with the palate. This could be a
possible explanation. Further there is a general trend of increase in the area from
back to front, very sharply towards front. This is expected as with the front vowels
the contact for the consonant is made by raising the tip of the tongue while for the
vowel the portion near the root is raised. This indicates a complex motion for the

]
112 2 Consonants
tongue for front leaving lesser time for the consonantal contact. As far as the
articulatory positions of stops are concerned both the magnitude and the range of
contact area increases from back to front. Area of constriction for affricates is
consistently lower than that for ﬁrm closure.
2.5.8 Summary
For plosive/stops there is a general indication that contact region gets generally
forwarded on release by about one row, which is not very insigniﬁcant. It indicates
that the closure is released by a forward movement of the tongue. For retroflex
Fig. 2.102 The area of contact/constriction in the oral tract for different consonants
2.5 EPG Analysis 113
place of release advances two rows taking it to Post alveolar region from a
mideo-palatal closure. The dependence of the place of articulation with respect to
sex is consistent but quite moderate, generally forwarded for the female speaker.
The influence of vowels on place of release and closure is signiﬁcant. It is
monotonically forwarded from back to front, generally two rows, most backward
for /u/ and most forward for /i/.
It may be noticed from Fig. 2.1 that in EPG frame conﬁguration a single row
difference may sometime indicate different category in articulation. Therefore
identifying plosives/stops by the present system of ﬁne categorization may some-
times be misleading. For other sounds the problem is not signiﬁcant.
The EPG provides for the ﬁrst time a vivid visual presentation of the dynamic
process of the tongue-body interaction in the articulation of consonants. Though it
is intermittent it provides an unambiguous picture within its stated limitation. This
provides a new understanding that the place of articulation is not so crisp a cate-
gorization as one would like to believe from the traditional description and IPA
symbolic representation. In fact the fuzziness is so large in the case of retroflex
plosives/stops that one has to reconsider how to deﬁne them. The release is at one
place and the closure is at a different categorical place. Also the extent of influence
of vowels on deciding the place category is too signiﬁcant to be wished away.
A wholesome picture would come out only when this type of study is done with
larger number of informants.
One of the important shortcomings of the EPG system is that it does not provide
ﬁrm contact evidence for velar and dental region. The other one is that as of now it
is difﬁcult to have studies done with a large number of speakers. The false palate
has to made outside India increasing the cost and time. Once this is made in India
larger number of informants could be used. I am sure necessary technological is
available in the country. Only one has to tap them.

Epilogue
The entire work presented in this book has the underlying motivation to have
objective data and objective categorization on Bangla consonants which represents
the contemporary speech of native Bangla speakers in relation to the subjective
traditional description of scholars. The book attempts to consolidate the substances
of investigations carried out over about last three decades in different organizations,
particularly in Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and CDAC, Kolkata. It may be
quite possible that some work in some place may have been overlooked. If so, it is
regretted.
While manner based categorization seem to be relatively consistent and reason-
ably robust, that for the place of articulation is somewhat fuzzy. As speech is a
dynamically evolving subject, the traditional observations and categorizations need
to be evaluated from time to time. The number of speakers and the way the data has
been collected seem to be just adequate for representation of what is actually spoken
now as far as the acoustics is concerned. Of course it is true that more number of
informants, number of words, and use of really free speech would provide better
representation. This will, hopefully, be taken up in the future. On this respect the
present EPG analysis is really handicapped. The EPG analysis has been conducted
only on one informant of each sex because of the logistic constraints. One of them is
the cost of making the palate, which has to be done from abroad. The differences
observed between sexes are therefore only indicative. One wishes that the entire
analysis may be done some time over a comparatively larger number of informants.
But a more fundamental issue needs to be at least broached here. It is generally
said that for the development of technology precise objective parametric repre-
sentations are needed. When one talks about precision one does not necessarily
mean deterministic precision. It could very well be probabilistic with appropriately
deﬁned statistics. Speech technologies, particularly the ASR and TTS technologies
have to deal with high dose of subjectivity. Even the paradigm of stochastic
determinism seems to be neither adequate nor appropriate. In speech the subject is
too much entangled with the process of producing some objective reality, say
speech or songs. For example if a Bangla native speaker says /pin/ it is likely to be
heard as /bin/ by a native listener of London. Similarly the word ‘king’ spoken by
an Englishman is likely to be heard as /khiŋ/ by a Bangla listener. There are many

such instances. In fact it is said that there is about 40% of objective content in the
form of acoustics in the speech signal. The rest 60% of the knowledge to decipher
the oral message come from the listener’s brain. The acoustic parameters are
affected not only by the raw abstract phones but by many other highly semiotic
factors like syntax, semantics, pragmatics etc. Until one has the proper paradigm
one has to redeﬁne the objectivity from simple pointer reading to a process of
quantiﬁcation where the subjectivity is embraced deeply. One can only hope the
variations induced by subjects could be modeled by statistics.
Speech is a natural intelligent process. The context involved in the interpretation
of speech is also an intelligent context not merely a syntactic context. One would
need subjectively objective measures which can quantify sensory inputs like sound
waves into subjective evaluation of the objective fundamentals. This is nothing
new. Some such measures already exist e.g., sone, pitch, etc. It may be pertinent
here to mention the recent experiment of Hartmut (2003) establishing a relationship
between objective spectral characteristics with the subjective cognitive classiﬁca-
tion in the case of vowels. These involve psycho perceptual studies involving large
number of informants. One such experiment was reported here by the present
authors in the case of nasality of vowels. Such experiments need to be conducted
for all sound classes in the speech domain. This is likely to plug the confusion
between cognition and acoustics.
Be that as it may, one cannot sit idle till an appropriate paradigm appears on the
horizon. The development of technology cannot wait. One needs to use properly the
best technologies, including instruments and methodologies, which are available for
producing as a good a data set as possible which represent the speech and hearing of
native subjects. The researchers in Indian Statistical Institute and CDAC, Kolkata
tried painstakingly to evolve such a format and necessary paradigm over the years.
The present work emulates those. One may note here that in the last decade acoustic
phonetic data in a number of standard regional dialects are being collected.
Unfortunately they are dispersed at many places. Moreover each has their own
formats which are quite varied. It is necessary that a standard format and paradigm
is evolved for collection and presentation of such data. The author is not aware of
whether such a paradigm for Indian spoken languages exists.
The last but not the least is a few words about the impact of a book like this in
the knowledge domain of the nation. As far as the author believes that the students
and young researchers of linguistics in India is in serious need of a source book
which provides comprehensive details of speech acoustic, particularly of a Indian
dialect. The author hopes that this book may be useful for them.

A.24, A.25, A.26, A.27 and A.28 reveal that the place of release for all retroflex
plosives is post alveolar for the back vowels for both male and female speakers. For
front vowels the tongue tip is forwarded and the release takes place almost at the
root of teeth for male speaker. Also for female speakers contact place gets for-
warded but only marginally. The place of closure is post alveolar in case of front

vowels the place of closure is mideo-palatal. The closure, in general, may be
considered as palatal.
