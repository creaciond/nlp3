enough that this is a necessary compromise for large-scale surveys and does not in any
way imply that a typologist views languages as monolithic systems.
Languages vary radically with respect to number of speakers, and quite a few
of the languages cited in this book are nearly or perhaps already extinct. A collected
list of all the languages mentioned in the book and some macro-data for them can
be found in Appendix 2, including number of speakers as stated in the 16th edi-
tion of the Ethnologue. It should be kept in mind that the information stated in the
Ethnologue may be of varying age, which means that for some languages the infor-
mation is by now quite outdated. For example, a language that had only a handful of
speakers in 1983 may well have become extinct by now, nearly 30 years later. Notice
also that, unless otherwise specified, the population figures given are for the entire
number of speakers listed, spanning all countries where the language is spoken.
That means, for example, that the population figure given for English vastly exceeds
the number of inhabitants in the United Kingdom, since English is spoken in many
other places than there.
The language names given in this book are primarily based on those given in
WALS, whose editors have attempted to give the names by which the languages are
currently known, since older language names can be considered offensive by the speak-
ers of the language. This means that some of the language names may occasionally
differ from those used in other sources. For example, Romani dialects and speakers
were once known as ‘Gypsies’, a denomination now considered quite offensive and, if
anything, are only used pejoratively or as an insult and which should be avoided. In
case a language name contains a modifier, to indicate, for example, that it is a specific
variety of a language, or that it is a specific language of a group of languages, I give
the name with the modifier initially in the text, but list it according to the larger lan-
guage or group in Appendix 2. Thus, for example, Brazilian Portuguese and American
English will be stated as such in the text, but listed as Portuguese, Brazilian and English,
American in the appendix. Observe that not all languages containing several words
are names plus modifiers. Hawai‘i Creole English, for example, is the full name of the
language, as is, for instance, British Sign Language, which means they will be listed as
such in the appendix.
Sign language names are most commonly cited with abbreviations in the literature,
often with the abbreviation of the native language name of the sign language, even if
the text is written in English, such as DGS for Deutsche Gebärdensprache (German Sign
Language). I have followed this convention. In order to familiarize the reader with sign
language abbreviations, I have consistently given them the first time a sign language
name appears, even in those cases where the name appears only once in the text.
8	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
1.3.2	 	 Some remarks on the examples in this book
Most examples provided in this book are from languages that only the exceptionally
few will have first-hand knowledge of. Therefore all examples, except the English ones,
are consistently provided with morpheme-by-morpheme analyses and glosses, a prac-
tice called interlinearization, interlinearized morpheme translation or interlinear-
ized glossing, among other terms. What this essentially means is that each relevant
segment of the example is provided with a gloss. A gloss is basically an analytical
explanation of the unit in question. For example, the English sentence The dogs are
chasing the cats could be interlinearized as follows:
		 English (Indo-European (Germanic): UK)
	 (1)	 the	 dog-s	 are	 chasing	 the	 cat-s
		 def.art	 dog-pl	 be.pres.pl	 chase.prog	 def.art	 cat-pl
In (1) each word is provided with at least one gloss. The grammatical information is
given as abbreviations (for a full list of the abbreviations used in this book and their full
forms, see List of Abbreviations) and in small caps, while the bare form of the lexical
information is given in full and in lower case. Thus the first word in the sentence is
glossed as a definite article (definite.article), the second word in the sentence is seg-
mented into its lexical stem dog and the grammatical suffix â•‚s indicating plural number,
which is shown in the glossing by separating the two units with a hyphen. If a unit
is not easily segmentable, the lexical information is given first, with the grammatical
information following. Each component of the non-segmentable analysis is separated
with a full stop; cf. are and chasing in the example above.
The glosses generally follow those set up in the Leipzig Glossing Rules (http://
www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php). For more information about
the principles and premises of interlinear glossing, see Lehmann (2000). Different
authors may use different terms and abbreviations; while I have in almost all cases
followed the analyses of the sources, I have streamlined the terms and glosses to be
consistent throughout this book, making the examples more cross-compatible with
each other.
It is very important to keep in mind that the translations given for each example
are only the closest idiomatic equivalences to English. That is, a translation should
never be seen as an analysis of data, but merely the closest approximation of language
A into English. Since languages differ radically with respect to their characteristics,
various kinds of information are often lost in translations. Drawing conclusions about
the structure of a language based on translations would therefore be a highly question-
able endeavour. For example, German has four different cases, nominative, accusative,
dative and genitive, as well as three different genders, masculine, feminine and neuter.
	 Chapter 1.â•‡ Introduction	 9
This is not so in English and would therefore not show in the translations of German
into English, although it would show in the glossing. Consider the following:
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (2)	 der Mann	 the man	 die Frau	 the woman	 das Kind	 the child
		 den Mann	 the man	 die Frau	 the woman	 das Kind	 the child
		 dem Mann	 the man	 der Frau	 the woman	 dem Kind	 the child
		 des Mann-es	 the man-s	 der Frau	 the womans	 des Kind-es	 the child-s
If we base our analysis only on the English translation of the data above, we would
come to the conclusion that German, just like English, has morphological marking for
only one case, namely the genitive, which in German can even occasionally be left out
(cf. the last row in the third column above). We would also come to the conclusion
that there is in German, just like in English, no nominal gender. Both of these conclu-
sions would be entirely wrong, as can already be surmised from the differences in form
between the German definite articles. A glossing would show that the first row of each
column above is in the nominative case, the second in the accusative, the third in the
dative and the fourth in the genitive. Furthermore, glossing of the data would show
that each column represents a different nominal gender, the first one masculine, the
third one feminine and the fifth one neuter. In other words, it is important to keep in
mind that the glossing provides the analysis of the data, while the translation is sim-
ply an idiomatic English approximation that serves to give an idea what the example
means. It is also important to keep in mind that the glossing is not the data itself, but
an analysis of it. Thus different researchers might analyse the same data differently
and consequently gloss the same data differently. Furthermore, the same data may be
glossed with varying degrees of detail depending on what the author is focussing on
or considers relevant for the discussion.
In order to make examples immediately accessible, each is given with the language
name and macro-data (i.e. affiliation and location) irrespective of whether this macro-
data has already been provided in the text. For each example the source of the example
is given, allowing the reader to make further inquiries about the language or example
in question. Where I have not been able to go back to the primary source myself, I have
still included a reference to it in order to allow the reader to trace the data. In those
cases where I have based the example on my own knowledge or my own fieldwork of
the language, this is indicated by the source reference ‘personal knowledge’ or ‘own
fieldwork’ respectively.
Examples of sign languages are interlinearized according to more or less the same
principles as the examples of spoken languages. By general convention glosses for the
signs are in capital letters, not in lower case. I have followed this convention through-
out the book. Thus the sign meaning ‘apple’ is glossed APPLE. Sign languages provide
10	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
a host of information with other means than the hands, so-called non-manual signs.
These are usually indicated with a line above the signs that they accompany, with the
grammatical analysis indicated with lower case abbreviations. A non-manual marker
for negation accompanying the first half of a complex sentence, for example, would
be indicated as follows:
		 Constructed example:
	 (3)	 ______â•›â•›â•›	 neg
		 APPLE 	 EAT		 ALLERGIC
		 ‘He doesn’t eat apples, (because) he’s allergic.’
In (2) the glossing indicates that the signs made are ‘apple’, ‘eat’ and ‘allergic’ respec-
tively, and that the non-manual marker for negation accompanies the two first signs.
1.4	 The structure of this book
As mentioned above, the general structure of this book follows that of a descriptive
grammar, starting with the smallest linguistic unit and moving ahead to larger lin-
guistic units. The chapters in general build on each other, which means that I have
to the greatest possible extent tried to avoid using terminology and concepts not
previously introduced and explained. However, occasionally discussions have to be
made without providing background explanations for terms, most notably in the
introductory chapters.
There is no set model for which headings various linguistic features should be
discussed under, and different sources will organize their discussion differently. The
motivation for my organization is first of all to introduce issues gradually and in such
a way that the discussion can lean on previous chapters and sections. Secondly, as the
purpose of this book is to function as a course book, I have tried to make the chapters
of roughly comparable lengths, although different topics by necessity demand different
treatments and amounts of space. The chapters have a largely uniform format, starting
with a short overview of what the chapter is about, then dealing with the topic at hand
(including the pertinent issues relating to sign languages) and concluding with a sum-
mary. For each chapter a map of the languages cited in that particular chapter has been
provided, as well as at least one feature map graphically showing the global patterning
of a selected linguistic feature. The feature maps were generated with the ‘Interactive
Reference Tool (WALS program)’ developed by Hans-Jörg Bibiko, provided with the
printed version of WALS (Haspelmath et al. 2005) and available for free at http://www.
eva.mpg.de/lingua/research/tool.php. The tool includes a guide on how to use it as well
as such information as, for example, how to generate one’s own maps.
	 Chapter 1.â•‡ Introduction	 11
Throughout the book I have included what I think of as ‘curiosity boxes’, that is,
little insets bringing up rare phenomena or otherwise eye-catching issues not dis-
cussed in the text. These boxes are meant as glimpses of the fascinating mosaic that
human languages have to offer. In order to make these ‘curiosity boxes’ immediately
accessible, I have given the affiliation and location of each language mentioned in the
box, irrespective of whether this macro-data has already been provided in the text.
Chapter 2 gives a definition of linguistic typology and language universals. It
discusses the issue of classifications and why so-called ‘contact languages’ (pidgins,
creoles and mixed languages) as well as sign languages tend to be treated separately.
Chapter 3 brings up the methodological issues of data, language samples and data-
bases, as well as the issue of language endangerment, language documentation and
description, and methodological issues in sign language typology. These two chapters
provide necessary background information for those sections dealing with actual data,
which forms the bulk of the book.
The remainder of the book deals with cross-linguistic patterns of language data.
Chapter 4 gives an introduction to the basic concepts needed for studying contrastive
segments as well as syllables and suprasegments before moving on to describe various
phonological patterns found across the world, including sign languages. Phonology
has not previously been included in introductions to typology. Chapter 5 brings up the
notions needed to understand discussions on morphology, or the building blocks of
language, before giving an overview of the different types of morphological strategies
known in the languages of the world, including sign languages.
In Chapter 6 I first discuss by what means the lexicon tends to be enriched, that
is, various kinds of word-formation. I then discuss the notion of parts-of-speech, i.e.
word or lexical classes, and which lexical classes we tend to find in the languages of
the world, both spoken and signed. With the exception of Whaley (1997), systematic
discussions on parts-of-speech have not previously been provided in introductions to
typology.
Chapter 7 deals specifically with various processes involving noun phrases in spo-
ken and signed languages. After having defined what a noun phrase is, I discuss the
grammatical categories of number and noun class (or gender) before moving on to dis-
cuss syntactic processes involving the noun phrase. Chapter 8 then moves on to define
the verb phrase and specifically characterize and discuss the grammatical categories of
tense, aspect, and mood and modality in spoken and signed languages.
In Chapter 9 I give an overview of the core units and processes involved in simple
clauses, also in sign languages. This leads on to Chapter 10 where a brief introduc-
tion to syntax (i.e. the building blocks of sentences) is given before discussing the way
languages of the world, including sign languages, tend to organize their constituents,
both on a clausal and a phrasal level.
12	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In Chapter 11 I discuss various kinds of complex clauses, bringing up the notions
of and exemplifying coordination, subordination and cosubordination in languages
of the world, including sign languages.
Chapter 12 gives an overview of various pragmatics topics in the linguistic sys-
tems across the world for both spoken and signed languages, and brings up not only
different kinds of speech acts, but also the notion of politeness and how that may
affect the structure of a language. Pragmatics has not received much attention in
introductions to linguistic typology; this is especially true for the linguistic domain
of politeness.
If there is one indisputable absolute linguistic universal, it is that all languages
change. Chapter 13 therefore brings up the topic of internal versus external change in
both spoken and signed languages, specifically grammaticalization or how grammati-
cal categories enter the linguistic system, and contact-induced change as well as lin-
guistic areas. With the exception of Croft’s (2003) discussion on diachronic typology,
these two major domains relating to the evolution of linguistic structures have largely
been left out in previous introductions to typology.
Appendix 1 provides a selected sample of sites containing much information and
material of interest to anyone dealing with linguistic typology, both online databases
and other kinds of sites. This is by no means an exhaustive list of sites, mainly a starting
point for the interested reader to investigate and move on from.
Appendix 2 is a list of all the languages mentioned in the book, with some macro-
data given for each language, such as genealogical affiliation, approximate location,
number of speakers and the language code in the 16th edition of the Ethnologue (Lewis
2009), which will allow the interested reader to investigate further.
Finally, a glossary gives short definitions of the terms that appear in boldface in
the book.

Chapter 2
Typology and universals
Typology is the study of linguistic systems and recurring patterns of linguistic sys-
tems. Universals are typological generalizations based on these recurring patterns. This
chapter will give a definition of what typology is (2.1). Section 2.2 brings up the notion
of classifications, especially genealogical, and gives a brief discussion on why pidgins,
creoles and mixed languages, as well as sign languages tend to be treated separately
(2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively). In 2.3 I give a definition of universals and bring up the
concepts of unrestricted (2.3.1) and implicational (2.3.2) universals. Section 2.4 takes a
cursory glance at the motivations for language universals.
2.1	 What is typology?
To put it very simply, linguistic typology concerns itself with the study of structural
differences and similarities between languages. The term typology is, as many other
linguistic terms, borrowed from the field of biology and means something like ‘tax-
onomy’ or ‘classification’ (Croft 2003:â•›1), or, to be precise, “the study and interpreta-
tion of types” (Pearsall & Trumble 1996: sv). Linguistic typology, then, is the study
and interpretation of linguistic or language types. More specifically, it is the study
and interpretation of types of linguistic systems. While this may involve comparison
of linguistic systems within a language, it more generally involves comparison of lin-
guistic systems between languages. Linguistic typology can be both synchronic, i.e. a
comparison of languages contemporary to each other, or diachronic, i.e. a compari-
son of languages at various stages of their historical development. Impressionistically,
synchronic typology has received more attention than diachronic typology, but both
are equally necessary and can be thought of as complementary to each other (cf. the
discussion in Croft 2003:â•›232ff).
Any linguistic system may serve as a starting point for typological comparisons.
Thus we may, for example, have typological surveys of phonological, morphological,
grammatical, syntactic, lexical, pragmatic, semantic, etc. systems. Essentially, the ulti-
mate goal of linguistic typology “is to understand [the question] ‘what’s where why?’â†œ”
(Bickel 2007:â•›248). In other words, a driving force is to try to establish recurring pat-
terns across languages, in order to answer the questions “what is out there?”, “where
does it occur?” and “why do we have particular patterns?”. If we want to formulate
16	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
hypotheses about the unity, diversity, potentials and limits of human language, we
need to know what human language is capable of. Investigating only one language
will not be sufficient to answer such questions. For instance, if we look at English we
may establish various linguistic factors, such as what the phoneme inventory is, what
the morphology is like, what grammatical categories we can discern, how units are
ordered, and so on. We may then use these factors to hypothesize what the human
brain needs or does not need in order to allow a person to produce and maintain a
coherent language and communicate with others. Based on English, this might lead
us to assume, for example, that a human language needs quite a number of vowels in
order to get by. We might further assume that the only way to know what grammatical
functions the words in a sentence have depend on how they are ordered with respect
to each other. Compare, for example, the following:
	 (4)	 a.	 John called Mary.
		 b.	 Mary called John.
In (4a) John is the person who did something (John is the subject of the clause), and
we know that because John is placed before the verb called. Mary is the object of the
clause because Mary is placed after the verb. If we swap John and Mary the grammati-
cal relations also swap and Mary becomes the subject while John is the object, as in
(4b). Based on English, we would thus assume that word order follows a rigid pattern
of subject-verb-object. We might also assume that a subject must be expressed in a
clause for the clause to be grammatically acceptable, even if there is no physical entity
to be referred to. In a sentence like He swam, for example, He refers to some (male)
human or animal. He is the subject of the verb swam. But in a sentence like It rained,
we have a neutral pronoun filling the slot of the subject, even though It does not refer
to anything. Taking out the subject, however, is not possible; a clause like *Rained is
not grammatically acceptable.4 This might lead us to conclude that the human brain
demands that every clause has at least one slot for “subject” and one for “verb” in order
to be complete, even if the “subject” slot is filled with a semantically empty reference
(i.e. even if the reference does not have any concrete real world meaning).
Based on some other language, we might get an entirely different picture, which
would lead us to make an entirely different set of assumptions. If we base our hypoth-
esis on what a human language must have on Mandarin, for example, we would assume
that we only need a handful of vowels to get by, but that differences in tone is an
absolutely essential requirement of human language. Compare the four words in (5):
4.	 The symbol * means that the form or construction is non-existent or grammatically unacceptable.
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 17
		 Mandarin (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese): China)
	 (5)	 a.	 yī	 ‘cloth’	 b.	 yí	 ‘to suspect’
		 c.	 yǐ	 ‘chair’	 d.	 yì	 ‘meaning’  (Li & Thompson 1990:â•›814)
As (5) shows, the choice of tone (indicated on the vowel by the diacritics ˉ, ́,â•›ˇ and ̀
respectively) is an essential part of conveying the meaning of the word in Mandarin.
Furthermore, if we base our hypothesis on Mandarin only, we might assume that copy-
ing parts of the word, a process called reduplication, is an essential requirement for a
language to be able to form adverbs from adjectives:
		 Mandarin (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese): China)
	 (6)	 màn	 ‘slow’	 →	 màn-màn-de	 ‘slowly’  (Li & Thompson 1990:â•›821)
Both tone and reduplication are largely irrelevant for the linguistic system of English.
Based on yet another language we would make yet different assumptions. In
Modern Greek, for example, the order of the elements in the clause is not rigid.
Compare the sentences in (7) below:
		 Modern Greek (Indo-European (Greek): Greece)
	 (7)	 a.	 o	 skilos	 kiniyinuse	 ti	 yata
			 the	 dog	 chased	 the	 cat
		 b.	 kiniyinuse	 o	 skilos	 ti	 yata
			 chased	 the	 dog	 the	 cat
		 c.	 o	 skilos	 ti	 yata	 kiniyinuse
			 the	 dog	 the	 cat	 chased
		 d.	 ti	 yata	 o	 skilos	 kiniyinuse
			 the	 cat	 the	 dog	 chased
		 e.	 ti	 yata	 kiniyinuse	 o	 skilos
			 the	 cat	 chased	 the	 dog
		 f.	 kiniyinuse	 ti	 yata	 o	 skilos
			 chased	 the	 cat	 the	 dog
			 ‘The dog chased the cat.’  (Ruge 1984:â•›94)
In (7) the elements of the sentence (the dog, the cat and chased respectively) may move
around in relation to each other. The role of subject always stays with o skilos ‘the
dog’, because o skilos is morphologically marked for the nominative case. The role of
object always stays with ti yata ‘the cat’ because ti yata is marked for the accusative
case. Based on Greek we would therefore assume that while the order of the elements
in the sentence is largely irrelevant, morphological devices to indicate the case of the
nouns are essential tools for humans to be able to sort out what grammatical Â�
relations
18	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the Â�
elements have. Case marking is largely irrelevant for English and Mandarin.
Furthermore, based on Greek, we would conclude that an overt reference to a subject
is not necessary if the subject is not a real world entity:
		 Modern Greek (Indo-European (Greek): Greece)
	 (8)	 θa	 vréksi
		 fut	 rain.3sg
		 ‘(It) will rain.’  (Joseph & Philippaki-Warburton 1987:â•›23)
In (8) there is no noun or pronoun referring to ‘rain’ or ‘it’ (θa is a marker for tense
and belongs to the verb). In Greek, only an inflected form of the verb ‘rain’ is neces-
sary for the sentence to be grammatically correct. This would not be possible in either
English or Mandarin.
What I have tried to show here is that if we look only at one single language, or
maybe a very small number of languages, and base our hypotheses on what humans
require, or tend to need, or tend to avoid in their communicative tool called language,
we are likely to end up with assumptions that would not hold, given that languages can
differ from each other a great deal. Looking at a larger number of languages we would,
for example, see that, contrary to English, languages can easily get by with very few
vowels, or that some languages demand a very large inventory of consonants indeed to
differentiate between different meanings. We would find that some languages employ
very little or no inflectional morphology, while others demand extremely complex
kinds of inflections for sentences to be grammatical. We would see that while some
languages have a rigid word order, others do not. In other words, if we want to be able
to answer the fundamental question “what is language?” then we will have to know
what kinds of solutions speakers have found to encode meaning, i.e. what kinds of
systems their languages have ended up acquiring. In order to get hold of such informa-
tion, we need to compare between languages across both space and time.
Linguistic typology thus often involves cross-linguistic comparison, i.e. com-
parison between different languages.5 While the term ‘cross-linguistic’ as such simply
means “across languages” and can be used for a comparison between only two lan-
guages, I use it here and throughout this book to imply across several languages. With
cross-linguistic comparison linguistic typology can give an idea of how linguistic fea-
tures pattern across the world. Some solutions are common, some are rare. Typology
5.	 This is often contrasted with Generative Grammar, which approaches the study of language by
looking very closely indeed at one language or a small number of languages. Different approaches to
the study of language all have their merits and complement each other in the common quest to try
to understand the fundamentals of human language. For an accessible introduction to Generative
Grammar, see, for example, Carnie (2002).
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 19
can map the patterns, which may then serve as a starting point for investigations into
why we find those kinds of patterns. Typology can also serve as a guide to analysis of
languages.
Once there is a clear and precise classification of occurring patterns, a new pattern
may be evaluated with respect to existing ones. In diachronic [i.e. historical] analysis,
where pieces of the puzzle (living speakers, phonetic studies of them, etc) may often
be missing, typological work can be particularly useful in guiding the analysis in one
direction over another. (Blevins 2007:â•›110)
While the quote above focuses specifically on the importance of typology for explain-
ing sound patterns, the statement holds for any linguistic domain.
It is important to note here that typology is not able to establish what is possible
in human language, for the simple reason that not all human languages are available
for analysis. For one, it is not possible to include all of the roughly 7000 languages
currently known to exist in the world (Lewis 2009), because we do not have adequate
descriptions for all of them. But even if we did have descriptions for all the known
languages in the world, we do not have access to all languages that have already gone
extinct, nor do we have access to those languages that are yet to emerge. Thus typology
is about probabilities more than anything else. In short, linguistic typology is basically
about tendencies and by extension trying to explain why we get these tendencies.
2.2	 Classifications
A central concept in typology is classification. Languages can be classified according
to various criteria. We could choose to group languages by the number of speakers they
have, or by formality of the situation where the languages are used, or by the area they
are spoken in, or by the genetic affiliation they have, and so on. With linguistic typol-
ogy the classification is primarily based on the elements that make up the structure of
languages, such as sounds, words and parts of words, how these words are organized
with respect to each other, and so on. Thus we could say that Mandarin is a reduplicat-
ing language (while English is not) and is also a tone language (while English is not).
We can say that both English and Chinese are subject-verb-object languages. And so
on. When investigating correlations between languages, we may, for example, investi-
gate whether reduplicating languages also generally tend to be tone languages (they do
not, in fact; most of the reduplicating languages in Rubino’s (2011) database are listed
as languages lacking tone in Maddieson’s (2011f) database). Since the bulk of this book
is about what types of linguistic systems and patterns we tend to find across languages,
that kind of classification will not be discussed further in this section.
20	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Languages may, as mentioned, be classified according to their size. The languages
of the world vary radically with respect to how many speakers they have. The vast
majority of the languages of the world (94% to be exact, cf. Lewis 2009) are spoken
by a population of less than one million people. The eight languages with the largest
population size make up for almost two fifths of the population of the world. Most of
the known languages are spoken by fewer than 10,000 people (Lewis 2009). Classifying
languages by size, one may, for example, investigate whether linguistic complexity and
population size of the language have any kind of correlation. For discussions on popu-
lation size and linguistic complexity, see, for example, Dahl (2004) and the chapters
in Sampson et al. (2009).
Languages may also be classified according to social factors, such as the age, gen-
der, or level of education of the speakers, or the formality of the situation the language
is used in, and so on. We must always remember that language is used in communica-
tion between individuals. Thus the social context and a number of social factors such
as the image of the speaker and the situation of the language use play a role in how
language is employed. And language is not monolithic. The same language will be used
differently by the same user in different contexts. Likewise, the same language will be
used in slightly different ways by different users. For example, speakers with a higher
level of education may use their language differently from speakers with little or no
education. Speakers of one generation may use their language differently from speak-
ers of another generation. Women may use their language differently from men. Or
the formality of the situation may influence the language: it is unlikely that we speak
in the same way when we give a presentation in front of an audience as when we are
sitting at home in our pyjamas having breakfast (if we are at all inclined to speak in
the latter situation). The way such social factors play a role in the structure of language
is studied in sociolinguistics. For a very accessible introduction to sociolinguistics,
see Meyerhoff (2006). For a discussion on how sociolinguistic factors correlate with
linguistic typology, see Trudgill (2011).
There are many more ways in which we could group languages together. While
the above kinds of classifications are relevant for typology, two types of classifica-
tions are especially essential for cross-linguistic surveys: the genealogical affiliation
of a language and the area it is spoken in. This is because in order to make typologi-
cal surveys as representative as possible of the world’s languages, they need to be
controlled for genealogical and areal bias, or the patterns that appear might be due
to such factors as inheritance or language contact. For more on methodological
issues, see Chapter 3.
Languages may be grouped together by the location where they are spoken. This
is not as straightforward as it may seem. One question is, for example, whether to
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 21
group languages by countries they are spoken in. This may be useful for organiza-
tional purposes, but we must always remember that such things as country borders are
recent politico-historical artefacts that do not necessarily represent historico-cultural
or linguistic boundaries. It should therefore be kept in mind that a country name as
a location for a language merely serves as a practical shortcut for giving a rough idea
of where the language is spoken. Linguistic areas are more likely to develop where
there is much contact between people, irrespective of political borders. When people
are in contact, they are likely to affect each other’s languages somehow (for more on
language contact, see 13.2). People from areas that are remote and difficult to reach
are less likely to have sustained contact with other people. Migration patterns, which
would also be a factor of language contact, are likely to follow natural boundaries for
the simple reason that one is likely to take the less arduous routes in search for new
land. Very large areas with natural boundaries are continents, but within continents
we may have natural boundaries such as inaccessible mountain ranges. One may, for
example, investigate whether languages are likely to be more “unusual” or dissimilar
from others if they are spoken in areas that are remote or difficult to access in various
ways (in fact, Bickel 2006 has shown that languages in the mountainous areas of the
Eurasian continent, namely the Caucasus and the Himalayas, tend to be typologically
unusual). If so, it might be due to lack of contact with large migration waves in geo-
graphically more accessible areas that may have made languages affect each other and
become more similar to each other.
Languages may also be grouped together according to their origins. Languages
that descend from a common ancestor are grouped together into one language family.
This is done by rigorous methods of historical and comparative linguistics. Historical
(or diachronic) linguistics investigates how languages change over time. By comparing
languages we may establish whether they are related or not, and if they are related, how
close their relationship is. A common starting point is to look for potential cognates,
i.e. words that share a common origin. Without going into details, by using the various
techniques of the comparative method we proceed to group the languages according
to how closely related they seem to be. This allows us, as a working tool, to construct
family trees, where the parent language, from which the other languages originate, is
at the top, with the descendants branching out according to our subgroupings. It also
allows us to reconstruct plausible forms for earlier (usually unattested) stages in the
family, so-called ‘proto-forms’. In essence, with family trees we implicitly make the
assumption that languages are split-off branches from earlier languages, i.e. that they
are direct descendants from the earlier languages. Very simplified, we picture that a
language is spoken, and then various factors such as internal change and distance from
other speakers contribute to give rise to dialectal variation in the language. Eventually
22	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the dialects become so different that they have developed into different languages.6 In
other words, family trees generally assume one parent language for several daughter
languages. For a very accessible introduction to historical linguistics and the compara-
tive method, see Campbell (2004).
Central concepts in terms of genetic affiliation for typology, as we shall see later
(3.2), are the genus and the family of a language. The family of a language is the
highest level of the affiliated languages. An example of a language family is Indo-
European. Language families may be of radically different sizes and ages. The genus
of a language is “a level of classification which is comparable across the world, so that
a genus in one family is intended to be comparable in time depth to genera in other
parts of the world” (Dryer 2011d). That is, all genera across the world are hypoth-
esized to be of roughly the same age. The term, originally suggested by William Croft,
mirrors the taxonomic level of genus in biology, which refers to an obviously closely
related set of species (Dryer 1989a:â•›267). Examples of genera are Germanic, Celtic
and Romance. Some languages cannot be demonstrated to have any genealogical
relationship with any other language. These kinds of languages, called language
isolates, can be thought of as belonging to a family which is made up of only one
genus, which in turn consists of only one language. Examples of language isolates
are Korean (North, South Korea) and Ainu (Japan). Some language isolates consist
of varieties, or dialects, which are all mutually intelligible. An example of such an
isolate is Basque (Spain).
Since there are hundreds of language families in the world, and even more genera
that belong to these families, it would be impossible to list them all here. The ten major
families are listed in Table 2.1 (ordered roughly by size):7
6.	 It is not possible to give an exact definition of what a language versus a dialect is. A common rule
of thumb is that languages are not mutually intelligible, while dialects are. It is important to keep in
mind that this is a matter of degree. Furthermore, extra-linguistic factors such as political borders
also play a role. For example, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian are all mutually intelligible, but they
are considered different languages and not ‘merely’ dialects. Italian dialects, on the other hand, are
not necessarily mutually intelligible, but they are called dialects and not languages. It is thus best
to view it as a continuum on a scale, where on the one end of the scale we have speakers using the
same language (they understand each other without difficulties), on the other end of the scale we
have speakers using different languages (they do not understand each other at all), and in the mid-
dle we have speakers using different dialects of a language (they understand each other to varying
degrees). For more on languages versus dialects and the study of dialects in general (dialectology),
see Chambers & Trudgill (1998).
7.	 Individual language families and how they are structured can be a controversial issue. I am basing
my genealogical classification on Dryer & Haspelmath (2011) and Lewis (2009).

It should be noted that languages that fall into the same structural type are not neces-
sarily related or located in the same area. For example, both Welsh (Indo-European
(Celtic): United Kingdom) and Maori (Austronesian (Oceanic): New Zealand) have
the same basic word order of verb-subject-object (Dryer 2011r), but they are neither
genetically related nor located anywhere near each other. Nor do the same origins or
areal location imply that languages are necessarily of the same type. Welsh and English,
for example, belong to the same language family and are located adjacent to each other,
but have different basic word orders (the English basic word order being subject-verb-
object; for more on word order typology, see Chapter 10).
2.2.1	 	 A note on pidgins, creoles and mixed languages
Pidgins, creoles and other so-called ‘contact languages’ form a group of languages
that does not easily fit in any genealogical classification.8 This is because they do not
conform to the assumption that lies behind family trees, namely that a language is
a (neat) split-off branch from an earlier language and therefore essentially only has
one parent. Pidgins, creoles and other kinds of contact languages have more than
8.	 The term ‘contact languages’ is, in a sense, a rather meaningless term for two reasons: one,
because no known language is immune to contact and contact-induced change (see further 13.2);
and two, because languages such as English, Modern Hebrew and Persian, which have gone through
periods of intense language contact, are not labelled ‘contact languages’. In general the term is used
to mean languages that have gone through intense language contact and that cannot easily be shown
to descend from one single parent. It is in that sense the term is used here.
24	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
one Â�
parentÂ�
. The cover term contact language is meant to capture the fact that pid-
gins, creoles and mixed languages emerged in situations of intense language contact.
Very often the lexicon of a contact language mostly derives from one language, while
the phonology, grammar and structure derive from other languages. Most often this
occurred in situations where there was an urgent need to communicate and no com-
mon language to use. While the socio-historical situation that gave rise to an individual
contact language is unique for each language, there are some common denominators.
This section will give a very brief overview of pidgins, creoles and mixed languages. It
is by necessity a highly simplified sketch of how these languages emerged and should
only be taken as a very rough guide to the topic. For a very accessible introduction to
pidgins and creoles, see Holm (2000) with further references. For background over-
views on individual pidgins and creoles, see Holm (1989). A wealth of information on
individual pidgin and creole languages can be found in Michaelis et al. (2013).
Urgent need for communication very often arises in situations of trade. The trad-
ing parties might not have any common language and therefore make use of some
kind of a communicative bridge. If this communicative bridge is used more or less
systematically, a common linguistic variety emerges. The intense and large-scale trad-
ing that the European exploitation and colonization of both the new and the old world
involved gave rise to a number of contact languages. Not only goods were traded, but
also people, which led to large-scale (forced or voluntary) migrations. Slaves or inden-
tured labourers speaking different languages were brought to or sought jobs in plan-
tations and in homes (to, for example, serve as domestic labour) and had to quickly
be able to communicate. Very often the target language, i.e. the language that people
aimed to learn, was the language of the colonizers. In other words, in English colonies,
the target language tended to be English, while in Dutch, Spanish (Indo-European
(Romance): Spain), French and Portuguese colonies the target language tended to be
Dutch, Spanish, French and Portuguese respectively.9
There are no straightforward and uncontroversial definitions for ‘pidgin’, ‘creole’
and ‘mixed language’. I stress once again that the sketch provided in this section is by
necessity highly simplified.
A pidgin is a language that emerges when groups of people are in close contact and
need to communicate but have no language in common. Typically the speakers with
less power, for example slaves and workers, use the lexicon of those with more power,
such as the colonizers. The language that provides the lexicon for a contact language
9.	 An exception to this was the situation on the plantations in the German colonies in the northern
half of Papua New Guinea, Kaiser Wilhelmsland and Bismarck Archipel, where the German planta-
tion owners initially communicated with their labour in Malay (Austronesian (Malayic): Malaysia)
(because a large proportion of workers were recruited from Java), then later, when the labour became
more mixed, in the pidgin English which became Tok Pisin (Pidgin (English-lexified): Papua New
Guinea) (Huber 2009).
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 25
is called the lexifier language. The target language (or superstrate language) is usually
the lexifier. The native languages that the speakers with less power have, the substrate
languages, may influence the pidgin in various ways. All users, both those with more
and those with less power typically cooperate
to create a make-shift language to serve their needs, simplifying by dropping unneces-
sary complications such as inflections (e.g. two knives becomes two knife) and reducing
the number of different words they use, but compensating by extending their meanings
or using circumlocutions. (Holm 2000:â•›5)
A pidgin is thus typically a reduced language and nobody’s mother tongue.10
A creole is typically a pidgin or jargon that has become the native language of a
community. Very often this is the language of those whose parents or ancestors were
displaced geographically for various reasons. With the ties to the original language
and culture disrupted, the new generation that arises in these contact situations ended
up nativizing the contact language and making it into their primary language. This
process can be quite rapid; it is entirely possible that while the first generations of
people born in the new location may have spoken one or both of their parents’ native
language(s) at home, they used the contact language when communicating with their
peers.11 In other words, playgrounds, schools and similar kinds of domains were prob-
ably instrumental in the formation of creoles, and this formation can be as rapid as
a single generation. By making it into their primary language, these new generations
also often extended the language. This process, called creolization (or nativization) is
still a matter of much debate, and it is beyond the scope of this section to give proper
attention to the various issues involved. The main point is that a creole is a full-fledged
language that can fulfil any and all functions that a human language needs to fulfil.
This is in contrast to a pidgin, which tends to be restricted in use to only the situation
where it is specifically needed.
There are essentially two main ways that pidgins and creoles tend to be classified,
by lexifier and by region. Grouping pidgins and creoles together by lexifier would yield
such categories as, for example, English-lexified12 contact languages, Portuguese-lexified
10.	 This is of course a simplification. Pidgins may also acquire native speakers, especially in urban
environments, as is happening with Nigerian Pidgin English (Pidgin (English-lexified): Nigeria) and
Tok Pisin (cf. Muysken & Smith 1995).
11.	 This is what happened in Hawai‘i, as has been shown by Roberts (2000).
12.	 It is a matter of vivid discussion among creolists whether to analyse pidgins and creoles as dia-
lectal varieties of their lexifier languages or whether to analyse them as discrete languages that have
emerged in situations of extreme contact. It is beyond the scope of this book to discuss that issue.
The use of the modifier -lexified (as in English/Dutch/French/Spanish/Portuguese-lexified) is here
meant only to indicate what the main provider of the lexicon was, and makes no further claim as to
the genesis of the languages.
26	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
contactÂ�languages, and so on. Based on lexifier, such languages as Ghanaian Pidgin
English (Pidgin (English-lexified): Ghana), Sranan (Creole (English-lexified): Suriname)
and Hawai‘i Creole English (Creole (English-lexified): Hawaiian Islands) would be
grouped together, even though the socio-historical backgrounds differ considerably
between these languages. Alternatively, pidgins and creoles may be grouped together by
region, such as Atlantic pidgins and creoles or Pacific pidgins and creoles. This would
possibly mirror the socio-historical backgrounds better, since the way the populations
moved or were displaced was largely dependent on how the seas were navigated for trade.
For example, the regions on either side of the Atlantic Ocean were, among many other
things, linked together by the transatlantic slave trade, while the regions of the Pacific
were, among many other things, linked together by mass movements of workers signing
up as indentured labourers on plantations or signing up on ships as workers in the whal-
ing industry.13 Based on region, such languages as Hawai‘i Creole English, Tayo (Creole
(French-lexified): New Caledonia) and Yimas-Arafundi Pidgin (Pidgin (Yimas-lexified):
Papua New Guinea) would be grouped together, even though they each have different
lexifiers. Most commonly pidgins and creoles are first categorized by their lexifiers, then
by the region they are (or were) spoken in.
A different type of contact language is the so-called mixed language, which typi-
cally has two ancestors. The most common definition of mixed languages is that they
“emerged in situations of community bilingualism” and thus have split ancestry (Matras
& Bakker 2003:â•›1). This refers to different languages with quite varied socio-historical
backgrounds. One thing that unites them is that their contact situation was usually
different from that of pidgins and creoles. Very often the contact situation was one of
rather stable bilingualism, either due “to mixed households accompanying the forma-
tion of new ethnic identities, or through rapid acculturation leading to the adoption
of a hybrid group identity, or through continuous socio-ethnic separateness resisting
pressure to assimilate” (Matras & Bakker 2003:â•›14). It is common for mixed language
speakers to also have knowledge of the two input languages. In fact only one mixed lan-
guage, Michif (French, Plains Cree: Canada),14 is known to be used natively and “inde-
pendently of speaker’s knowledge of any of its source or ancestor languages” (Matras &
13.	 In fact, it might be interesting to investigate whether the different socio-historical and economi-
cal backgrounds of the Atlantic and Pacific trade regions entailed different kinds of demographic
migrations. It could possibly have been the case that there was a more or less balanced ratio of men
and women that got displaced in the slave trade of the Atlantic, while the indentured labour and espe-
cially the whaling industry might have led to a greater population movement of men in the Pacific.
If that was the case, it would be interesting to investigate whether that might have made a difference
in the outcome of the contact languages that emerged through these population movements.
14.	 Note that this classification follows that in APiCS and differs from that in WALS, where Michif
is classified as an Algic Algonquian language.
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 27
Bakker 2003:â•›2). Thus, many speakers of Media Lengua (Ecuador), for example, which
has its grammar from Imbabura Quechua (Quechuan (Quechuan): Ecuador) and its
lexicon from Spanish, are trilingual and also know Quechua (used with Indians outside
the community) and Spanish (used with non-Indians) (Muysken 2013).
In linguistics the name given to pidgin and creole languages may differ from the
name the speakers themselves use for the language. In such situations the language
name used by the linguist tends to reflect three things: the approximate location of
the language, whether it is a pidgin or creole, and the lexifier. For example many
English-lexified pidgin and creoles are called Pidgin by their speakers. Thus, in order
to be able to distinguish between Pidgin in Ghana, which is an English-lexified
pidgin spoken in Ghana, and Pidgin in Hawai‘i, which is an English-lexified creole
spoken in Hawai‘i, the linguist may call the former Ghanaian Pidgin English and
the latter Hawai‘i Creole English. This can be a sensitive issue, as there has been a
long history of condescension towards pidgin and creole languages, viewing them as
“broken” or “incomplete” languages. It is very important to keep in mind that these
are not inferior languages in any way. They are also not “bad” or “lazy” versions
of other languages. They are simply languages in their own right, just as Japanese
(Japanese (Japanese): Japan) or German are languages in their own right. It is also
important to keep in mind that the language name used by the linguist is simply a
shorthand version meant to clarify what language is being discussed and does not
necessarily imply that any assumptions are made with respect to whether the lan-
guage is an independent language or merely a variety of the lexifier language.
There has been much and heated debate of whether pidgins, creoles and mixed
languages constitute a distinct type of language as opposed to languages that did
not emerge due to intense contact. One of the starting points of this debate is the
so-called Language Bioprogram Hypothesis formulated by Derek Bickerton (see, for
example, Bickerton 1980 [1974]), which postulates that in the process of creolization
the speakers will resort to the innate grammatical blueprint available to every human
being, rather than carry over traits from the parent’s language, which as a pidgin
constituted an incomplete form of language input. One way of testing the hypothesis
is to systematically compare contact languages with non-creoles15 and see if they
actually do pattern differently from non-creoles or if they are just treated as separate
kinds of languages due to their socio-historical origin. This kind of testing is now
made easier with large-scale databases. In an effort to test the validity of whether
contact languages constitute their own type of language, I consistently compare the
patterns found in Michaelis et al. (2013) with those found in Dryer & Haspelmath
15.	 Here and henceforth I use the expression ‘non-creole(s)’ as a short cut for meaning languages
that are not classified as pidgins, creoles or mixed languages.
28	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
(2011) where possible in this book.16 Needless to say, the patterns that emerge from
the comparison between the two databases, whether similar or different, do not in
any way imply any value judgement about the languages that make up the databases.
The value of a linguistic system remains the same irrespective of whether it contains
or lacks a given feature. For example, to state the fact that Mandarin has tone while
English lacks that linguistic feature is merely an observation of the state of affairs and
does not in any way imply that English is somehow a ‘worse’ or ‘inferior’ or in any way
a lesser value language than Mandarin. This is equally true for comparisons between
contact languages and non-creoles as well as for comparisons between spoken and
signed languages (see below).
It should be noted that it is not necessarily the case that pidgins and creoles will
display the same kinds of patterns, given their different domains of use. However,
I have simplified matters considerably by treating the contact languages in Michaelis
et al. (2013) as a single group of languages when comparing them with non-creoles.
I stress that this simplification is a compromise made necessary due to space limi-
tations. For more on why pidgins and creoles should be treated differently, see, for
example, DeGraff (2009) with further references.
2.2.2	 	 A brief note on sign languages
Sign languages are languages where the communication is achieved not by way of
using the lungs, vocal cords and oral/nasal cavities to produce sounds, but by way of
using the hands, upper body and face to produce signs. Sign languages are primarily,
but not exclusively, used by deaf and hard of hearing communities across the world.
They tend to be minority languages in the countries where they occur, and were, until
very recently, to a large extent unrecognized or even repressed languages. For a long
time sign languages were simply assumed to be sporadic or haphazard gestures. This is
not the case at all. Sign languages represent as sophisticated linguistic systems as spo-
ken languages do. The difference is simply that they are signed and not spoken. For an
introductory overview of sign languages, see Sandler (2006) with further references.
Johnston & Schembri (2009), Valli et al. (2005) and Sutton-Spence & Woll (1999) are
very accessible introductions to specific sign languages (Australian Sign Language
(Auslan) in Australia, American Sign Language (ASL) in the USA and British Sign
Language (BSL) in the UK respectively), but also provide much general information
on sign languages and sign language linguistics.
Systematic linguistic research on sign languages only started some 50 years ago,
with the brilliant and highly influential Sign Language Structure by William Stokoe,
16.	 I am grateful to Magnus Huber for communicating to me the figures of the relevant features in
the Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures (Michaelis et al. 2013) according to their status on
27 March 2012.
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 29
published in 1960.17 Since then a wealth of research has been produced, mainly on sign
languages in North America and Western Europe. Sign languages occur all over the
world, but the majority are still poorly described or not described at all. For this reason
genealogical classifications of sign languages are not properly understood yet. In fact,
it is not even clear if family trees in the traditional sense are relevant for sign languages.
Most of the known links between sign languages today are based on the fact that they
are young languages that often emerged through special education systems for the deaf.
In a number of cases, special education for the deaf was first brought to a country
from abroad, including the importation of some influence from the sign language of
that other country. This potentially results in creolization of pre-existing indigenous
forms of sign languages, sign pidgins, or so-called “home sign” systems (the latter two
being less developed forms of gestural communication) with a foreign sign language.
For example, American Sign Language is believed to have arisen from a creolization
situation involving French Sign Language and pre-existing local sign varieties. While
relationships between sign languages can thus be posited on the basis of historical
knowledge, it is not clear whether these relationships can be considered “genealogical”
in the same sense of the term as it is applied to spoken languages. (Zeshan 2011c)
The following groupings of sign languages have been proposed (from Zeshan 2011c
with minor modifications):
BSL – Auslan – New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL: New Zealand)
Japanese Sign Language (NS: Japan) – Taiwanese Sign Language (TZS: Taiwan) –
South Korean Sign Language (SKSL: South Korea)
French Sign Language (LSF: France) – ASL – Russian Sign Language (RZY: Russia) –
Dutch Sign Language (NGT: the Netherlands) – Flemish Sign Language (VGT:
Belgium) – Quebec Sign Language (LSQ: Canada) – Irish Sign Language (TCE:
Ireland) – Brazilian Sign Language (LSB: Brazil)
DGS – (perhaps also other sign languages in Europe and the Middle East) – Israeli
Sign Language (ISL: Israel)
Swedish Sign Language (ST: Sweden) – Finnish Sign Language (SV: Finland)
ASL – Ugandan Sign Language (USL: Uganda) – Thai Sign Language (TSL: Thailand) –
Kenyan Sign Language (KSL: Kenya)
Italian Sign Language (LIS: Italy) – Argentine Sign Language (LSA: Argentina)
Chinese Sign Language (CSL: China) – Hong Kong Sign Language (HKSL: China)
17.	 In fact Barnard T. M. Tervoort published an even earlier systematic study of sign language as a
linguistic system with his Structurele analyse van visueel taalgebruik binnen een groep dove kinderen
(Structural Analysis of Visual Language Use in a Group of Deaf Children) (1953). Presumably the
impact was slightly less than Stokoe’s (1960) publication because fewer people can read Dutch.
30	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
It should be noted that sign languages may also arise on their own, without being
spurred by educational programs. Adamorobe Sign Language (AdaSL) in Ghana is
an example of such a language (cf. Nyst 2007), as is Urubú Sign Language (UKSL) in
Brazil (Kakumasu 1968) and Kata Kolok (KK) in Bali (Branson et al. 1996).
It is important to keep in mind that sign language names mostly simply indicate
where the language is spoken, as in British Sign Language, which is used in Great
Britain, or Deutsche Gebärdensprache (German Sign Language), which is used in
Germany. This should not be taken to indicate that they are signed versions of the spo-
ken language of the area. They are not. They are languages in their own right and can
be quite different from the spoken languages of the society they are located in. DGS,
for example, has subject-object-verb word order, while spoken German has subject-
verb-object word order. Sign languages are, however, in intense contact situations with
the spoken languages of the area. The absolute majority of signers must also be able to
function in the spoken language of the society they live in, if nothing else in written
form. For more on language contact between spoken and signed languages, see 13.3.
Sign languages constitute their own type by virtue of the difference in modal-
ity (using visual-gestural communication instead of audio-oral communication).
Including sign languages systematically in typological surveys and research will allow
us to investigate whether or not this difference in modality actually entails differences
in language structure. For this reason, and as a general appeal to include sign languages
systematically in cross-linguistic studies, a section on sign language has been included
in all the chapters dealing with typological data in this book. Since vastly more data is
available for spoken languages, the sections on sign languages are by necessity shorter
than the sections on spoken languages. Future documentation of and research on sign
languages is eagerly awaited and will provide invaluable information on the nature of
language as a human phenomenon.
2.3	 What are universals?
Cross-linguistic surveys allow us to study patterns that systematically occur across lan-
guages. Recurring patterns allow us to make typological generalizations and formulate
language universals. Language universals refer to properties that hold for all or most
known human languages. It is important here to keep in mind that the term language
universals, as used in typology, refers to quantitative statements that are based on
cross-linguistic studies. Or to be more exact:
Typological universals are empirically established generalizations that describe dis-
tributional patterns for particular grammatical phenomena across languages. These
distributional patterns are regarded as universals to the extent that they are found in all
languages or in a statistically significant number of languages.  (Cristofaro 2010:â•›227)
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 31
The term ‘universal’ is also used by Generative Grammar to denote a feature common
to all human languages, but there the claim is not based on quantitative studies.
Typology differentiates between different kinds of universals, which will be briefly
defined and summarized below. For more on language universals, see, for example,
Moravcsik (2010) with further references, which this section relies on a great deal.
2.3.1	 	 Unrestricted universals: absolute and statistical
With unrestricted universals we make statements about independent phenomena
in languages without any further conditions to those phenomena. That is, we simply
state that X is present in all or most of the known languages. Universals can be of two
types, absolute or statistical. Absolute universals are universals that hold for every
single human language, without exceptions; the assumption is that the feature must
be present in any and all languages. Statistical (or probabilistic) universals hold for
most, but not all, languages; the assumption is that the feature is likely to be present in
a language.18 Examples of absolute universals are:
	 (9)	 a.	 All spoken languages have vowels
		 b.	 All languages can refer to entities
		 c.	 All languages have ways of forming questions
The statements in (9) can safely be assumed to hold without exceptions. While (9a) is
not applicable to sign languages (but see 4.3 for an overview of sign language phonol-
ogy), (9b and c) hold for both spoken and signed languages. Examples of statistical
universals are:
	 (10)	 a.	 Most spoken languages have the nasal /n/ (but not Central Rotokas (West
Bougainville (West Bougainville): Papua New Guinea), which lacks nasals
altogether; (Robinson 2006:â•›207))
		 b.	 In most languages the singular is the base form and the plural is the overtly
marked form (but not Aari (Afro-Asiatic (South Omotic): Ethiopia), which
has no plural but an overtly marked singulative; (Hayward 1990:â•›444))19
18.	 Strictly speaking a statistical (or nonabsolute) universal is a contradiction in terms and should,
more accurately, be called ‘statistical tendencies’. It has, however, become a convention to distinguish
between absolute and statistical universals in linguistic typology. I will follow this tradition through-
out this book.
19.	 The terms ‘marked’ and ‘markedness’ tend to be used with a variety of meanings. In this book
I use it to mean ‘indicated’. An overt marker is thus an overt indication of something, i.e. a form
indicating some kind of meaning. For a discussion on the various usages of the term ‘marked’ (and
suggestions for why the term should be abandoned), see Haspelmath (2006).
32	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
	 (10)	 c.	 Most spoken languages employ a rising intonation for yes-no questions (but
not Hawai‘i Creole English, where yes-no questions have falling intonation;
based on own fieldwork)
The statements in (10) hold true for an overwhelming majority of languages in the
world. (10a and c) only hold for spoken languages, while (10b) holds for both spoken
and signed languages.
As mentioned before, it is simply not possible to include all human languages in
a survey. Therefore it is important to keep in mind that all universals are hypotheses.
Even if a feature is present in all languages investigated, and thus counts as abso-
lute, there is always the possibility that new data will reveal new systems and provide
exceptions to the universals formulated. It is then also vital that this data be made
widely available. For example, until 1977 it was commonly believed that there was
no evidence for a language with an object initial word order (object-verb-subject or
object-subject-verb), so it was argued that object initial word order was impossible
for human language. These assumptions were made despite the fact that there actually
had been reports of languages with object initial word order, such as Beauvoir’s (1915)
and Tonelli’s (1926) descriptions of Selknam (Chon (Chon Proper): Argentina).20 But
only with Derbyshire’s publication in 1977 on the word order of Hixkaryana was this
absolute universal widely accepted to have been proven wrong.
		 Hixkaryana (Cariban (Cariban): Brazil)
	 (11)	 yahutxho	 matkahekonà	 wosà
		 manioc.peel	 she.was.pounding.it	 woman
		 Object	 Verb	 Subject
		 ‘A woman was pounding manioc peel.’  (Derbyshire 1977:â•›597)
In (11) the object (yahutxho) precedes the verb (matkahekonà), which in turn precedes
the subject (wosà). Since then object initial word order has been found in a number of
other languages (for more details, Chapter 10). This, in a sense, shifted the universal
from an absolute to a statistical one. Despite the exceptions to the universal, it is, to
our knowledge, still rare to have the object clause initially. Thus a statistical universal
that hypothesizes that languages avoid object initial word order has not been rendered
invalid. It is simply not an absolute anymore.
While absolute universals need only one exception to be falsified, statistical uni-
versals are also possible to falsify, although that demands more data. For example, a
common claim in typology has been that languages that have object-verb word order
also tend to have adjective-noun word order, as in Ainu:
20.	I am grateful to Harald Hammarström for bringing these sources to my attention.
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 33
		 Ainu (Isolate: Japan)
	 (12)	 a.	 aynu	 kamuy	 rayke
			 person	 bear	 kill
			 Subject	 Object	 Verb
			 ‘The man killed the bear.’
		 b.	 pirka	 kewtum
			 good	 heart
			 Adjective	 Noun
			 ‘good heart’  (Shibatani 1990:â•›23)
In (12a) the object (kamuy) precedes the verb (rayke) and in (12b) the adjective (pirka)
precedes the noun (kewtum). However, when investigating a very large sample of 1316
languages, Dryer (2011x) found no significant correlation between the order of the
object and the verb and the order of the adjective and the noun. Statistical universals are
thus falsifiable, but it demands access to a lot of data. Hence both kinds of predictions
are testable and falsifiable, one of the main criteria for a scientifically viable hypothesis.
2.3.2	 	 Implicational universals
With implicational (or restricted, also called typological) universals we have pre-
conditions to the universal and make statements of the “if X, then Y” kind. That is, we
hypothesize about correlations between features. Implicational universals may also be
absolute or statistical. Examples of absolute implicational universals are:
	 (13)	 a.	 If a language has the phoneme /t/ then it also has the phoneme /k/
 (Pericliev 2008:â•›206)
		 b.	 If a language has reflexives for the first and second person, it will also have
reflexives for the third person  (Comrie 1989:â•›19)
In (13) the hypothesis is that the implications hold for all languages. Examples of sta-
tistical implicational universals are:
	 (14)	 a.	 If a language has the phoneme /n/ it is also likely to have the phoneme /m/
(but not Konkani (Indo-European (Indic): India), which has /n/ but no /m/;
UPSID:21 sv Konkani)
		 b.	 If a language has object-verb word order, it is also likely to have postpositions
(but not Persian (Indo-European (Iranian): Iran), which has object-verb word
order but prepositions; (Dryer 2011y))
21.	 All data from UPSID (UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database) is based on the inter-
face set up by Henning Reetz (http://web.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/upsid_info.html [accessed in
March 2010]).
34	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (14) the hypothesis is that the predicted implications hold for most languages.
Implicational universals can be either one-way or two-way predictions. A bidirec-
tional implicational universal is a prediction that works two ways. What this means
is that we can hypothesize that if a language has X, then it also has Y, and conversely,
if it has Y, then it also has X. An example of a bidirectional implicational universal is
(14b); a language that has object-verb word order also tends to have postpositions. That
means that if we see a language with object-verb clausal word order, we can expect it
to have postposition. But it also means that if we see a language with postpositions, we
can expect it to have object-verb word order. Furthermore, we can reverse the predic-
tion, and say that if a language has the opposite kind of word order, namely verb-object,
then it is also likely to have prepositions. And conversely, if a language has prepositions,
then it is also likely to have verb-object word order. The correlation works both ways.
Not all implicational universals are bidirectional. A unidirectional implicational
universal is a hypothesis that only holds one way. An example of a unidirectional
universal is
	 (15)	 If in a language the relative clause precedes the noun, then it is usually has an
object-verb word order while if a language has verb-object word order, then the
relative clause usually follows the noun  (Dryer 2011z)
The prediction in (15) only holds as a one way prediction. While it is possible to say that
most of those languages where the relative clause precedes the noun also have an object-
verb word order, it is not possible to say that if a language has object-verb word order,
then the relative clause will precede the noun, because there are many languages with
object-verb word order where the relative clause follows the noun. Nor is it possible to
reverse the prediction and say that if in a language the relative clause follows the noun,
then it will also have verb-object word order. The implication only holds one way.
2.4	 A very short note on motivations for language universals
It is beyond the scope of this book to provide a discussion on the motivations for
the various cross-linguistic patterns we see, something that could in itself fill several
volumes. This section makes no claim to do anything more than presenting a few
key concepts central to the debate on explanations for linguistic universals. For an
exceptionally accessible discussion on the motivations for language universals, see
Whaley (1997:â•›43ff). See also Croft (2003:â•›49ff), Haiman (2010) and Moravcsik (2010)
with further references, as well as Croft (2002) for a syntactico-semantic model for
explaining language universals.
	 Chapter 2.â•‡ Typology and universals	 35
It is a matter of debate whether explanations for language universals should be
sought language internally or externally. Language internal explanations are based on
the structural system of the language in question, while language external explanations
are based on factors outside the structural system of the language.
An example of a language internal explanation is the notion of iconicity, with the
principle that the formal expressions in a language express semantic notions. By this
notion the more complex the form is, the more complex is the notion that it represents.
For instance, book (one item) is a simpler notion than books (several of the item in
question), which is also reflected in the difference in morphology, where the simpler
notion has the simpler form and the more complex notion has an extended form
(plural â•‚s). For more on iconicity and markedness, see, for example Hawkins (2001)
and Bybee (2010).
Examples of external explanations for language universals are the roles of dis-
course, processing and economy. Discourse refers to a connected series of utterances
by speakers. Humans structure their speech in order to convey a coherent message.
The motivation to form a cognitively efficient discourse will shape the structure of
languages. In a passage like Jenny saw the man. She thought she had seen him before…
the pronouns (the referents) come after the nouns (the antecedents), which makes for
a more coherent message than something like She saw him. Jenny thought she had seen
the man before…, where the referents precede the antecedents. For more on discourse
and language universals, see Kärkkäinen et al. (2007) and Hopper & Thompson (1993)
with further references.
Economy refers to two processes: (i) frequently used elements tend to get
reduced, or, put differently, the length of a word correlates with how often it is used;
and (ii) elements that are highly predictable tend to get eliminated. An example of
(i) is that the shorter and is more a common word than before, which in turn is more
common than cardboard. An example of (ii) is a sentence like When John entered
the room Peter left, where the room does not need to be repeated because the context
implies what it was Peter left (so-called ellipsis). A classic on economy in relation to
iconicity is Haiman (1983).
Processing refers to the cognitive effort it takes to comprehend linguistic struc-
tures. Here the motivation for language universals is argued to be that those lin-
guistic structures that are easy to process are preferred. A sentence like Mary looked
the reference John asked for up takes more effort to process than Mary looked up the
reference John asked for. The latter structure is therefore expected to be preferred.
For more on processing, see, for example, Hawkins (2001 and 2010) with further
references.
36	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
	 2.5	 Summary
Typology concerns itself with the differences and similarities between linguistic systems, both
within and across languages, and investigates patterns of distributions of linguistic structures,
something which demands cross-linguistic surveys. Comparison of linguistic types may be ei-
ther synchronic or diachronic. Any part of the linguistic system may serve as a starting point for
typological comparisons. With its cross-linguistic surveys, typology may help show what kinds
of recurring patterns can be found, and as such may serve as a tool for testing hypotheses of
language and linguistic systems.
Classification is a central concept in linguistic typology, especially the genealogical affilia-
tion, primarily according to the family and genus. Languages are assumed to descend from one
ancestor and to have branched out from that ancestral root. The family is the highest level of
classification.The genus is a genealogical sublevel of classification that is intended to be compa-
rable across the world with regard to time depth. Since languages that are in contact with each
other are likely to influence each other in some way, the area in which languages are spoken is
an equally important classificatory parameter for typological surveys.
Due to their socio-historical background, pidgins, creoles and mixed languages are not eas-
ily classified genealogically. These contact languages have in common that they emerged in
situations of intense contact. Pidgins are reduced languages used in situations where there is no
common language between the parties and are typically not native languages to anyone. Creoles
typically emerge from pidgins and are native languages of entire communities. Mixed languages
typically emerge from stable bilingual situations.
Sign languages were not recognized as full linguistic systems on par with spoken languages
until the 1950s and systematic linguistic research on sign languages has only been conducted
since the 1960s. As yet there is not enough data for genealogical classifications of sign languages.
Sign languages may either emerge spontaneously or in controlled environments due to educa-
tion systems.
Universals are typological generalizations based on cross-linguistic surveys. Absolute uni-
versals hypothesize that a linguistic phenomenon is found (or is lacking) in all human languages.
Statistical universals hypothesize that a linguistic phenomenon is found (or lacking) in most
human languages. Implicational universals are hypotheses of the “if X, then Y” kind and can be
absolute or statistical. Implicational universals can be bidirectional, where the implication can be
reversed, as in“if X, then Y”and“if Y, then X”, or they can be unidirectional, where only“if X, then
Y”holds but where the reversed“if Y, then X”does not hold.
There may be various motivations for language universals, both internal, such as iconicity,
and external, such as cognitive processing, economy or coherent discourse.

Methodology
Sampling, databases, and how many languages
does a typologist speak?
All linguistic research is dependent on data in some form. For large-scale typological
surveys access to data is of paramount importance. This chapter discusses the various
kinds of sources for language data (3.1), with a note on the situation of the languages
of the world (3.1.1) as well as a section on fieldwork, documentation and description
of languages (3.1.2). Section 3.2 brings up the issue of sampling, including a brief dis-
cussion on types of language samples (3.2.1) and types of bias (3.2.2). In Section 3.3
I give examples of three rather different kinds of databases. Section 3.4 mentions some
methodological issues related to sign language typology.

40	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Perhaps the most off-turning question that a linguist has to keep swatting away like an
insistent mosquito is “how many languages do you speak?”. It is a question that I, per-
sonally, absolutely refuse to answer, partly due to the fact that there are certain times
of day when I feel I don’t speak any languages at all, but mostly due to the implicit but
unwarranted assumption that a person can only do research in languages that he or she
personally speaks. The implication, then, would be that all languages for which we have
data but that have gone extinct, such as Ancient Greek, Sumerian (Isolate: present-day
Iraq), Sanskrit (Indo-European (Indic): present-day India), Biblical Hebrew (Afro-
Asiatic (Semitic): present-day Israel), and so on, would be unavailable for linguistic
research because there are no speakers left.
All linguistic research is dependent on language data, and the more data is avail-
able, the more nuanced the investigation of it can be. However, data does not only
come in the form of a native or native-like knowledge by someone who also happens
to be a trained linguist. Furthermore, as was shown in the previous chapter, much
typological research is dependent on data from a high number of languages. Needless
to say, a typologist does not personally know all the languages that are included in a
database. (Oddly enough, a recurring question I have had even from other linguists
is precisely along the lines of “how well can you know hundreds of languages?”.) For
example, I made four separate surveys of various linguistic features while writing this
book (see 6.2.1.3, 8.2, 9.2 and 11.2.3.1), which, in total, involved 526 languages. I did not
learn 526 languages during the course of writing this book. What all linguists have to
do is to combine different sources for data. Apart from native speaker intuition and
expert knowledge, linguistic data derives from descriptions (primarily grammars),
elicitation and texts. Each of these sources has its merits and shortcomings, but used
together they can provide a rather detailed picture of a language. All of these sources
ultimately derive from various kinds of field- or archival work.
Language descriptions, especially descriptive grammars, are one of the main data
sources for typological research. The major advantage of descriptive grammars is that
they typically are comprehensive analyses of a language, done by either native speak-
ers or fieldworkers (who tend to become experts on the languages they do fieldwork
in) that are also trained linguists. Most descriptive grammars are organized according
to rather similar principles, which means that they are to a large extent cross-com-
patible. However, no language description is without its theoretical bias; no matter
how hard the linguist tries to be neutral in his or her description, theoretical premises
will sneak in. Such things as the way to go about analysing a language, how to get
started, how to structure the analysis, etc., all ultimately rely on one’s theoretical back-
ground. Language attitudes and the socio-political context of the language may also
affect the orientation of the grammar. For example, a native speaker of a stigmatized
language may unconsciously be biased towards proving the worth of the language
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 41
by Â�
establishing that it has certain kinds of features. Whether it is due to language
attitudes or theoretical orientation, there is always a risk that the description seeks to
answer such questions as “what does feature X or Y look like in this language?” or “is
this an instance of A or B” (cf. Gil 2001). The problem with such questions is that they
presuppose the existence of feature X or Y or that A or B are relevant categories in
the language in question. But languages differ and, as we saw in the previous chapter,
what is a relevant category for one language may not be at all relevant for another. Try
to imagine what the result would be if someone set out to describe the tone system of
English, approaching it with the question “which tones does this language have?” and
“do the tones of English have any semantic patterning?”. Since English does not have
tone, that would be a rather nonsensical endeavour.
Descriptive grammars may of course also be of varying quality and provide vary-
ing levels of details. Furthermore, a grammar is by necessity an approximation: first
of all, it is impossible to capture all facets of a language; secondly, for a grammar to be
publishable it cannot be of infinite length. Compromises have to be made. Therefore
very specific questions may not be answered in a descriptive grammar. Information
for such specialized investigations as my survey on expressions for ‘It is raining’ (9.2),
for example, may or may not be available in a description (for example, of the ca 800
sources I literally looked through every page of, I found the necessary information for
only about a quarter of the languages).
The way to go about finding data in a grammar of a language under investigation
is not only to read what the expert states about the language, but also to look at the
examples provided. Ideally the examples are given with morpheme-by-morpheme
glossing (see 1.3.2) and translation. When doing the survey of expressions for ‘It is
raining’, for example, I was mostly dependent on finding an example involving the
expression, since few grammars actually had a section discussing weather expressions.
Thus, when coming across an example like (16) below I was able to establish which
kind of strategy the language had:
		 Figuig Berber (Afro-Asiatic (Berber): Morocco)
	 (16)	 t-ttaɣ		 t-bica
		 3sg.f-make.int	 f-rain
		 V			 S
		 ‘It is raining.’  (Kossmann 1997:â•›249)
In (16) I used the translation to identify the expression I was looking for. I then used
the interlinear glossing to analyse how the expression was constructed. I copied the
example, including the glossing, translation and what the abbreviations meant, and
noted the bibliographical details in a file where I collected all the data. I also assigned
a value in a spreadsheet for the language based on the information I had found. This
42	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Â�
procedure was then repeated for each language that I investigated (as mentioned
above, however, only about a quarter of the sources I looked through actually had an
example that I was able to use).
An important consideration when doing typological surveys based on descriptive
grammars and similar kinds of sources is that the author of the description may use
terminology or define categories differently from the linguist doing the survey. It is also
important to keep in mind that the reader of the grammar is limited by the fact that
s/he is not likely to have firsthand knowledge of the language described. Each of us
doing a survey must therefore make every effort to understand exactly what the author
of a description means with his or her terms and categories. The combined information
of what the author of the description means and the examples given in the description
will allow the typologist to decide which feature value seems most appropriate for the
language. For example, the typologist may have a certain definition for a linguistic
feature, such as that ‘perfect’ should be used both resultatively and experientially (as
in Dahl & Velupillai 2011d). If a language employs what the description calls ‘perfect’
for only one of these uses, then the language will be coded as not having ‘perfect’ for
the survey in question, since it did not conform to the set criteria of the investigation.
The survey and the description may thus differ in their respective analyses; what is
crucial for a survey, however, is that the definitions of the feature values that are being
investigated are applied consistently for all languages.
Another source of data is elicitation. With elicitation the linguist asks native
speakers or experts with native-like competence pointed questions to glean informa-
tion about a language. Elicitation thus allows the linguist to ask about the particular
features s/he is investigating. However, apart from the fact that elicitation is extremely
time-consuming for both the linguist and the language consultant (also called infor-
mant), which makes it an impractical source of data for hundreds of languages, it is
also problematic due to the fact that it is not a natural language situation. The native
speaker gets questions that are isolated and pretty much out of context, and the answers
given, i.e. the data received, are likely to reflect this rather stilted situation. We have
all experienced that repeating an ordinary word or a sentence many times can make
it sound very odd (or, conversely, that repeating a nonsense word or sentence many
times can make it sound perfectly normal). Added to this is the so-called Observer’s
Paradox, a term coined by William Labov (1972) to capture the paradoxical problem
that the mere presence of a linguist will affect the language s/he is investigating, since
the mere presence of the linguist will make the native speaker more self-conscious of
his or her language, which will affect the naturalness of the language. In elicitation
situations the native speaker is likely to be highly conscious of his or her language.
Furthermore, elicitation depends on the questions the linguist can think to ask, which
means that patterns and features that the linguist is not aware of are not likely to be
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 43
captured, since the linguist didn’t know to ask for that particular information. The
linguist’s prior expectation thus shapes the information gleaned which consequently
makes the data selective. Another risk with elicitation is that the questions asked are
not typically formed in the consultant’s language, but have to be translated either by
the language consultant or by an assistant knowledgeable in both languages. This may
affect the data in various ways.
A different form of elicitation is to construct questionnaires, as, for example, Östen
Dahl did (1985). This allows the linguist to conduct multiple parallel investigations.
Questionnaires are essentially elicitation in written form that is further removed from
the interaction between the linguist and native speaker. The various problems that
elicitation situations bring with them thus also apply to questionnaires. Furthermore,
designing questionnaires in such a way that misunderstandings are minimized is an
almost impossible task. The risk is not only that the native speakers might misunder-
stand questions, but also that the linguist might misunderstand the answers. Another
point is that questionnaires will typically be designed in a language other than that
which the data is sought from. Last, but not least, it depends on getting hold of enough
language consultants and experts that are both willing and capable of devoting the time
and energy that filling out detailed questionnaires requires.
A third source of data is texts. With texts not only written records are meant, but
also longer passages of spoken language that have been recorded and transcribed.
The latter includes conversations, narratives, ritualistic monologues, and so on. This
data source is perhaps the most time-consuming of all, so much so that the sources
discussed above may seem as shortcuts in comparison (to quote Tim Thornes, p.c.).
Collecting textual data demands dedicated field- or archival work; many linguists
spend years and decades on the languages they investigate (for more on fieldwork,
see below). These kinds of texts are usually come by through recordings in different
settings, for instance conversations in familiar environments such as the workplace or
the home of the native speaker. This means that the language is likely to be more natu-
ralistic than in the artificial situation of elicitation. However, the Observer’s Paradox
is at play here too, even if at a lesser degree than in elicitation sessions, as the environ-
ment is much less contrived. Still, when recordings of naturalistic spoken language
data are being made, the language consultants are likely to be aware of the presence of
the linguist (unless unethical methods are employed, such as recording people without
their permission. Data of this kind should be avoided). One way around this problem
is to include native listeners in the recording session, or training community members
in documentation practices.
The Observer’s paradox would of course not play a role for written texts, but written
and spoken language may differ: with written language you do not have the benefit of fac-
ing the addressee, which means that you have to phrase yourself in a manner that ensures
44	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
to the largest possible extent that your message gets across. This is likely to affect how
you use your language. Furthermore, many languages lack a written tradition altogether.
With texts we usually have a larger amount of data, which allows for quantita-
tive analyses. However, not all linguistic phenomena will necessarily emerge during
a conversation or in a narrative, especially rare or specialized ones. Moreover, the
linguist may or may not be able to properly interpret a text or to capture the various
features and nuances through interlinear glossing. And again, the linguist is likely
to be influenced by his or her theoretical background (cf. above). Analysing the text
outside its original context may also hamper analyses and interpretations. Ideally, the
linguist would be able to consult native speakers to cross-check that the interpretation
is correct, but this is rarely possible, and is pretty much impossible when dealing with
already extinct languages.
In sum, ideally one would wish to have access to all three data sources, grammars,
texts and possibilities for elicitation. Unfortunately this is rarely possible, but “any and
all sources can provide relevant data when used judiciously” (Croft 2003:â•›30).
3.1.1	 	 A note on the situation of the languages of the world
There are roughly 7000 known languages in the world today (Lewis 2009). Of these,
fewer than a third have been adequately described (cf. Payne 1997, Romaine 2007, with
further references). By adequately described I mean that a full descriptive grammar
and preferably also a dictionary has been produced on the language. The remaining
(more than 70%) languages of the world have either only received sporadic attention
from linguists, or none at all, although intense efforts are being made by linguists all
over the world to try and change this. We thus lack written and recorded data for the
majority of the existing languages in the world. At the same time, languages are disap-
pearing at an alarming rate. While absolute figures are not possible to come by, due
to, for example, uneven distributions of census material, it is reasonable to assume
that at the rate things are going now, roughly half of the languages of the world will be
extinct by the end of this century (cf. Krauss 1992 and 2007).22 This is a state of much
higher crisis than the already alarming state of endangerment of biodiversity. And
just as extinction of plant and animal species is a threat to the well-being of our world,
so is the extinction of languages (cf., for example, Romaine 2007 and Hale 1992 for
discussions). With the death of a language, a host of human knowledge is lost. A lan-
guage is more than a tool for communication. It is not only the breath of a culture, but
also embodies the knowledge accumulated throughout the generations of that culture.
Specific ways of solving problems, of maintaining an ecobalance in the traditional
22.	 Some predict a loss of 60–90% of the currently known languages within the next 100 years
(Romaine 2007:â•›115 with further references).

Â�
territory, and of interacting with the world, from mathematical skills and perspectives
to agricultural tips and tricks and anything in between, will become embodied in a
language as it grows and develops with the community that speaks it. Language extinc-
tion is thus not merely a loss of opportunity for linguists to study diverse linguistic
systems, but also a loss of valuable human knowledge in general. For a very accessible
discussion of what the world loses when languages die, see Harrison (2007).
How to determine whether a language is endangered or not is not necessarily
straightforward. A “safe” or stable language typically has official state support, is used
in schools for teaching, is used in the media, and is probably also used in written
communication. It probably has a rather sizeable population of speakers. An endan-
gered language has a dwindling number of speakers, with fewer and fewer speakers
transmitting the language to the next generation (that is, fewer and fewer speakers
learn the language natively). Note, however, that size alone is not a guarantee for the
stability of a language. Navajo (Na-Dene (Athapaskan): USA), for example, has almost
150,000 speakers, while Faroese, for example, has fewer than 50,000 speakers (Lewis
2009). Faroese is at this stage not endangered: most Faroese children learn Faroese as
their mother tongue, use Faroese in school, write texts in Faroese, encounter Faroese
in the media, and grow up to speak Faroese to their own children. This is not the case
with Navajo. In 1968 about 90% of the first grade children had Navajo as their mother
tongue. In 1998, only one generation later, this number had dwindled to 30% of the
first grade children. What this means is that fewer and fewer children learn Navajo
as their mother tongue. Eventually we might have a situation where nobody learns
Navajo natively. That would make it a moribund23 language, i.e. a language destined
to go extinct when the last generation of speakers dies. For overviews of endangered
languages, see, among others, the chapters in Brenzinger (2008) and Miyaoka et al.
(2007). For a discussion on the causes of language endangerment and the effects of
language policies on endangered languages, see the chapters in Derhemi (2002).
There are many and varied reasons for language extinction, and in many cases they
are situation specific. The most dramatic reason for the world having lost languages is
genocide, the mass extinction of an entire culture. Other reasons include displacements
of a community, such as more or less forced urbanization due to socio-economical fac-
tors. For example, with the destruction of the environment due to pollution or defores-
tation, people might find themselves unable to lead a sustainable life in their traditional
territories, and decide to migrate to other places, usually urban centres.24 With that
they might have to adopt new languages in order to get by in the new environment.
23.	 These kinds of languages are often also called endangered, e.g. in Ethnologue (Lewis 2009).
24.	 In fact, this is another reason why we should sit up and take notice of the rate of language death
in the world: the causes of language death and language endangerment can actually be seen as an
46	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
They might further feel that the new language would give their children better oppor-
tunities for the future, opting therefore to not pass on their own native language to
their children. If this is done on a large scale, the community might end up shifting to
another language altogether and losing the original language. Another reason for lan-
guage endangerment is discrimination, such as forced monolingualism, which usually
derives from the power holder’s wish for uniformity (which is usually easier to control).
This can take the shape of forced assimilation, where a language is actively suppressed,
for example by meting out punishment to those who use it, or by assimilatory educa-
tion, where only the preferred languages are taught and promoted.
It should be pointed out here that language shift, which in turn carries with it
language extinction (because the speakers shift from one language to another, usually
from a smaller language to a dominating language), may come about as a voluntary
act by speakers. Very often this is because shifting to another language is expected to
yield better opportunities for the next generation. As Ladefoged (1992) points out, as
linguists we must respect speakers’ choices in what language they wish to speak and
not presume to know what is best for a community. My personal take on the situation
is that any kind of repression, among which I count forced monolingualism and forced
language shift (not to mention destruction of territory and forced displacement),
should be abandoned. While it is understandable that political administrations need
a certain degree of unity, there is no reason to suppose that multilingualism threatens
unity and stability. People are perfectly capable of handling more than one language
and can easily function in both an official administrative language and in other lan-
guages at the same time. It seems to me that people should be free to use whichever
languages they like (and choose where and how they want to live); forced streamlining
is not helpful, while voluntary diversity is enriching both culturally and scientifically.
3.1.2	 	 A note on language documentation and description
Language documentation and description serves a number of purposes. By docu-
menting languages we engage in amassing data for preservation. This will allow future
generations to access data for languages even after they are gone. Describing languages
provides information about them, and has the extended effect that the mere exis-
tence of the descriptions may be empowering for endangered languages. Both of these
endeavours are dependent on fieldwork of various kinds.
Fieldwork is essentially the procedure of acquiring linguistic data from language
consultants, preferably in environments familiar to them, such as their homes or work-
places. This can mean anything from interviewing a colleague sitting in the office next
indicator of ecological destruction, and thus a sign of a collapse of our global ecosystem, as pointed
out in Nettle & Romaine (2002).
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 47
to you, to going to some small community in a remote place to interview speakers
from a small, possibly endangered, language, or anything in between. The latter type
of fieldwork is what Hyman (2001) calls prototypical25 fieldwork, and is probably what
most readily springs to mind when hearing the term: a linguist spending an extended
amount of time with a community in an exotic place, documenting and recording a
little known language of a community with the help of local informants. But fieldwork
can also be carried out in one’s hometown, for example investigating the language of
a specific community in the city or investigating different varieties of the same lan-
guage in one place along various sociolinguistic parameters. Going to investigate the
language of the village your grandfather was born in is also fieldwork. A good general
definition of fieldwork is that it “describes the activity of a researcher systematically
analysing parts of a language, usually other than one’s native language and usually
within a community of speakers of that language” (Sakel & Everett 2012:â•›5).
Irrespective of where fieldwork is conducted, it involves a multitude of consider-
ations. First of all, people have to be willing to participate, to function as consultants.
Their consent to participate must be informed, that is, they must understand what the
whole endeavour is about. Many of the issues have to be considered individually for
different cultures. The issue of compensation, for example, can be sensitive in various
cultures. When planning for fieldwork, whether the prototypical kind or not, the lin-
guist will have to consider not only what s/he wishes to investigate, but how s/he will
be accepted into the community, how s/he will work with the consultants, and how
s/he will go about gathering data, how to make that data as reliable and comprehensive
as possible, and so on. A host of practical and logistical issues need to be solved, such
as getting to the place, staying there, getting permission to work with human subjects,
what kinds of equipment to use, and so on. For exceptionally accessible introductions
to fieldwork for beginners, see Crowley (2007), which mainly focuses on the proto-
typical kind of fieldwork, and Sakel & Everett (2012), which gives guidelines also for
other kinds of fieldwork.
Fieldwork allows us to carry out two very important separate yet interrelated
tasks: to document a language and to describe it. Language documentation essen-
tially means the collection of raw data that may then be used for further analysis.
This means that the investigator collects field notes, makes recordings of naturalistic
speech, conducts interviews and elicitations, records and observes participants, and
so on. To make the data available it will have to be transcribed and translated, which
25.	 The term prototypical essentially means ‘most typical example’. For instance, a prototypical bird
is an animal with wings, two feet, a beak and feathers; it lays eggs and can fly. Some birds conform
to all these values, such as robins and seagulls. Other birds do not completely conform to the typical
example; penguins, for example, do not fly. A robin is thus a prototypical example of a bird, while a
penguin is not.
48	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
by necessity involves some analysis of it. But by and large the purpose of language
documentation is simply to preserve representative samples of the language, prefera-
bly a sizeable amount, so that specialists (both linguists, anthropologists, sociologists,
historians, etc.) can work on the language, but also so that the language community
itself has a record of its language for posteriority. The merits of language documenta-
tion is thus not only to give linguists raw data to work with, but also to preserve a
cultural heritage of the community. Language documentation may also serve as the
basis for awareness and revitalization programs, by, for example, serving as a base for
teaching materials (see below).
While language documentation may not slow the rate of language death, it will,
at the very least, preserve records of the languages for future generations. An example
of a large scale language documentation program is The Rosetta Project (http://roset-
taproject.org/), where information for over 1500 languages is currently stored, much
of it publicly available. In principle this can be thought of as a kind of museum for
languages. A special feature of the Rosetta Project is that the information for each lan-
guage follows a set format, so that the information for every language parallels that of
other languages. By having the same kinds of texts and set of vocabulary, the informa-
tion is highly compatible for cross-linguistic comparison, which makes it an invaluable
tool for typological research. For a wealth of information about language documenta-
tion and how to go about it, see the chapters in Gippert et al. (2006) and the further
links at the official webpage of the book (http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/ld/). The open
access journal Language Documentation and Conservation (http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/
ldc/) publishes articles on a wide variety of topics relating to language documentation.
Language description is a separate, yet interrelated, task from language documen-
tation. A description seeks to illustrate the essentials of a language, based on available
material. It provides analyses of a variety of areas of the language, such as its phonolog-
ical, morphological, grammatical and syntactic systems, as well as, ideally, presenting
a lexicon of the language. Ideally the description is general enough to be comparable
with other descriptions (allowing for cross-linguistic research), but specific enough to
capture the uniqueness of the language (Lehmann 1999:â•›6). While language descrip-
tions are extremely important tools for linguists, they have a more limited range of uses
for people outside the linguistic community. This is not to say that language descrip-
tions do not, for example, benefit the community of the language. The fact that the lan-
guage has been described, that books such as grammars and dictionaries “prove” that
the language is viable and worthy of respect (Payne 1997), has actually helped lessen
the stigmatization of endangered languages and helped raise awareness for the value
of them, which in turn has led to a higher sense of pride of the communities for the
languages. The combined effect of descriptions and documentations may thus lead to a
higher recognition, even on a political level, of the language. Reference materials, such
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 49
as educational material, produced in combination with descriptive materials, might
lead to a higher awareness, and might even lead to the language becoming recognized
enough to be taught in schools. This might lead to the language getting a higher status,
which in turn might lead to fewer people switching away from it. For a very accessible
guide on how to describe a language, see, for example, Payne (1997). Very helpful tips
and suggestions on the various methodological issues involved in writing grammars
are the collected papers in Payne & Weber (2007).
3.2	 Sampling
As must have become abundantly clear by now, typological surveys are dependent on
data from different languages, often from a large number of languages. To include all
human languages in an investigation is simply not possible, as discussed above. Not
only do we not have access to all human languages, since we have data for only very
few of those languages that have already gone extinct, and no data at all for those that
are yet to emerge, but we also have limited access to the existing languages of the world.
While new descriptions of previously undescribed languages are constantly being
done, the majority of the world’s languages still remain either poorly described or
not described at all. Conducting fieldwork on the thousands of languages that remain
poorly or not at all documented in order to include them in one’s investigation is not
humanly possible. Therefore one must choose a sample of languages and infer the
patterns from that sample. It is thus important to keep in mind at all times that state-
ments about cross-linguistic patterns, tendencies and universals are always based on a
sample of languages. In order to make a sample as representative as possible, a number
of factors need to be considered. This section will outline the basic principles for dif-
ferent kinds of samples. It is by necessity a brief outline; for a discussion on language
sampling, see Bakker (2010), which this section relies a great deal on. A detailed dis-
cussion of sampling methods and the various issues related to them can also be found
in Song (2001:â•›17ff).
3.2.1	 	 Types of samples
The type of sample to choose largely depends on the type of investigation to be con-
ducted. In order to check for statistical tendencies and correlations of various features,
that is, whether languages tend to prefer a certain word order or a certain kind of
morphological strategy, and so on, we need a probability sample. Here we have set the
variables (also called features, characters, or parameters, among other terms) before-
hand and map the sample according to presence or absence of those variables. For
example, we may want to check patterns for reduplication. We may then choose a set
50	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
of variablesÂ�
, such as (i) the language does not have reduplication; (ii) the language has
partial reduplication only; (iii) the language has full reduplication only; and (iv) the
language has both partial and full reduplication. We then proceed to code each language
of the sample according to those variables, choosing only one variable per language.
For this kind of sample it is especially important to have genealogical and areal balance,
since the strategy a language has is likely to be inherited, but may also be prone to diffu-
sion (to spread via language contact). A genetically or areally biased sample would then
give biased numbers and patterns. Types of bias will be discussed below.
A variety sample is “mainly used for explorative research: when little is known
about the form or construction under investigation it is important that the sample
offers a maximum degree of variation of the linguistic parameters [i.e. variables]
involved” (Rijkhoff & Bakker 1998:â•›265). In a sense this can be likened to a kind of
snapshot of the diversity and distribution of a feature. Therefore this kind of sample
must above all seek to include all possible (known) variables. This is generally done
in stages: at first the linguist may not know what kinds of variation there might be
for the linguistic feature under investigation, so s/he sets up a genetically and areally
diverse sample. If it turns out that there are many unique cases for the feature, the
sample may be enlargened to try and capture undetected values. Here languages may
have the same origin, as long as they have different values for the feature in question;
this may result in genealogically or areally biased samples (cf. Bickel 2008). What is
crucial is to try and capture all (or at least as many as possible) values for the feature
that is being investigated.
A convenience sample is a sample based on what kind of data one has access to.
While a typologist may set up as fancy a sample as s/he likes, in the end access to data
will play a big role in what goes in. Obviously, if there is no information available for
the desired language, it simply cannot be included in the sample. However, while we
are not able to select data for which there are no descriptions (and hence are to vari-
ous degrees forced to construct convenience samples), we can still try to make these
convenience samples as genealogically and areally balanced as possible.
3.2.2	 	 Types of bias
In order for a sample to be as representative as possible, we wish to avoid that it is
biased, since a biased sample is likely to affect the result of the survey in various ways.
For language samples there are various factors that can make a sample biased, the
most significant ones being genetic, areal, typological, cultural, and, very frustratingly,
bibliographical bias. As has been repeatedly mentioned, adequate linguistic descrip-
tions are lacking for the majority of the languages of the world. The descriptions that
we do have tend to be of well-known, accessible languages, which means that small or
remotely located languages, very often isolates or languages of unknown affiliationsÂ�
,
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 51
are (bibliographically) biased towards exclusion from the samples. For instance, as
mentioned in Chapter 2, until Derbyshire (1977) published his description of the
Hixkaryana word order, object initial languages were not to be found in any surveys
on types of word order. Likewise, any survey checking for how many stop contrasts
languages could have in the coronal area would have assumed that languages could
only have a maximum of three contrasts, until Heath’s (1984) grammar of Nunggubuyu
(Australian (Nunggubuyu): Australia) was published, showing that Nunggubuyu has
four phonemic coronal stops: dental, alveolar, palato-alveolar and retroflex.
A genetic (or genealogical) bias means that some language families are overrepre-
sented while others are underrepresented in the sample. This is in many cases an effect
of bibliographical bias, since a researcher will include the material that is available. But
if material is primarily available from a small selection of language families, the sample
will be biased to that effect. For example, there is a great deal of material available for
Indo-European languages, especially European ones, but less available for Khoisan or
Australian languages.
Many features of a language are inherited. If a sample is biased towards one fam-
ily over others, a feature might look more or less common than it actually is, simply
because of how it appears in the dominating family. Tone, for example, is not a com-
mon feature in Indo-European languages, but it is quite common in Niger-Congo
languages. If a sample has a higher proportion of Indo-European languages than other
families, the pattern that is likely to emerge is that tone seems less common cross-
linguisticallyÂ�than it actually is (which, in fact, is the case with Maddieson’s 2011f
survey, as he himself points out).
An areal bias means that languages from the same linguistic area are overrepre-
sented, which again may skew the resulting pattern one way or another. Linguistic
areas (Sprachbunde) are areas where languages have been in sustained contact and have
influenced each other so that they have specific features not found in the languages
outside the area (see further 13.2). For example, the languages of the Balkan area, which
belong to different genera of Indo-European, have postposed articles as opposed to
the neighbouring languages outside the linguistic area, and as opposed to other lan-
guages of the same genera. They also have a specific type of analytic future tense, again
as opposed to the languages outside the Balkan area, or the other languages of their
genera. It would be premature to base any kind of hypothesis as to the correlation
between these two features before checking if other languages in the world also exhibit
similar kinds of correlations, because the reason that the two features emerged among
the languages in the Balkan area is probably due to the shared history and contact
between the languages, not because these two phenomena tend to go hand-in-hand
cross-linguistically.
52	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
A typological bias means that one linguistic type is over- or underrepresented
in a sample. For example, if we want to investigate an implication of some kind (“if
X, then Y”), then we need to make sure that the various known types of X and Y are
represented. Thus, if we want to check if there is any correlation between adposition
and verb-object word order, we need to include languages of all types, i.e. those with
prepositions, those with postpositions, and those with inpositions and check each of
them against languages with verb-object word order as well as check each of them with
languages with object-verb word order. If we have an overrepresentation of languages
with, for example, prepositions, we are likely to get a skewed pattern.
With cultural bias we have an over- or underrepresentation of the different cul-
tures of the world in the sample. It seems reasonable to assume that there is “a relation
between certain aspects of the grammar of a language on the one hand and beliefs
and practices of its speakers on the other hand” (Bakker 2010:â•›108). For example, in a
study on number marking, Lucy (1992) found that speakers of American English and
speakers of Yucatec (Mayan (Mayan): Mexico) treat nouns differently: the English
speakers make a sharp distinction between mass and count nouns, and have obligatory
number marking for count nouns, whereas the Yucatec speakers treat most nouns as
mass nouns, have optional number marking but an obligatory numeral classifier sys-
tem (based primarily on the material of the object). In extra-linguistic tasks, such as
looking at pictures and then later describing them from memory, the speakers of the
two groups paid attention to and remembered different things. The English speakers
were more likely than the Yucatec speakers to remember the number of objects on the
pictures, especially with respect to objects that constitute count nouns. Also, while the
English speakers were more likely to pay attention to and remember the shape of the
different objects, the Yucatec were more likely to pay attention to and remember the
material composition of the different objects. Similarly, when asked to sort pictures of
objects, the English speakers tended to sort objects by shape, while the Yucatec speak-
ers tended to sort objects by material composition. Thus the way the culture interprets
objects, and the way the language of the culture marks for number, seems to correlate.26
It is not likely that we will ever be able to create a completely balanced sample.
For one thing, bibliographical bias will continue to affect the choice of languages for a
sample. However, most of us try to control for areal and, above all, genealogical bias,
the latter being especially relevant because “if languages are closely related genetically,
they are likely to have inherited common linguistic types from their ancestor language,
26.	 Whether the number marking system derives from the cultural outlook (i.e. how one views
and categorizes objects) or whether the cultural interpretation of objects derives from the linguistic
structure, is probably impossible to establish. In any case the culture and language of a community
go hand-in-hand and are expressions of each other.
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 53
to be spoken in the same area and by people sharing the same culture” (Cristofaro
2005:â•›91).
Ideally, of course, statistically valid statements should be based on randomly sam-
pled data. But because of the nature of linguistic data, this is not practical, since this
might lead to areally skewed patterns, as we might end up choosing languages that
are in intense contact and might therefore share features due to diffusion rather than
inheritance or anything else:
for example, when random sampling happens to pick Romansch [(Indo-European:
Switzerland)] as the sole representative of Romance and High Alemannic [(Indo-
European: Switzerland)] as the sole representative of Germanic, this will overestimate
areal effects in Europe because the two languages are under much more intense contact
with each other than, say Portuguese and Swedish. In response to this one might chose
to admit several languages from each stratum [i.e. genus] in the hope of reducing such
effects. However, this option is severely limited because about a third of the proven
stocks [i.e. families] in the world are isolates. Since strata [i.e. genera] need to contain
the same number of languages, the inclusion of isolates implies that only one datapoint
can be admitted for each stratum, even for non-isolates like Romance and Germanic.
 (Bickel 2008:â•›222)
The above two sections serve to highlight the various problems and considerations
involved in constructing samples and trying to avoid bias. As mentioned above, a
sample completely free of bias is unlikely to come by. It should be noted that I will be
making extensive use of existing databases and surveys and will be quoting the pat-
terns found therein wholesale, without controlling for bias. In other words, I leave the
responsibility of the sample compilation to the author(s) quoted. The reader should
therefore be aware of the potential bias in samples quoted (for a discussion on WALS
and APiCS in particular, see below). This should in no way be taken to imply that a
biased sample is without any value. On the contrary: it still brings us forward in our
understanding of the complexity of language.
On a final note, statistics may seem far removed from typology, but is actually
pretty essential, since what we are dealing with is sets of data, samples aimed at repre-
senting the whole (the so-called ‘population’, i.e. the entire collection of what we are
investigating, in our case the languages of the world), and drawing conclusions from
these sampled data. For an introduction to statistics for linguists, see, for example,
Gries (2009).
54	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
3.3	 Databases
For the last number of years databases have increasingly become publicly available, a
practice which is highly beneficial for both compilers and the linguistic community (as
well as the general public) and is a trend that should be encouraged. Publicly available
databases are a great benefit for research, making scores of data accessible. They also
allow the compilers to be recognized for their painstaking work. Another great advan-
tage of making databases available online is that they can continuously be updated;
not only can errors that have been detected be corrected, but as new material becomes
available and as new insights emerge, data can be added or modified according to the
latest state of affairs.
Any database will involve compromises, which means that databases may differ
radically from each other, both in selection of languages and in the approach to the
entries. There are databases with a vast amount of languages, but where the data pro-
vided for each language is quite restricted. There are databases providing very elaborate
information for each language, but the number of languages is then smaller. There are
databases which look only at one specific linguistic domain, while other databases code
a host of features and information about the language. The following will discuss the
respective merits and shortcomings of three quite different kinds of databases that are
publicly available, all of which I have been or am personally part of and thus have direct
experience with not only as a user but also as a contributor. There are many more very
informative and valuable databases either already publicly available or projected to be
available in the near future (see Appendix 1).
A milestone in terms of large-scale databases is the World Atlas of Language
Structures (WALS), which started in 1999 as a collaborative effort between experts of
different linguistic features. What WALS did was essentially to pull together a number
of databases into one single unit, covering a great part of the abstract linguistic system
of a language. The chapters range from phonological features, over morphology, gram-
mar, and syntax, to lexical features and provide the first world-wide collected mapping
of language systems. Another groundbreaking aspect of WALS is its inclusion of two
chapters on sign languages. For WALS each linguistic feature was dealt with separately,
i.e. authors used their definitions and expertise to map a specific feature and each chap-
ter basically consisted of one feature. To make the maps cross-compatible, a sample of
100 languages that each chapter had to include was set up by the editors of the project.
An extended sample of a further 100 languages (making the total 200) was encouraged
to be included if possible. The instructions for the authors were basically to map their
features for a set core sample of languages. The sample was chosen with the inten-
tion to maximize areal and genealogical distribution of the languages within the con-
fines of available descriptions. Thus a minimal core sample of 100 languages allows for
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 55
Â�
investigations of correlations between features. Very often many more languages over-
lap between the chapters. Furthermore, the atlas provides metadata for each language
included, specifically the location of the language and its genealogical classification.
Because authors were responsible for individual features, their chapters may con-
tain a large amount of languages, though these may not necessarily overlap with other
chapters. As a result, even though the total amount of languages in WALS is very large,
with 2559 for the printed version and 2678 for the current online version, the range
of overlap between chapters can vary considerably. This means that despite the high
number of total languages, there are instances when combinations of features only
yield the obligatory 100 sample. In other words, while one can find information on all
the 142 (144 in the current online version) features for some languages, such as English,
Turkish (Altaic (Turkic): Turkey) or Lavukaleve (Solomons East Papuan (Lavukaleve):
Solomon Islands), there are other languages that only occur in one or a few chapters.
As mentioned above, while the core sample was as balanced as possible at the time
(1999), it was by necessity a convenience sample and therefore has a certain amount of
bias towards Eurasian families (for a discussion on the balance of the WALS sample,
see Hammarström 2009). Furthermore, it almost completely ignored pidgin, creole
and mixed languages.
In contrast to WALS, in the Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures(APiCS),
the first large-scale typological project for pidgin and creole languages,27 the authors
were responsible for a language while the features that were being investigated were
set by the editors. Here, again, the features cover a great part of the abstract linguistic
system, ranging from phonological analysis, via morphology, grammar, syntax to the
lexicon. This project basically pulls together experts on different pidgin, creole and
mixed languages. Because the features are predefined, and authors are responsible
for specific languages, the cross-compatibility between languages is absolute. That is,
the kind of information that can be found for one language can essentially be found
for every language in the database. The instructions for the authors were to fill out a
detailed questionnaire of features for the language of their expertise. Each language is
also described in a survey chapter, containing a summary of the socio-historical back-
ground, as well as a broad structural outline of the language. This amount of details
provided for each language necessarily reduces the amount of languages that can be
included in the database – experts have to be found that are willing to invest the time
and effort in the project – and the APiCS includes only 76 languages, i.e. a fraction of
the number of languages in WALS.
27.	 Other surveys across pidgin and creole languages have of course been made, but not of the same
scale. A kind of a predecessor to APiCS, containing many features that eventually made it into the
APiCS questionnaire, is the volume edited by Holm & Patrick (2007), which covers various syntactic
features of 18 creole languages.
56	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
The APiCS, however, includes only pidgin, creole and mixed languages, that is,
selected languages that may or may not be of a specific typological sort (see above),
on the assumption that there is something special about these kinds of languages.
Whether they actually are special or not is difficult to ascertain if they are not com-
pared to languages that are not considered special. While many of the APiCS features
actually do overlap partially or even fully with features in WALS, thus allowing for a
comparison between contact languages and ‘non-contact languages’, this is not true
for all features. A complete cross-comparison between APiCS and WALS is therefore
not possible. Furthermore, the sample of the APiCS is biased towards English-lexified
contact languages (27 of 76, or more than a third of the entire sample).
An entirely different database altogether is the Automated Similarity Judgement
Program (ASJP), which aims to provide an objective classification of the world’s lan-
guages by means of lexicostatistical analysis. Lexicostatistics28 is a technique used to
quantitatively compare the rates of change within a set of words in different languages
in order to try to establish in how far they are related and, if they are, when they sepa-
rated from each other. The ASJP computerizes this comparison between sets of words,
using a fixed algorithm. The method is therefore objective and consistent across the
board, and makes the classifications arrived at more objective and consistent than the
existing ones, which are all based on different experts’ knowledge, and, by extension,
their various hypotheses. The task for each contributor in ASJP is to enter a set of 40
lexical items for as many languages as possible. Some macro-data is included for each
language, such as genealogical affiliation, location and number of speakers. Since the
dataset is so small, it is possible for contributors to submit a large amount of languages.
The database thus at the time of writing contains a staggering 5751 languages, dialects
and proto-languages (reconstructed languages assumed to be the nearest equivalents
to ancestor languages that we can arrive at) and the number is constantly increasing.
This is to date one of the largest cross-linguistic databases available.
Since we are dealing with a computerized comparison, the words have to be tran-
scribed in a machine readable format. This is done by approximating the original
transcriptions of the words in the sources according to a set of transcription rules. That
means that the data is a reduced form of the original. It may thus not be of much use
outside the project. And since the transcription is an approximation of the original, it
is not possible to simply convert it back to a more detailed format in order to make it
more accessible to others. We thus have a database with a vast amount of languages,
each only containing a small dataset which is of limited use outside the project.
28.	 Sometimes also called glottochronology. For those who make a distinction between them,
glottoÂ�
chronology is specifically concerned with establishing a date for the split between languages
into daughter languages, while lexicostatistics is “the statistical manipulation of lexical material for
historical inferences (not necessarily associated with dates)” (Campbell 2004:â•›201).

3.4	 A note on methodological issues with sign languages
The issues discussed in this chapter all hold for sign languages too. However, due to the
lack of descriptions and availability of data, cross-linguistic surveys of sign languages
by necessity differ in their approaches to methodological issues for cross-linguistic
surveys of spoken languages.
Just as linguists making cross-linguistic surveys of spoken languages have to rely
on various methods of accessing data, such as through language descriptions, elicita-
tion and questionnaires, as well as texts, so do linguists making cross-linguistic surveys
of sign languages. Because sign language descriptions are still sorely lacking, much of
the information that goes into databases relies on expert knowledge, questionnaires or
other forms of elicitation. To give an example, the data for Zeshan’s (2011a and 2011b)
chapters in WALS rely to a great extent on personal communication with experts.
Because of the lack of data for sign languages, sampling is not really relevant for
cross-linguistic surveys. Rather, as yet any and all available information gets included
in the surveys (Zeshan 2011c). In other words, due to the status of available informa-
tion on sign languages, typological surveys of them are by force convenience samples.
This of course means that all available surveys at this stage are biased; most available
descriptions are of European sign languages.
To document and describe sign languages is therefore a matter of urgent need. The
mechanisms and considerations involved are largely the same as with documenting
and describing spoken languages: fieldwork needs to be conducted, consultants need
to be found, forms and methods for documentation need to be considered, descrip-
tions based on these documentations need to be done (preferably as free of predefined
hypotheses and assumptions as possible). The major difference in procedure between
spoken and signed languages is that signed languages are three-dimensional and
visual/gestural languages, while spoken languages are two-dimensional and audio/
oral languages. For obvious reasons, then, the fieldwork equipment needs to be visually
based (i.e. video cameras) and not audio based. Descriptions of sign languages are best
done in a three-dimensional medium, which is quite straightforward nowadays with
DVDs and the internet readily accessible to a large number of users, although most
currently available descriptions are in written form.
There are a number of endangered sign languages. The current (16th) edition of the
Ethnologue lists Maritime Sign Language (MSL: Canada), Providencia Sign Language
(PSL: Providencia Island), Hawai‘i Pidgin Sign Language (HPSL: Hawaiian Islands)29,
29.	 This is not a ‘pidgin sign language’ in the sense of International Sign, which is a contact language
“that has developed in international settings as a result of contact between deaf users of different sign
languages from Europe and North America” (Zeshan 2011c), but simply a locally based sign language
called (Hawai‘i) Pidgin Sign Language by others.
58	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Benkala Sign Language (also known as Kata Kolok, KK: Indonesia) and Rennellese Sign
Language (RSL: Solomon Islands) as nearly extinct (Lewis 2009), though this clearly
does not cover all known endangered sign languages. Plains-Indian Sign Language
(PISL: USA), for example, is endangered by now (Zeshan 2011c). AdaSL, an indigenous
sign language of Ghana, is rapidly losing native signers, since, due to the schooling
system, signers are shifting to Ghanaian Sign Language (GSL; Nyst 2007). Similarly,
signers of the indigenous Ban Khor Sign Language (BKSL) in Thailand are shifting to
TSL, while other indigenous sign languages of Thailand, such as Old Bangkok Sign
Language (OBSL) and Old Chiangmai Sign Language (OCSL) are near extinction,
sporadically remembered by only a few signers over 50 years of age, but no longer used
in daily conversation (Nonaka 2004:â•›743ff).
	 3.5	 Summary
Any linguistic research depends on language data.Typological surveys often involve a high num-
ber of languages. Data is typically obtained from language descriptions, through native speak-
ers or specialists by way of elicitations or questionnaires, or through texts spoken or written by
native speakers.
Languages are disappearing at an alarming rate, with roughly half of the languages of the
world projected to have gone extinct by the end of this century. Language documentation is an
urgent task. Any kind of language documentation involves fieldwork in some form. Documenta-
tion and description of a language means collecting data and providing an interlinearized gloss-
ing and translation of it. Describing a language means using the documented data to provide
an analysis of the language.
Due to the impossibility of including all languages in a typological survey, samples have to
be made. Probability samples have a set number of values that are mapped across languages.Va-
riety samples seek to capture all possible variables of a feature. Convenience samples are samples
based on access to data. Completely random samples are rarely practical for linguistic surveys
due to the risk of inflationary areal effects.
Samples can be biased in various ways. Bibliographically biased samples are those where
imbalance is due to lack of information. Genealogically biased samples are those where language
families or genera are either over- or underrepresented. Areally biased samples show over- or
underrepresentation of languages from specific linguistic areas. Typologically biased samples
show an over- or underrepresentation of certain linguistic types. Culturally biased samples show
an over- or underrepresentation of various cultures in the sample.
Lack of data for sign languages forces all surveys to be convenience samples. This by neces-
sity makes the surveys biased.There is an urgent need for documentation and description of sign
languages. Documentation and description of sign languages essentially involves the same kinds
	 Chapter 3.â•‡ Methodology	 59
of considerations as with spoken languages, with the exception that the fieldwork equipment
has to be able to capture the gestural/visual nature of sign languages. A number of known sign
languages are endangered at this stage.

Chapter 4
Phonology
Natural languages make use of contrastive elements that combine to form meaningful
units such as words. Spoken languages make systematic use of sounds and arrange-
ments of these sounds to form words and utterances. This chapter gives an overview
of the various sounds found in the world’s languages and how they tend to pattern.
I will first give a sketch of different kinds of phonemes (4.1.1), then bring up how they
combine sequentially to form larger units, syllables, and then move on to mention
the role of prosody (or suprasegments) (4.1.2). Section 4.2 gives an overview of cross-
linguistic patterns, starting with segment inventories and some common as well as less
common phonemes (4.2.1), after which patterns of syllable structures will be brought
up (4.2.2). Section 4.2.3 will mention some patterns of prosody, specifically length, tone
and stress. Section 4.3 gives an overview on sign language phonology.
4.1	 Phonemes, syllables and prosody
The following is meant as a quick overview of the very basics of phonology and is by
no means exhaustive. For very accessible introductions to phonetics and phonology,
see e.g. Ladefoged & Johnson (2010), Ladefoged (2005) and Spencer (1996).
The study of sounds involved in spoken language falls under phonetics and pho-
nology. Very broadly, the former deals with the physical characteristics of speech,
and links linguistics with other disciplines, such as physics (the acoustic dimensions
of speech), anatomy (the physiological aspects of speech production), and psychol-
ogy and neurology (the auditory aspects, primarily of speech perception). The lat-
ter, phonology, deals with the abstract linguistic patterning of the units produced in
speech. Basically, that means that phonology studies how speech sounds are used by
speakers to mark linguistic contrasts, i.e. how sound is used to convey one meaning
and not the other. For instance, in phonetic terms, the initial consonant in pie [phai] is
not exactly the same as the second consonant in spy [spai], but in phonological terms
they are both variants (allophones) of the phoneme /p/. This phoneme then contrasts
with other phonemes, such as /t/ in tie [thai] and sty [stai]. (To be able to distinguish
62	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the two from each other, phonetic transcriptions are given in square brackets while
phonological transcriptions are given between slashes.)30
It should be borne in mind that no two speakers produce exactly the same kinds
of sounds when they speak. Likewise languages that are said to have the same kinds
of phonemes do not produce exactly the same kinds of sounds in phonetic terms. For
example, the five Spanish vowels, /a, e, i, o, u/, are, in absolute terms, not exactly the
same as the five Japanese vowels which are also transcribed /a, e, i, o, u/. However, in
both languages, the way the vowels contrast with each other on a vowel chart is roughly
similar and so the five vowels of each system are viewed as having phonological prop-
erties that are similar enough to warrant transcribing them with the same symbols.
Throughout this chapter it should be kept in mind that we are dealing with contrastive
(phonological) segments and not absolute (phonetic) qualities.
Phonemes are the smallest meaning distinguishing units of a spoken language.
Languages tend to have minimal pairs, where a meaning is changed by swapping only
one single phoneme in the same position, such as pot versus cot. Groups of words like
hat, bat, cat, mat, or bit, but, bat, form minimal sets. A very important point to bear
in mind is that what is contrastive in one language does not necessarily have to be
contrastive in another language. For instance, while [ph] and [p] are not contrastive in
English, as we saw above, but are allophones of the same phoneme /p/, this is not the
case in Hindi (Indo-European (Indic): India), where we find such minimal pairs as
/pɑl/ ‘nature’ versus /phɑl/ ‘knife blade’ (Ohala 1994:â•›35).
Spoken languages make use of consonants and vowels. Vowels are formed when
air passes freely from the lungs through the mouth. Slight movements of the tongue
change the shape of the oral cavity which leads to different vowel qualities. Consonants
are produced by creating obstacles for the air in the vocal tract in various ways. These
obstacles can be created in different places (places of articulation) and in different
ways (manners of articulation).
4.1.1	 	 Segments
The standard way of representing the sounds of spoken languages is with the
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The IPA chart regularly gets revised, adding
symbols for sounds previously not thought to occur in languages (a case in point
being the labiodental flap (see below), which was only added in the 2005 version of the
30.	The superscript h indicates that the consonant is aspirated, i.e. that a short burst of air accom-
panies it. With post-aspirated consonants the burst of air comes immediately after the consonant
has been articulated. Languages may also have pre-aspirated consonants, in which case the burst of
air immediately precedes the articulation of the consonant. Icelandic (Indo-European (Germanic):
Iceland), for example, has preaspirated consonants, such as /sahka/ ‘sinkstone’ or /sahkna/ ‘to regret’
(Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:â•›71).

chart), and taking out symbols as analyses change (for instance the voiceless implo-
sives, which are no longer in the chart).
The current chart is given in Figure 4.1. I will use it as a means for giving the basics
needed in order to understand Section 4.2. As I will be making use of the IPA nota-
tional system, the reader should refer to Figure 4.1 as a guide to the symbols. Bear in
mind that this is a very simplified overview; I will not explain every item listed in the
chart, but merely those necessary to follow the subsequent discussion. For a thorough
overview of the sounds in the world’s languages, see Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996).
The remainder of this chapter relies heavily on the phonological data of the 451 lan-
guages in The UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database (UPSID). I have used
the web interface developed by Henning Reeth (http://web.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/
upsid.html, accessed in March 2010).
4.1.1.1	 Consonants
The obstacles created to produce consonants can vary in degree. Obstruents are
produced by a high degree of constriction of the airflow whereas sonorants allow a
relatively free airflow. If the air is completely closed off, plosives (or stops) are pro-
duced. All languages have plosives. If the two main articulators (the main two parts
of the speech apparatus forming the sound) are placed very close together so that
they obstruct the flow of air without closing it off completely, we get fricatives. While
fricatives are very common, about 8.5% of the languages in Maddieson’s (2011a) sample
lack them, most of them Australian, such as Wardaman (Yangmanic: Australia; Merlan
1994:â•›11). Affricates are essentially consonants that start out as stops and end as frica-
tives. About 66.5% of the languages in UPSID have them. Stops, fricatives and affricates
are obstruents.
Sonorant consonants include nasals and approximants. Nasals are produced
by allowing air to flow out of the nasal passage during the articulation. Nasals are
very common indeed, with only 10 languages in Maddieson’s (2011a) sample, such
as Rotokas, lacking them. Approximants are formed by causing such a low degree
of obstruction to the air that friction is not produced. They are also very common,
present in 96.2% of the languages in the UPSID. Approximants are sometimes divided
into liquids and glides. Liquids are basically “r-sounds” (or rhotics) and “l-sounds”
(laterals). Laterals are formed by closing off a band in the middle section of the mouth
and letting the air flow on one or both sides of the tongue. Rhotics can be either taps
or flaps, which are formed by flicking the tip of the tongue against some point of the
roof of the mouth, or trills, where the tongue is rolled against the place of articulation.
Glides (or semi-vowels) are such sounds as w and j.
If the vocal folds vibrate during the articulation, a voiced consonant is produced, if
they don’t, the consonant is voiceless. All languages in the UPSID contain some kind of

voiced consonant, but four Australian Pama-Nyungan languages (Bandjalang, Dyirbal,
Mbabaram and Yidiny) in UPSID lack voiceless consonants.31
Starting from the front of the mouth and working our way backwards, labial con-
sonants are produced with the lips. There are two types of labials, those involving
both lips, bilabials, and those involving the upper jaw front teeth and the lower lip,
labiodentals. Bilabials are extremely common: a full 563 of 567 (99.3%) languages in
Maddieson’s (2011a) sample have bilabials. Wichita (Caddoan (Caddoan): USA) is an
example of a language that lacks bilabials (Rood 1996; note, however, that bilabials are
only found in 45% of the languages in UPSID).
Consonants produced by raising the front part of the tongue (either the tip or the
blade) towards the roof of the mouth are called coronals. These comprise the biggest
group of consonants. If the tip of the tongue is used, the sound is apical, if the blade
of the tongue is used the sound is laminal. There are languages where this is the only
contrastive feature, such as Yanuyuwa (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia) (see
below). If the underside of the tip of the tongue is used, the sound is retroflex (or
sub-apical). Dentals are produced by raising the tongue to the back of the front teeth.
About a third (35%) of the languages in UPSID have them. Alveolars are produced
by raising the tongue to the hard dome-like structure immediately behind and above
the front teeth, the alveolar ridge. Alveolars are common sounds, found in 63.9% of
the languages of UPSID.32 Post-alveolars are formed by raising the tongue to the back
of the alveolar ridge (but not as far back as the hard palate). These are also common
sounds (found in about two thirds or 64.1% of the languages in UPSID). Yanuyuwa is
an example of a language where an apical post-alveolar contrasts with a laminal post-
alveolar as in /wuḍulu/ ‘in the stomach’ and /wuḏulu/ ‘into the grass’ (Ladefoged &
Maddieson 1996:â•›35). The crucial feature of retroflex consonants is that they are formed
by using the underside of the tip of the tongue to touch an area roughly between the
post-alveolar and palatal section of the mouth. About a fifth (20.2%) of the languages
in UPSID has them and they are especially common in, but not limited to, South Asia.
Consonants produced with the body of the tongue are called dorsals. Palatals
(found in 89.8% of the languages of UPSID) are formed by raising the body of the
31.	 Sonorants may also be voiceless, such as the nasals of Burmese (Sino-Tibetan (Burmese-Lolo):
Myanmar) (cf. for instance the minimal pair /nă/ ‘pain’ versus /n̥ă/ ‘nose’; Bhaskararao & Ladefoged
1991:â•›80). Icelandic nasals occurring before voiceless stops are also voiceless and have been argued
to function as phonemes (see Jessen & Pétursson 1998). Even vowels may be voiceless, which means
they are then in effect whispered, as in Japanese /ki̥ʃi/ ‘shore’ (Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:â•›315).
32.	 It should be noted that a very large number of languages in UPSID (207 or 45.90%) have been
coded dental/alveolar, meaning that it is not specified whether the sound is dental or alveolar. The
figures mentioned above for dentals and alveolars respectively are therefore not entirely representa-
tive for the languages in the database.

(found in 99.6% of the languages in UPSID) are formed. Only two languages in the
database do not have any velars: Dumo (Skou (Western Skou): Papua New Guinea) and
Klao (Niger-Congo (Kru): Liberia; which, however, does have the labio-velars /k⁀b/ and
/g⁀b/). Consonants produced with the soft little piece of flesh dangling at the very back
of the mouth, the uvula, are called uvulars. Less than a fifth (17.5%) of the languages in
Maddieson’s (2011g) database has uvular consonants of some kind.
Radicals are produced with the root of the tongue. Sounds produced with the root
of the tongue moving towards the pharynx and the very back of the mouth are called
pharyngeals. They are quite rare, found in only 21 languages (3.7%) in Maddieson’s
(2011d) sample, mainly in the Middle East and the Caucasus.
The larynx is basically the area around the vocal folds. Laryngeal consonants are
produced with the ‘glottis’ (the space between the vocal folds) and are called glottals.
They are found in 74.5% of the languages in UPSID.
Consonants that do not involve pushing air out of the lungs are called non-
pulmonicÂ�(as opposed to the pulmonic consonants above). There are three kinds of
non-pulmonic consonants, clicks, implosives and ejectives. Clicks and implosives
involve sucking air into the mouth. Clicks are formed by the tongue making both a
front and a back point of contact in the roof of the mouth, with the middle lowered to
form a small pocket of air. When drawing the tongue down and back, the air is sucked
into the mouth and the release makes a small clack (or click) like sound. These are very
rare consonants, found in only 9 (or 1.6%) of the languages in Maddieson’s (2011d)
sample, almost all of them located in southern Africa.33 Implosives are produced by
moving the vocal folds downward which causes the air to move inward for a short
instant. They occur in 11.8% of the languages in UPSID, predominantly in a belt across
Africa south of the Sahara, but also in a cluster on the South East Asian mainland and
in a scattering of languages in both South and North America. Ejectives are formed by
closing off the glottis and raising the larynx at the time of release, pushing out a short
and sharp burst of air from the larynx, which creates a kind of popping sound. These
are also rather rare; 15.3% of the languages in UPSID have some kind of ejective (often
two). They are predominantly found in North America, but there are also a number
of South American languages, as well as Eastern and Southern African and a cluster
of Caucasian languages, that have them.
33.	 Hale (1992:â•›38) reported clicks in Damin, an extinct auxiliary language (i.e. used instead of the
ordinary language of the community, Lardil (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia), by those nov-
ices who were about to be initiated into manhood) in Australia. There are also reports of clicks being
used to ‘spice up’ nursery rhymes in different Chinese dialects. See further Nathan (2001).
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 67
Coarticulated consonants are sounds produced at two places of articulation at the
same time. Those coarticulated consonants that are produced at two different places
at the same time but in the same manner are called doubly articulated, as in Klao,
mentioned above. Examples of this are the labiovelars /k⁀p/ and /g⁀b/. There are 45 (7.9%)
languages in Maddieson’s (2011d) sample with labiovelars, predominantly in West and
Central Africa, but also in Eastern Papua New Guinea.
4.1.1.2	 Vowels
Vowels are defined through three parameters, their height, their backness (or fronted-
ness) and their roundedness.34 Very simplified, high (or close) vowels are produced by
raising the tongue, while low (or open) vowels are produced with the tongue lowered
in the mouth. Front vowels are produced by moving the tongue forward, while back
vowels are produced by retracting the tongue. Round vowels are formed by rounding
the lips. I stress that this is an extremely simplified explanation. In actuality, the pre-
cise properties of the different vowels involve several factors, such as how the air flow
through various spaces in the mouth relate to each other depending on the various
movements and positions of the tongue.
Vowels can be contrastively modified in various ways. For instance with Advanced
Tongue Root (ATR) vowels, the tongue is pushed forward. This is common in West
African languages (Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:â•›300ff). Holding the vocal cords only
loosely together produces a breathy voice vowel, while holding them more tightly
together produces a creaky voice vowel. A rhotic (or rhotacized) vowel is produced
with an “r-colour” modification. Languages may also have pharyngealized, strident
and fricative vowels (see Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:â•›306ff).
Avowelproducedwithoutanychangeinqualityduringthearticulationisamonoph-
thong. If, however, there is a change in quality, it is a diphthong. The vowel in like /laik/
is an example of a diphthong. If there are two changes in quality during the articulation,
it is a triphthong, as in the often heard pronunciation of fire /faɪə/. Languages tend to
have fewer diphthongs than monophthongs (as is the case in English), but cf. Wari’
(Chapacura-Wanhan (Chapacura-Wanhan): Brazil), mentioned below.
Vowels produced by letting air through the nasal passage as well as the oral cav-
ity are called nasalized vowels, as opposed to oral vowels. About a quarter (26.2%) of
the languages in Hajek’s (2011) database has contrastive vowel nasalization. French
is an example of such a language, as can be seen, for instance, in the pair paix /pɛ/
‘peace’ versus pain /pɛ̃/ ‘bread’. Languages usually have a higher number of contrastive
oral vowels than nasal vowels, but Koyra Chiini (Nilo-Saharan (Songhay): Mali), for
34.	 I do not include length, which is a vowel quantity and not quality.
68	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
example, defies this pattern (Hajek 2011). Wari’ is especially interesting, since it has
six oral monophthongs (i.e. none of them nasal), two oral diphthongs, but eight nasal
diphthongs (Everett & Kern 1997:â•›392ff).
4.1.2	 	 Syllables and suprasegmentals
Segments are usually put together to form larger units, syllables, which in turn form
words. Syllables consist of an obligatory nucleus (core), which is almost always a vowel,
though it can be a syllabic consonant (usually a sonorant). Very often there is a coda
consonant after the nucleus. A syllable with a coda is called a closed syllable, while an
open syllable lacks a coda. The nucleus plus coda form the rhyme of the syllable. There
may also be an onset consonant before the nucleus. Hakka (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese):
China) is an example of a language with syllabic consonants, as in /sɹ̩/ ‘teacher’ (I am,
for the moment, ignoring the tones of the language) where /s/ is the onset and /ɹ̩/ the
nucleus (Lee & Zee 2009:â•›107). Languages may also allow several segments to form
either an onset, a nucleus or a coda, for instance a consonant cluster at the beginning
or end of the syllable, or several vowels in the nucleus (Blevins 2004:â•›213). There tends
to be a pattern as to the internal arrangement of consonant clusters, in that the least
sonorous consonants are the furthest away from the nucleus, the so-called sonority
principle. For instance, in the word drink /dɹɪŋk/ the two consonants closest to the
nucleus (/ɪ/) in both the onset and the coda (/ɹ/ and /ŋ/) are more sonorous than the
two consonants at the ends of the syllable (/d/ and /k/).
syllables without sonorants?
InTashlhiyt(Afro-Asiatic(Berber)),alanguagespoken
in Southern Morocco, even obstruents may be used
for a syllable nucleus, as in /tʃ.tft/‘you crushed’and
/tqs.sf/‘it shrunk’.  (Ridouane 2008:â•›332).
Going beyond merely the segmental building blocks of spoken language, speakers
also often use such prosodic (or suprasegmental) features as duration, pitch, loud-
ness, and rhythm. The term suprasegment refers to the fact that these are contrastive
features that may carry over (supra-) across segments. Both consonants and vowels
may have contrastive durations, making them either long or short. In fact, there are
languages that distinguish between three lengths (see 4.2.3.1).
Change in pitch produces various tones, which in many languages are as con-
trastive as segments. It is a paradigmatic feature, distinguishing units from each
other. That means that the units typically substitute each other, in other words, either
unit A is used, or unit B, or unit C – i.e. each form is unique. The tone may either be
a flat pitch at a certain level, a level tone, or a contour tone, where the pitch moves
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 69
from one level to another (either rises or falls) over the Tone Bearing Unit (TBU),
usually the syllable. There are also so-called floating tones, which are tones “associ-
ated with no syllable” (Yip 2002:â•›76), but which carry morphological information.
This is especially common in Bantu languages. An example of a floating tone is the
Bambara (Niger-Congo (Western Mande): Mali) definiteness marker, consisting of
a final low tone only (`). If this is then applied to a word where the final tone is
high, the tone becomes high-low (ˆ), cf. káfé ‘coffee’ but káfê ‘the coffee’ (Schachter
& Shopen 2007:â•›40).
While tone is a paradigmatic feature in the same way as segments are, variation in
loudness, producing stress (or accent)35, is a syntagmatic feature in that the contrast
is the relationship between adjacent units. With lexical stress (or accent) the contrast
is between the syllables of a word. Languages very often distinguish between primary
stress (more prominent) and secondary stress (less prominent), as in ˌphoneˈtician,
where [ˌ] marks the less prominent secondary stress and [ˈ] marks the more prominent
primary stress. For a thorough discussion on the differences between tone, stress and
pitch-accent, see for example Hyman (2006).
Larger prosodic units, Intonation Units (IUs), work on the phrase and the sen-
tence level and usually have the three main functions of “(1) sentence modality
and speaker attitude; (2) phrasing and discourse segmentation; and (3) informa-
tion structure and focus” (Himmelmann & Ladd 2008:â•›250). Intonation will not be
discussed further in this chapter, but rather in the sections discussing the above-
mentioned functions.
4.2	 Phonological typology
It is an absolute universal that all spoken languages have consonants and vowels. It
is also an absolute universal that languages arrange their consonants and vowels into
larger units, syllables, which in turn may be arranged into even larger units, words.
Furthermore, all languages make use of pitch and loudness one way or another. The
following sections give an overview on how languages tend to behave in terms of (seg-
mental) phonemes, syllables and prosody. For an accessible article-length overview of
phonological typology, see Maddieson (2010).
35.	 Strictly speaking, stress is a phonetic parameter while accent is a phonological feature (see, e.g.
Himmelmann & Ladd 2008).
70	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
4.2.1	 	 Segment inventories
The average number of phonemes, i.e. consonants and vowels, for the languages
of the world in Maddieson’s (2011b, 2011h) sample is something like 19–25 conso-
nants and something like five to six vowels36, making the most common phoneme
Â�
inventory between 24 and 31 contrastive segments. It should be noted here that the
vowel inventory in Maddieson (2011h) is restricted to vowel quality only. As we saw
above, languages also contrast vowels in terms of length, nasalization and diphthon-
gization. It could, however, be argued that these are not basic features of a vowel
inventory. A long vowel could be argued to simply be an instance of two short vowels,
and a diphthong to be an instance of vowel-1 plus vowel-2. For instance, Anderson
& Otsuka (2006) consider the Tongan (Austronesian (Oceanic): Tonga) long vowels
and diphthongs as sequences of two syllables. It could also be argued that nasalized
vowels actually consist of a vowel plus a nasal, which is Férère’s (1983:â•›78) analysis of
Haitian Creole (Creole (French-lexified): Haiti) as well as Narang & Becker’s (1971)
analysis of ‘Hindi-Urdu’37. Thus descriptions of individual languages may turn out
to differ considerably. For instance, a language with three vowels, say /a, i, u/, which
are contrastively both long and short, where the short vowels can be nasalized, and
which has six diphthongs, may be said to have as few as three vowels only (/a, i, u/)
or as many as 15 (/a, a:, ã, ai, au, i, i:, ĩ, ia, iu, u, u:, ũ, ua, ui/), or anything in between,
depending on how the author analyses length, nasalization and diphthongation. To
control for this kind of variation in analyses, Maddieson (2011h) only differentiated
vowels according to their quality, i.e. their height, their front-back position, and
their roundedness.
Of the 451 languages in the UPSID, the 25 most common consonants and six most
common vowels, sorted by frequency, are: /m, k, j, p, w, b, h, ɡ, ŋ, ʔ, n, s, ʧ, ʃ, t, f, l, ɲ, d,
ʤ, t̪, kʰ, pʰ, r, v/ and /i, a, u, ɛ, , o, e/.38 English, counting 24 of them, is an example of
36.	 But note that “far more languages have five or seven vowels than have four or six” (Ladefoged
2005:â•›37), i.e. have an odd number of vowels. For a discussion on how Maddieson has determined
which segments to include in his inventories, and which segments to treat as allophones (thus not
including them), see Maddieson (2011b).
37.	 With ‘Hindi-Urdu’ the authors mean “the ‘common core’ language generally spoken by educated
Hindus and Muslims” (Narang & Becker 1971:â•›646) in predominantly the urban areas of roughly
the northern half of the South Asian subcontinent. Both Hindi and Urdu are Indo-European Indic
languages spoken in India and Pakistan respectively.
38.	 I have, in fact, on four occasions merged the so-called dental/alveolars (see footnote 32 above)
with alveolars, i.e. with /n, t, l, s/. In essence, this means that I have listed the 29 most common con-
sonants of the UPSID, with four of them not individually represented.
	 Note that these segments are listed according to how many languages have them, which does not
necessarily correlate with how frequent the individual sound is in a given language. For instance, in
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 71
a language with an average amount of consonants: /p, b, t, d, k, ɡ, f, v, θ, ð, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, ʧ,
ʤ, m, n, ŋ, l, ɹ, w, j, h/. The fact that a language has an average number of consonants
does not automatically mean that those consonants are the most common consonants
among the languages of the world. In fact, we will later see that English contains some
cross-linguistically rare consonants.
Table 4.1 gives an overview of both the most common consonants of the UPSID
and those found in English. The 19 English consonants that overlap with the most com-
mon ones of the UPSID are in a bold outline, while the five English consonants that do
not belong to the most common ones are in italics and slightly shaded.

The smallest phoneme inventories in Maddieson’s (2011b) sample are found in Rotokas
and Pirahã (Mura (Mura): Brazil). Rotokas has only six consonants, /p, t, k, β, ɾ, ɡ/,
making it the language with the smallest known consonant inventory, and five vowels
/i, e, a, o, u/. Pirahã has eight consonants /p, t, k, ʔ, b, ɡ, s, h/ and three vowels /i, o,
a/.39 Rotokas not only exhibits a rare pattern with respect to the small number of its
the UPSID there are 393 languages that have /i/ and 392 languages with /a/, but the latter tends to be
the most frequent vowel in most languages (Ladefoged 2005:â•›176).
39.	 Pirahã also has two very uncommon consonants: the first one is the exceptionally rare “voiced,
lateralized apical-alveolar/sublaminal-labial double flap with egressive lung air. In the formation of
this sound the tongue tip first touches the alveolar ridge and then comes out of the mouth, almost
touching the upper chin as the underblade of the tongue touches the lower lip” (Everett 1982:â•›94). The
second is the cross-linguistically rare, but not unheard of, bilabial trill. Both of these sounds, however,
tend to occur only in “special types of speech performance” (Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:â•›19) and
are therefore not included in the general consonant inventory.
72	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
consonantal system, but also in the fact that there is no nasal. The fact that a language
has a small number of consonants does not automatically mean that its inventory
will consist of the cross-linguistically most common ones: two of the consonants in
Rotokas, i.e. a third of the inventory, /β/ and /ɾ/, are uncommon, found respectively in
54 (12%) and 7 (1.6%) of the UPSID languages.
While there is general agreement that !Xóõ (Khoisan (Southern Khoisan):
Botswana) has the largest phoneme inventory known, the number given differs consid-
erably. In the UPSID !Xóõ is listed as having 141 contrastive segments, 95 consonants
and 46 vowels. However, using the criteria of Maddieson (2011h) mentioned above,
!Xóõ only has five vowels. On the other hand Maddieson (2011b citing Traill 1985 and
1994) states that !Xóõ has 122 consonants. This would bring the total down to 126 pho-
nemes, which is still a sizeable inventory.
Pirahã is a case in point that a small consonant inventory does not automatically
mean a large vowel inventory. In fact, Maddieson states that “absolutely no correlation
was found between the number of vowels and the number of consonants” (2011h). He
has four languages (0.7%) in his sample with only two vowel quality contrasts: Abkhaz
(Northwest Caucasian (Northwest Caucasian): Georgia), Margi (Afro-Asiatic (Biu-
Mandara): Nigeria), Mparntwe Arrernte (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia) and
Yimas (Lower Sepik-Ramu (Lower Sepik): Papua New Guinea). Mparntwe Arrernte,
for instance, has /Çš, a/ (Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:â•›286). Notice that even with this
small inventory, Mparntwe Arrernte makes use of vowel height as a contrastive feature.
This is, in fact, another absolute universal (Hyman 2008). As Ladefoged & Maddieson
put it, “[a]ll languages have some variations in vowel quality that indicate contrasts in
the vowel height dimension. Even if a language has only two phonologically contras-
tive vowels, the differences will always be in this dimension rather than the front-back
dimension” (1996:â•›286).
Table 4.2 below gives some examples of how different vowel systems may typically
look. In each of the systems, the vowels that overlap with the six most common ones
of the UPSID listed above have been marked in bold.
What is primarily typical about the systems in Table 4.2 is first of all that height
is a contrastive feature in each of them, even in the very small inventories. Secondly,
vowel systems tend to be peripherally symmetrical, or, if asymmetrical, as in the case
of Quapaw (Siouan (Siouan): USA), they tend to have more front than back vowels
(Schwartz et al. 1997). The term ‘peripherally symmetrical’ is adoped from Schwartz
et al. (1997) and means that the vowels located at the outer borders of the IPA chart,
such as /i, e, ɛ, a, ɔ, o, u/, tend to occur in the same heights both at the front and
the back. It should be noted that /a/ is often part of a vowel inventory, making the
typical vowel system roughly triangular. In other words, languages tend “to prefer
an odd number of peripheral vowels (hence, one ‘low’ and an equal number of front
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 73
and back ones) whatever the overall number of vowels in a system” (Schwartz et al.
1997:â•›243). Thus, a system with an even number of vowels, such as Fyem (Niger-
Congo (Platoid): Nigeria) with six vowels, will typically have the same five vowels
as a 5-vowel system, with the addition of a central vowel, more commonly /Çš/ (a
pattern found in 24, or 40%, of the 60 languages investigated by Schwartz et al.
(1997)40. The exception to this pattern, however, is the 4-vowel system, which tends
to be asymmetrical. Of the UPSID languages investigated in Schwartz et al. (1997)
with a 4-vowel system (25 in total), all were asymmetrical, with the majority (14 or
56%) having more front than back vowels.
40.	But cf. Spencer (1996:â•›120) stating that 6-vowel systems of the type /i, e, a, o, u, ɨ/ are more com-
mon than the type /i, e, a, o, u, Çš/.

The languages with the most vowels in Maddieson’s (2011h) database are German,
with 15, and (British) English and Bété (Niger-Congo (Kru): Ivory Coast), each of
which has 13. Table 4.3 gives an overview of both the most common vowels of the
UPSID and those found in German. The six German vowels that overlap with the
most common ones of the UPSID are in a bold outline, while the four German vowels

We have seen which the most common consonants and vowels are. While it seems
intuitively straightforward that a large inventory will include uncommon phonemes,
we have already seen in Rotokas that a small inventory does not necessarily include
only common phonemes. It is also important to keep in mind that simply because we
are used to certain phonemes, because they occur in well-known languages, it does
not follow that these are common cross-linguistically. A case in point are the dental
non-sibilant fricatives of English /θ, ð/, which occur in only 40 of 567 languages, i.e.
7.1%, in Maddieson’s (2011d) database. Other rare consonants include clicks, found in 9
(1.6%) of the languages in Maddieson’s (2011d) sample and only in Africa. All Khoisan
languages have them, but they are also found in other southern and eastern African
languages, albeit with a much lower frequency and with a much smaller proportion
of words containing clicks, such as Zulu (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): South Africa) and
Dahalo (Afro-Asiatic (Southern Cushitic): Kenya) (Ladefoged & Maddieson 1996:
246). The fact that clicks occur as far north as Hadza (Isolate) and Sandawe (Khoisan
(Sandawe)) in Tanzania, as well as Dahalo in Kenya, is one of the reasons for the
assumption that languages with clicks were once more widespread. The circle on
Map 4.1 indicates the area where most click languages are found, while the three tri-
angles mark Hadza, Sandawe and Dahalo.
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 75
A consonant that was until relatively recently thought non-existent (cf. Dryer 1997:
124) is the bilabial trill /b/, i.e. a trill (see above) formed with both lips, which is found
as an ordinary phoneme in a handful of languages in Africa (predominantly West
Africa) as well as a number of Austronesian languages (Maddieson 1989), as shown
on Map 4.1. Languages that have bilabial trills as allophones (for example Pirahã, as
mentioned above), or only in a limited set of the lexicon, have not been indicated on
the map.

An extremely rare consonant among the languages of the world is the interdental
approximant, found in, for example, the Californian dialect of American English.
Here the approximant for the word this, pronounced /ðis/ in most English varieties, is
formed by letting the tongue protrude between the teeth in such a way that the tongue
blade moves towards the upper teeth without closing off the air passage /ð̞/. In some
languages, such as Bauchi Guda (Niger-Congo (Kainji): Nigeria), the interdental is
76	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
phonemic. In fact, Bauchi Guda has at least three contrastive interdental approximants:
/ð̞/, /ð̞w/ and /ð̞j/ (Harley & Blench fc: 10).
Because many of us are familiar with European languages such as French and
German, we might not be aware of the fact that the high and mid front rounded
vowels /y, ʏ, ø, œ/ common in those languages are in fact cross-linguistically rare.41
Only 6.6% in Maddieson’s (2011c) sample have them. Most of those languages
can be found in northern Eurasia, though there is one in Africa, Ejagham (Niger-
Congo (Bantoid): Nigeria), three in the Pacific region, Malakmalak (Australian
(Northern Daly): Australia), Iaai (Austronesian (Oceanic): New Caledonia) and
Natügu (Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands), and four on the American
continent, Hopi (Uto-Aztecan (Hopi): USA), Quiotepe Chinantec (Oto-Manguean
(Chinantecan): Mexico), Wari’ and Aikaná (Isolate: Brazil)42. In general, those lan-
guages that have front rounded vowels tend to have a larger than average vowel
inventory (Maddieson 2011c).
Another example of a vowel we are rather used to, but which is cross-linguistically
very rare, is the rhotacized, lower-mid central unrounded vowel /ɝ/, which is very
common in American English (for example in the word bird) and can also be found,
though less frequently, in Mandarin (Ladefoged 2005:â•›29). A similar vowel, /ɚ/, can be
found in Changzhou Wu (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese): China) (Chao 1970:â•›48) as well as
in Yurok (Algic (Yurok): USA) (Blevins 2003).
There are so many known phonemes that are extremely rare, occurring in very few
or even only one language, such as the Swedish /ɧ/ (usually described as a simultane-
ous ʃ and x)43, that it would be impossible to list them all. In fact, about 46% of all the
segments in the UPSID occur only in one single language. According to Ladefoged
(2005:â•›xiii) there are about 200 different vowels and more than 600 different conso-
nants in the world’s languages.
41.	 Swedish actually has two high front rounded vowels, /y/ and what I will denote as /ʉ̟/ (follow-
ing Engstrand 1990:â•›43), by which I mean that the sound is a front and not a central vowel. The two
vowels differ in that /y/ has what Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996:â•›296) term “(horizontal) lip rounding
and protrusion” (‘outrounded’ in Engstrand 1990:â•›43) while the latter has “(vertical) lip compression”
(‘inrounded’ in Engstrand 1990:â•›43). Swedish thus has a minimal set, ni /ni:/ ‘you (pl)’, ny /ny:/ ‘new’
and nu /nʉ̟:/ ‘now’, where the only contrastive feature is the (type of) lip rounding.
42.	This classification follows Anonby (2009) and Fabre (2009), among others, and differs from the
WALS classification which lists Aikaná as an Arawakan language.
43.	 The symbol /ɧ/ actually covers several, slightly different sounds in Swedish (Elert 1989:â•›76f,
for example, differentiates between three). However, the variation is regional and allophonic, not
phonemic.
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 77
back unrounded vowels
Back unrounded vowels, /ɯ, ɤ, ʌ, ɑ/, are also rather uncommon; Maddieson states that“front
rounded vowels are more frequently found than back unrounded” (1984:â•›125). However, a
query in the UPSID for front rounded monophthongs yields 32 (7.1% of 451) languages, while
a query for back unrounded monophthongs yields 85 (18.9%) languages with at least one
back unrounded vowel.This discrepancy could possibly be due to the fact that the UPSID only
contained 317 languages in 1984, while it now contains 451. Of these, 47 languages have /ɯ/,
a sound often thought of as ‘exotic’because it rarely occurs in Europe – though Scots Gaelic
(Indo-European (Celtic): UK), which is not in the UPSID, has it (Ladefoged et al. 1998), as does
Turkish. (Actually, Scots Gaelic has both /ɯ/ and /ɤ/, which places it in the group of languages
that has the more common type of 2-way contrast.) Again, because we are so familiar with
English, we might not be aware of the fact that the sound /ʌ/, as in the word luck, is in fact quite
rare. It is found in only 10 (2.4%) of the languages of the UPSID. Figure 4.2 gives a summary of
the back unrounded vowels in the UPSID plus English.

Figure 4.2â•‡ Proportions of back unrounded vowels in UPSID with English added.
21 languages, including English, have either two (15) or three (6) back unrounded vowels. Eng-
lish, with /ʌ, ɑ/, and Nishi (Sino-Tibetan (Tani): India), with /ɯ, ʌ, ɑ/, are the only languages that
contrast the two low ones. The most frequent 2-way contrast is /ɯ, ɤ/, found in eight UPSID
languages. (But note that Irish (Indo-European (Celtic): Ireland) is listed in the UPSID as having
only one back unrounded vowel, /ɑ/. Ní Chasaide (1999), however, lists /ɯ/ and /ɤ/ as part of
the Irish vowel inventory.) Vietnamese (Austro-Asiatic (Viet-Muong): Vietnam) is an example
of a language with a 3-way contrast, /ɯ, ɤ, ʌ/.
4.2.2	 	 Patterns of syllable structures
Almost all languages allow syllables of CV, where the onset C stands for any conso-
nant and the nucleus V for any vowel (of any length, monophthong or diphthong).
A very rare exception to this near-absolute universal can be found in four dialects of
Kunjen (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia), namely Oykangand, Olgol, Okunjan
and Kawarrangg (Sommer 1970). Most languages allow syllables consisting only of a
78	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
vowel (V), or consisting of two consonants and a vowel (CCV or CVC). Languages
that allow anything up to the latter two types are labelled as having moderately com-
plex syllables in Maddieson (2011e), and make up more than half (56.4%) of his data-
base. Most often the second consonant in the CCV syllables can only be a liquid or a
glide. For instance, the only consonant clusters allowed in Chamorro (Austronesian
(Chamorro): Guam) are Cl, Cr and Cw (Topping 1973:â•›36f);44 consequently a word like
dop.bla ‘bend’ (the dot . indicates a syllable break) contains the two most complex types
of syllables allowed in the language.
Some languages, however, only allow simple (C)V syllables, where (C) means that
the onset is optional. An example of this would be Yoruba (Niger-Congo (Defoid):
Nigeria), where a.wo ‘cult’ illustrates the only types of syllables allowed (Bamgbose
1966:â•›6,â•›9). There are also languages that do not permit syllables consisting only of a
nucleus, such as Mantjiltjara (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia), which has only
two types of syllables, CV and CVC (Marsh 1969:â•›145), as in ju: ‘yes’, ma.ji ‘food’, wil.tu
‘hard’ and ŋa.kum.pa ‘deaf’.45 And while it is rare, there is at least one known language,
Hua (Trans-New Guinea (Eastern Highlands): Papua New Guinea), where the only
type of syllable allowed is CV (Haiman 1980a).46 Languages that only allow the simple
syllables (C)V make up 12.5% of Maddieson’s database.
The middle group of languages is that allowing complex syllables, i.e. syllables with
more than three consonants plus a vowel. This is found in 31.1% languages of the sam-
ple. English is an example of a language with complex syllables, allowing a consonant
cluster of up to three in the onset and up to four in the coda, CCCVCCCC, although
this kind of syllable is rather infrequent in the language (the example typically given
is strengths if pronounced [strɛŋkθs]). However, words with either three consonants in
the onset or four in the coda are not infrequent, such as scrubs [skrʌbz] and glimpsed
[glɪmpst]. These words are also examples of the sonority principle mentioned above.
Georgian (Kartvelian (Kartvelian): Georgia) is an example of a language that allows
very complex syllables indeed, with up to six consonants in a cluster: mc’vrtneli47
‘trainer’ (Butskhrikidze 2002:â•›106). Languages that allow complex syllables also tend
to allow simple syllables.
Maddieson (2011e) found a certain correlation between syllable structure and
consonant inventories: languages with simple syllable structures tend to have smaller
44.	The first two types of clusters, Cl and Cr, only occur in words borrowed from Spanish or English.
For more on borrowing and language contact, see 13.2.
45.	 It’s slightly more complicated than that, though, as the language allows CCV and C suffixes.
46.	This in fact only represents the underlying structure of the syllables; other structures may occur,
under specific conditions. See further Haiman (1980a).
47.	 c’ is one single consonant and stands for a glottalized, or ejective, alveolar affricate [ʦ’].
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 79
consonant inventories, and, conversely, languages with complex syllable structures
tend to have larger consonant inventories. However, he goes on to say that “these
overlaps might be due to fortuitous distribution of genealogically-shared or areally-
spread features” (ibid.).
4.2.3	 	 Patterns of prosody
4.2.3.1	 Length
All spoken languages have short vowels and consonants. It is also not uncommon for
languages to have long vowels, though the UPSID only lists 51 languages, or 11.3% of
the database, containing them. It should be noted here that that figure covers languages
which have any kind of long vowels, irrespective of whether they contrast with short
vowels of the same quality. For instance, English has a number of long vowels, but
none of them contrast with a short vowel of the same quality. Thus /i:/ is basically the
long counterpart of /ɪ/ in the pair heal/hill, /u:/ is the long counterpart of /ʊ/ in the
pair fool/full, and so on. An example of a language where length is truly a contrastive
feature, i.e. where the same vowel quality can occur either as a short or a long vowel,
is Croatian, as shown in (17) (I am, for the moment, ignoring the pitch accent distinc-
tions of the language).
		 Croatian (Indo-European (Slavic): Croatia)
	 (17)		 short	 gloss	 long	 gloss
		 /i/	 ʋile	 ‘hayfork’	 ʋi:le	 ‘fairies’
		 /e/	 tek	 ‘only’	 te:k	 ‘appetite’
		 /a/	 pas	 ‘dog’	 pa:s	 ‘belt’
		 /o/	 kod	 ‘by, at’	 ko:d	 ‘code’
		 /u/	 duɡa	 ‘stave’	 du:ɡa	 ‘rainbow’	 (Landau et al. 1995:â•›84)
Languages can even have three length distinctions for vowels. The UPSID lists 9 (2%)
languages with so-called reduced (or extra-short) vowels. Khanty (Uralic (Ugric):
Russia), for instance, has contrastive full, long and reduced vowels, as in köt /køt/
‘hand’ contrasting with reduced vowel in kö ̆t /kø̆t/ ‘distance’ (Gulya 1966:â•›24). Lanyjang
Dinka (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Sudan), on the other hand, is an example of a language
with short, long and overlong vowels, as in /láŋ/ ‘kind of berry’ (pl) contrasting with
/làaŋ/ ‘kind of berry’ (sg) and /lăaaŋ/ ‘slave’ (sg) (ignoring, for the moment, the dif-
ferences in tone; Remijsen & Adong Manyang 2009).
Languages may also have long consonants, and the UPSID lists 12 (2.7%) such
languages. An example of a language with contrastive consonant length is Central
Berawan (Austronesian (Northwest Malayo-Polynesian): Malaysia) (specifically the
Long Teru dialect), with pairs such as /liŋŋen/ ‘self’ versus /liŋen/ ‘out of sight’ (Blust
1995:â•›128). Some languages have three consonant lengths, such as Inari Saami (Uralic
80	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
(Finnic): Finland) with short, half-long and long consonants, though the latter two
are usually not distinguished in orthography anymore. Compare, for instance, vari-
ous grammatical cases of the word pínnoo ‘stack, pile’: nom pínnoo /pínˑo:/ (half-long
n), gen/acc pínoo /píno:/ (short n), ess48 pínnòon /pín:ò:n/ (long n) (Bye 2007:â•›62).49
4.2.3.2	 Tone
Tone is a very common feature in the languages of the world, especially in Africa
and Southeast Asia. However, in Maddieson’s (2011f) sample the non-tonal languages
dominate.
This probably underrepresents the proportion of the world’s languages which are tonal
since the sample is not proportional to the density of languages in different areas. For
example, (…) less than 5% of the Niger-Congo languages are included. (…) <But> over
10% of the Western European languages listed are included, only two of which are tonal
or marginally so and the rest non-tonal. If, correspondingly, 10% of the Niger-Congo
family had been included, 80 additional tone languages would have been included.
 (Maddieson 2011f)
The tonal languages in Maddieson’s sample were coded for whether they had simple
tone, contrasting only two tones (usually high and low), or whether they had a more
complex tone inventory. Simple tone languages, making up a quarter of the total data-
base, are more frequent than complex tone languages (with 16.7%). There are almost no
tonal languages in Europe, though Norwegian (Indo-European (Germanic): Norway),
Swedish, Latvian (Indo-European (Baltic): Latvia; (Brenzinger 1973)) and Goizueta
Basque (Isolate: Spain; Hualde et al. 2008) are exceptions, all with simple tone sys-
tems.50 Languages in South Asia, the islands of Southeast Asia (such as Indonesia and
the Philippines) and Australia tend not to have tones. While there are tonal languages
on the American continent, the majority seem to be non-tonal. Tone languages are
very common in Africa and continental Southeast Asia, with complex systems domi-
nating in the latter area. Tilquiapan Zapotec (Oto-Manguean (Zapotecan): Mexico) is
an example of a language with a simple tone system, having only two contrastive tones,
48.	essive case can be roughly translated into ‘as something’, in this example the essive would trans-
late into something like ‘as a pile’ or ‘as a stack’.
49.	Long consonants, sometimes also called over-long (as opposed to the long, which are here
labelled half-long), were previously distinguished orthographically from half-long consonants by an
apostrophe, which in this case would mean a spelling like pínoo – pínnoo – pín’noon (Trosterud &
Uibo 2005:â•›142).
50.	 Goizueta Basque not only has two contrastive tones, but also two contrastive types of stress,
effectively giving a 4-way contrast.
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 81
high and low, as in biaxtily /biaʃtíli/ ‘soap’ versus biaxtily /biaʃtìli/ ‘white prickly pear’
(Merrill 2008:â•›111). An example of a language with a complex tone system is Eastern
Kayah Li, contrasting three level plus two contour tones, as in Table 4.4.

There are no known languages with more than five level tones (Blevins 2001b). Gimira
is an example of a language that has five level tones plus one contour tone, giving a
minimal set of up to six contrasts, as in Table 4.5:

Ticuna (Isolate: Brazil) is another example of a language with a very complex tone
system, with five level tones, as well as four contour tones (Anderson 1962; cf. also
Soares 1992).
Interestingly, the languages in APiCS exhibit a slightly different pattern (Michaelis
et al. 2013: feature 120). The majority are non-tonal, which is parallel to the languages
in Maddieson’s WALS database, but the ratio of non-tonal languages is higher among
51.	 Tone numbers are used to indicate the movement of the tone during the utterance of the TBU.
Level tones start and end at the same place, for instance at the mid level (3), and is therefore coded
as 33 (which means that the tone moves from level 3 to level 3). Contour tones move and the number
indicates the direction by coding the start and end points. Thus a 21 tone means that the tone started
at level 2 and fell to level 1.
82	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the languages in APiCS (52 of 7452 languages or 70.3% in APiCS to the 307/526 or 58.4%
in WALS after the pidgins and creoles have been subtracted from Maddieson’s sam-
ple). The proportion of APiCS languages with a simple tone system (21 languages or
28.4%) is slightly higher than the proportion of non-creoles with simple tone system.
However, only one (1.4%) APiCS language, Sango (Creole (Ngbandi-lexified): Central
African Republic)53 has a complex tone system, which is of a much lower proportion
than the 16.7% of the WALS languages. Harking back to the fact that the tone languages
were probably underrepresented in WALS and that the APiCS languages had a higher
proportion of non-tonal languages, this seems to imply that (i) pidgin and creole lan-
guages are less likely to be tonal, and (ii) if they are, it is less likely that pidgin and
creole languages will have a complex tone system than a non-creole language.
Maddieson found that “tonal complexity and complexity of segment inventory
tend to go hand in hand across the set of languages surveyed” (2011f). In his sample,
the languages with complex tone systems also tended to have larger inventories of
both consonants and vowels. The correlation was inverse for syllable structures, in that
languages with complex tone systems tended to have less complex syllable structures,
while languages with complex syllable structures tended to not be tonal. Put differently,
the more complex the syllable, the less likely that it will be a tonal language.
4.2.3.3	 Stress
A little over half (56.2% to be precise) of the 502 languages surveyed by Goedemans &
van der Hulst (2011a) have fixed stress. Very simplified, languages with fixed stress can
be divided into two major groups: those where primary stress is placed relative to the
left end of the word and those where primary stress is placed relative to the right end
of the word. I will here arbitrarily assign the first group the label LS (for Left Stress)
and the second RS (for Right Stress) for the sake of being able to have an easy shortcut
to distinguish the two in the present section. However, it should be kept in mind that
these labels are not used in studies dealing with stress and rhythm. Note also that I will
not discuss patterns of secondary stress.
The majority of the languages with fixed stress in Goedemans & van der Hulst’s
sample are RS languages (61.3%) though LS languages are also common (38.7%) and
both groups are spread over the world although there seems to be a slight tendency
52.	 Since Singlish is marked as having a complex tone system of only marginal frequency (Ansaldo
& Lim 2013), I have included it in the group of languages marked as non-tonal. Information is not
available for Batavia Creole (Creole (Portuguese-lexified): Indonesia) and Early Sranan, which is
why the figure of total languages is 74 for tone, despite the fact that the total number of languages in
APiCS is 76.
53.	 Note that this classification follows that of APiCS and not that of WALS, where Sango is classified
as a Niger-Congo Ubangi language.
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 83
for LS in European and Australian languages and a tendency for RS in Austronesian
languages. For each group, stress can be located at one of three positions relative to
the end of the word: either the syllable at the end, or one syllable in from the end, or
two syllables in from the end. For LS that means that stress is either located on the
first syllable (‘initial stress’), the second syllable (‘second stress’) or the third syllable
(‘third stress’) of the word. Initial stress is by far the most common strategy, with 92
(84.4%) languages. An example of a language with initial stress is Kayardild (Australian
(Tangkic): Australia), as in ˈmalaa ‘sea’ (Evans 1995:â•›81).
A minority of the LS languages have the stress on the second syllable, such as
Dakota (Siouan (Siouan): USA) waˈkte ‘I kill’ (Shaw 1985:â•›175). Only one single LS
language in the database, Winnebago (Siouan (Siouan): USA), regularly places stress
on the third syllable from the left, as in hopiˈrak ‘belt’ haraˈčabra ‘the taste’ (Miner
1979:â•›28).
The three types of stress mapped for RS languages are the last syllable (‘ultimate
stress’), the second to the last syllable (‘penultimate stress’) and the third to the last syl-
lable (‘antepenultimate stress’) of the word. The majority (63.6%) of the RS languages
place their stress on the penultimate, such as Rapanui (Austronesian (Oceanic): Easter
Island), for example maˈneŋe ‘small’ (Du Feu 1996:â•›193). The second largest group
(29.5%) of the RS languages place their stress on the ultimate. An example of a lan-
guage with consistent ultimate stress is Bashkir (Altaic (Turkic): Russia), as in /kitˈap/
‘book’ and /kitapˈlar/ books (Poppe 1964:â•›18). Antepenultimate languages comprise the
smallest group (6.9%). Georgian, for instance, has an antepenultimate stress pattern,
as in dedali /ˈdɛdalɪ/ ‘hen’ (Butskhrikidze 2002:â•›97).
220 languages (or 43.8%) in the sample do not have fixed stress, but allow stress
to occur on different syllables. English is an example of such a language, as in the pair
ˈpermit (noun) and perˈmit (verb) or in the set ˈdemocrat, deˈmocracy, demoˈcratic. In
many languages, English among them, even if stress isn’t fixed, the location of the
stressed syllable is still consistently either towards the left or the right of the word
boundary. It is far more common in Goedemans & van der Hulst’s (2011b) sample
that the stress occurs somewhere on the right (41.8%), such as in English, but in a fair
amount of languages (17.7%) stress is placed somewhere to the left. An example of such
a language is Malayalam (Dravidian (Southern Dravidian): India), as in /ˈpukavaɳʈi/
‘train’ (primary stress is on the first syllable) and /paʈˈʈa:ɭakˌa:ram/ ‘soldier’ (primary
stress is on the second syllable) (Asher & Kumari 1997:â•›436). There are no left-oriented
systems in Africa and very few on the Eurasian landmass in Goedemans & van der
Hulst’s sample. About a quarter of the languages without fixed stress (24.6%) have
so-called unbounded systems, meaning that stress can be anywhere. This kind of sys-
tem is spread all over the world, although it is rare in the Asian part of the Eurasian
landmass. An example of a language with an unbounded system is Seri (Hokan (Seri):
84	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Mexico) (Marlett 2008). A few languages (only 8 or 3.6% in the sample) combine
this type of unbounded system with a right-oriented system. Danish (Indo-European
(Germanic): Denmark) is an example of such a language (Grønnum 1998). Finally,
there are languages (10.9%) where the stress location is not predictable, for instance
Rama (Chibchan (Rama): Nicaragua) (Grinevald n.y.).
In most of the languages with predictable non-fixed stress, the determining factor
of where the stress occurs has to do with syllable weight. A syllable can be made heavy
either because it has a long vowel, or because it has a coda, or both. In some languages
the position of stress is lexically contrastive. For instance, the only difference between
the two Greek words /ˈjɛros/ ‘old man’ and /jɛˈros/ ‘strong’ (Hionides 2002) or the two
Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italy) words /ˈcantɔ/ ‘I sing’ and /canˈtɔ / ‘I sang’
(source: personal knowledge) is whether the stress is on the first or second syllable.
4.3	 Sign language phonology
We have seen that spoken languages have a limited set of linguistically contrastive
segments, that is, units that are in themselves meaningless, but that can be combined
into larger units, syllables, which in turn either in themselves serve as words or can
combine into words. This is also the case with signed languages. And while the termi-
nology is borrowed from the study of spoken languages, the fact that sign languages
have phonemes and syllables should hardly be a difficult concept. William Stokoe
(1960), in his greatly influential analysis of ASL, showed that the phonemes of signed
languages are, just as in spoken languages, a limited set of contrastive segments that are
built up from a set of distinctive features. These contrastive segments, phonemes, are
then combined into larger units, signs. By changing one of the segments, the meaning
of the sign is changed – forming minimal pairs or sets.
Signs are formed either with one hand or both, but there is usually one dominant
hand, with the other hand serving a subordinate, but significant role, mainly in the
domain of prosody and grammar. There is no known sign language where the choice
of hand is significant (Emmorey 2002). In other words, signers use the hand they are
most comfortable with as the dominant hand.
Stokoe (1960) distinguished between three parameters for a segment: handshape,
location and movement.54 Handshape denotes the shape of the hand during the sign,
for instance if the hand is formed as a fist, if the fingers are spread or together, if
54.	 Stokoe coined the terms chereme and cherology (from Greek cheir ‘hand’) for the minimal
meaning distinguishing units of sign languages, as a parallel to phoneme and phonology in oral
languages. However, the terms have by now largely been abandoned in favour of ‘phoneme’ and
‘phonology’.
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 85
they are bent, and so on. The location refers to where the hand is on the body of the
signer, or around the space of the signer. For instance, the hand can be around the
head, the mouth or the chest; it can be directly in front of the signer or to the side,
and so on. Finally, movement denotes how the hand moves during the sign, that is,
whether it moves away from or towards the signer, up or down, left or right, and so
on. Subsequent research has added hand orientation and non-manual features to
the inventory. Hand orientation denotes the way the palm faces during the sign. This
feature can, together with the feature handshape, also be considered a subfeature of
the hand configuration (cf. for example Sandler & Lillo-Martin 2006). Non-manuals
include, for example, facial expressions and body posture. Thus sign languages also
have minimal pairs, such as in DGS, where the difference between ‘ask’ and ‘answer’
lies only in the handshape, as shown in Figure 4.2.
In Figure 4.2a and b the location and movement of the sign are the same, but the
handshapes differ, with the index and thumb meeting to form a ring and the three
remaining fingers outstretched in the sign for ASK, but with the index and middle
fingers outstretched and the rest bunched up in a fist for the sign for ANSWER.
While almost everybody agrees that sign languages also arrange their contrastive
segments sequentially to form syllables, the analyses of the exact nature of a syllable
differ. Liddell (1984) proposes that syllables consist of two kinds of segments, hold
(the period of time when none of the components of the sign change) and movement
(the period of time when any of the components of the sign may change), analogous
to consonants and vowels of spoken languages. Another model (see, for example,
Corina & Sandler 1993) proposes that it is location, rather than hold, which combines
with movement to form syllabic sequences. Yet other models include, for example,
Perlmutter (1992), where movement combines with position, and van der Hulst (1993),
who effectively considers movement as only a transition between locations. In many
sign languages the majority of the signs are monosyllabic.

86	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
The dynamics of the feature movement allows it to be likened to a kind of visual
sonority (Sandler 2003) and there are several proposals for a sign language sonority
scale analogous to the spoken language sonority scale, among others Sandler (1993)
and Brentari (1993).
Sign languages also make use of suprasegments, that is, contrastive units that
may carry over across segments, such as tone in spoken languages. These are pre-
dominantly non-manuals, but hand configurations can also be considered to belong
to this category, since handshape and orientation can be consistent throughout an
L-M-L (Â�
location-movement-location) sign. Non-manuals may carry such prosodic
information as intonation and intonation units, for instance expressing content (wh-)
questions or shared information (Pfau & Quer 2010). For example, ISL forms polar
questions with the non-manual signs of raised brows, widened eyes and the head tilted
forwards during the sign (Nespor & Sandler 1999:â•›171).
Phonological inventories of sign languages differ. ASL, for instance, has 25 hand-
shapes (Tennant & Brown 1998:â•›28), while the NGT has 31 (van der Kooij 2002:â•›154ff),
AdaSL has 29 (Nyst 2007:â•›70) and Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL) in Israel
has 15 (Israel & Sandler 2011). As yet there are no cross-linguistic macro-surveys of
the phonological systems of sign languages, although research on individual sign lan-
guages is vibrant and growing. Such questions as how many handshapes may be com-
mon to all or most of the known and described sign languages are therefore a matter
for future research.
	 4.4	 Summary
Both spoken and signed languages systematically make use of a set inventory of linguistically
contrastive segments to build larger units of syllables and words.
In spoken languages these segments can be divided into consonants and vowels.Vowels are
formed by letting air flow freely through the oral cavity, modified by the height and position of
the tongue. Nasal vowels allow air to also flow through the nasal cavity. Consonants are formed
by creating various kinds of obstacles for the air flow, partially or completely. Some consonants
are formed by sucking air in instead of letting it flow out.
Suprasegmental features such as length (the duration of the production of the segment),
tone (modifications in pitch) and stress (modifications in volume of the unit) may also be con-
trastive.
Languages differ radically in terms of their segment inventories, ranging from 11 to 126 pho-
nemes. The average phoneme inventory has 19–25 consonants and 5–6 vowels. Almost all lan-
guages allow their phonemes to combine to (C)V syllables, with optional onsets. Many languages
are tonal, most commonly distinguishing between two tones (usually high and low). It is slightly
	 Chapter 4.â•‡ Phonology	 87
more common to have fixed stress, usually on the penultimate. Languages that do not have fixed
stress tend to place stress on one of the syllables towards the right end of the word.
In signed languages the contrastive segments are either hold and movement or location
and movement. These are arranged sequentially to form syllables. Non-manuals also tend to be
contrastive, functioning on a suprasegmental and prosodic level. Choice of hand is not contras-
tive. Further research may reveal cross-linguistic patterns on inventories and structures of the
phonology of sign languages.

Morphology
We have seen that languages make use of contrastive segments, the smallest units that
differentiate between meanings. These small elements do not in themselves convey any
meaning, they merely serve contrastively. Both spoken and signed languages make use
of another type of minimal element, namely those that do convey some kind of mean-
ing: morphemes. This chapter gives an overview of what kinds of morphemes languages
may have and how they may combine. I will first give a brief sketch of the very basics of
morphological concepts (5.1). In Section 5.2 I give an overview of how languages tend
to employ morphemes. I first discuss patterns on how morphemes combine and stand
in relation to each other (5.2.1, 5.2.2 and 5.2.3) and show that the traditional way of clas-
sifying languages obscures much of the morphological complexity that languages of the
world may have. I then bring up the issue of how much information words may carry
(5.2.4). Finally, in Section 5.3 I give an overview of sign language morphology and how
it both overlaps with and differs from spoken language morphology.
5.1	 The building blocks of words
This section is meant as a very quick overview of the basic concepts of morphology. It
is by no means exhaustive. For very accessible introductions to morphology, see, for
example, Haspelmath (2002) and Bauer (2003). For a more in-depth overview of the
various concepts, including a set of language descriptions, see, for example, Spencer
& Zwicky (1998) and Booij et al. (2000).
Morphology is the study of shapes. We have seen that languages make use of small
contrastive units that in themselves don’t convey any meaning, phonemes. The smallest
unit of a language that does convey some kind of information is a morpheme. And just as
a phoneme is a linguistic abstraction, which can be realized in different ways (allophoni-
cally), so a morpheme is an abstraction of the various types of morphs that a language
has. For instance, in English the concept of plural can be realized in several different
ways: as â•‚s (cat/cats), â•‚z (dog/dogs [dɒgz]), â•‚es (dish/dishes), â•‚en (ox/oxen), â•‚Ø (sheep/
sheep), or a vowel change in the stem (foot/feet). All of these individual morphs convey
the same piece of information, namely that of ‘plural’, and as such are allomorphs.
Morphemes can be either free or bound. A free morpheme stands alone as its own
word, while a bound morpheme needs some kind of host to attach to. In the sentence
90	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
He will go home tomorrow there are only free morphemes, while the sentence The oxen
pulled the chart contains two bound morphemes, â•‚en and â•‚ed in oxen and pulled. These
two bound morphemes, conveying the information of ‘plural’ and ‘past tense’ respec-
tively, cannot stand alone as their own words, but have to attach to a host.
The root of a word is the smallest unit – and as such is a morpheme – with any
semantic content. For instance, the semantic content of hair is conveyed through its
root hair. This root can then be modified, for example by adding the plural marker â•‚s
to form the word hairs. The root of unhappiness is happy, which has been modified with
unâ•‚ and â•‚ness. A stem is the base for an inflected word form. It can consist minimally
of a root, but may also be a modification of the root in some way. For instance the
stem horsehair is a compound of the two roots horse + hair. The stem can be modified
for plural to form horsehairs. If we add â•‚er to the root teach we get the stem teacher,
to which the plural marker â•‚s can be added, teachers. If we add â•‚ness to the root happy
we get the stem happiness, which can be further modified to the stem unhappiness,
and so on.
In English roots and stems tend to be free, but there are many languages where they
are bound. For instance, the verbs in the Semitic languages tend to consist of a root of
only three consonants, which, through different vowel modifications, are formed into
stems that then take the various inflectional markers for person and number. Thus
the Hebrew root gdr ‘to enclose’ has the stem gadarâ•‚ in the past tense, to which the
person/number affixes are added: gadarâ•‚ti (1sg) ‘I enclosed’, gadarâ•‚ta (2sg.m) ‘you (m)
enclosed’, and so on; but for the present tense the root is modified with a different set
of vowels, to the stem goderâ•‚, which then inflects for person and number (Glinert 1989:
471). The root gdr does not function as its own word and is therefore bound. Likewise,
the Spanish root hablâ•‚ ‘speak’ cannot function in discourse without an ending and is
therefore also bound. A stem may also be bound, for example the Columbia-Wenatchi
(Salishan (Interior Salish): USA) verb nkwnámâ•‚ ‘sing’, which consists of a root (kwan
‘cut’) and two affixes (nâ•‚ ‘in’ and â•‚am ‘middle voice’) (Willett 2003:â•›37). To this stem
the various necessary inflectional markers are then added.
The root and stem carry lexemic information, i.e. the basic semantic information
of the word. For instance, the lexeme of work, works, worked and working is work (by
convention the lexeme of a word is written in small capitals to distinguish it from the
various grammatical forms the words can take), the lexeme of both hair and hairs is
hair and the lexeme of both horsehair and horsehairs is horsehair. An affix, on the
other hand, is an obligatorily bound morpheme which does not carry any lexemic
information. Affixes can be derivational or inflectional. Derivational affixes are those
that create new words, for instance unâ•‚ and â•‚ness in unhappiness or â•‚ly in beautifully.
Inflectional affixes are those which carry grammatical information, such as â•‚s ‘plural’
or â•‚ed ‘past tense’.
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 91
There are four types of affixes. A prefix attaches itself to the beginning of a host
word. An example of a derivational prefix is unâ•‚ in unhappy. Logba is an example of a
language with inflectional prefixes:
		 Logba (Niger-Congo (Kwa): Ghana)
	 (18)	 ókpé	 inashína
		 ó-kpé	 i-nashína
		 3sg-know	 cm-everybody
		 ‘He knows everybody.’ (Dorvlo 2008:â•›31)
In (18) the person/number marking and the noun class marking attaches to the begin-
ning of the host word.
A suffix attaches to the end of the host word. An example of a derivational suffix
is â•‚ness in happiness. The English past tense marker â•‚ed is an example of an inflectional
suffix. It is far more common for languages to make use of suffixes than of prefixes in
inflectional morphology. Discounting the languages in Dryer’s (2011w) database that
had only little affixation (141 of 971) we get 830 languages. Of these, 530 (63.9%) are suf-
fixingâ†œ55 while 153 (18.4%) are prefixing and 147 (17.7%) are equally prefixing and suffixing.
An infix is an affix which places itself inside a morpheme, usually a root or a
stem. For instance in Leti (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia),
nominalizationsâ†œ56 are derived from the verb through the infix â•‚niâ•‚: consider kakri
‘to cry’ > kniakri (k-ni-akri) ‘(the) act of crying’ and pali ‘to float’ > pniali (p-ni-ali)
‘(the) act of floating’ (Blevins 1999:â•›400). An example of inflectional infixation can
be found in Maranao (Austronesian (Southern Philippines): Philippines), where â•‚iâ•‚
marks past tense: tabasan ‘slash’ > tiabasan (t-i-abasan) ‘slashed’ (Reid 1992:â•›73 citing
McKaughan 1958:â•›28).
We speak of a circumfix when at least two types of affixation have to occur at the
beginning and at the end of the host at the same time. An example of an inflectional
circumfix is, for example, the German past participle, which is formed by simultane-
ously prefixing geâ•‚ and suffixing â•‚t to the verbal stem: lieben ‘to love’ (stem liebâ•‚) >
geliebt (ge-lieb-t) ‘(had) loved’. Leaving out any one of the two affixes would make the
construction ungrammatical; something like *gelieb is not acceptable. An example of
a derivational circumfix is the Indonesian (Austronesian (Malayic): Indonesia) keâ•‚…
â•‚an, which derives (abstract) nouns, as in kebebasan (ke-bebas-an) ‘freedom’ from the
adjective bebas ‘free’ (Sneddon 1996:â•›35).
55.	 I have conflated Dryer’s categories ‘weakly suffixing’ and ‘strongly suffixing’ as well as ‘weakly
prefixing’ and ‘strongly prefixing’ into ‘suffixing’ and ‘prefixing’ respectively.
56.	 A nominalization is the process of forming a noun from a word belonging to some other part-
of-speech, for example a verb or an adjective.
92	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Some languages also have parafixes, where the two affixes that have to occur at
the same time do not necessarily attach at the beginning and end of the host word.
For instance, some Leti nominalizations are derived with iâ•‚ + â•‚iâ•‚, as in natu ‘to send’ >
iniatu (i-n-i-atu) ‘(the) act of sending, dispatch’, nòa ‘to advise’ > iniòa (i-n-i-òa) ‘(the)
act of advising, advice’ (Blevins 1999:â•›402). Here the combination of affixes consists of
a prefix iâ•‚ and an infix â•‚iâ•‚. Another example is the Ilocano (Austronesian (Northern
Philippines): Philippines) reciprocal consisting of the prefix agâ•‚ plus the infix â•‚inn-,
as in sakit ‘hurt’ > agsinnakit ‘hurt one another’ (ag-s-inn-akit) (Schachter & Shopen
2007:â•›29). Just as with the circumfix mentioned above, both of these affixes must occur
at the same time for the construction to be grammatical.
criss-cross of affixes
The Sambuḡãu dialect of Chintang (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): Nepal) offers an interesting example
of a combination of affixes.
amaikhatuptace
a-mai-kha-tup-t-a-ce
2A-[neg]1-[1du.excl.P]1-meet-[neg]2-past-[1du.excl.P]2
‘You (sg/du/pl) didn’t meet us (du.exclusive).’ (Bickel et al. 2007:â•›54)
Here we have one prefix (aâ•‚‘2nd person agent’), one suffix (â•‚a‘past tense’) and two parafixes
(â•‚mai-…-t‑ ‘negation’ and â•‚kha-…‑ce ‘1st person dual exclusive patient’). I have glossed the
parafixes in square brackets and with subscript numbers in order to better illustrate which
elements belong together. Notice that both parafixes are broken up by other affixes: we do
not have something like *a-mai-kha-tup-ce-t-a, where â•‚mai-…‑tâ•‚ and â•‚kha-…‑ce attach sym-
metrically around something. Instead, mai‑…‑t is“interrupted”by the first part of â•‚kha‑…‑ce
(â•‚kha-…) while ‑kha‑…‑ce is“interrupted”by the last part of â•‚mai-…‑t (…‑t‑) as well as by the
past marker â•‚a‑, as shown by the connecting lines.
Another type of bound morpheme is clitics. The basic difference between clitics and
affixes is that while both are phonologically dependent on a host, a clitic is syntactically
independent from its host while an affix is not.57 That is, affixes can only attach to the
kinds of hosts that match their category (part-of-speech; for a further discussion on
parts-of-speech, see Chapter 6). For instance, verbal affixes, such as the English past
tense marker â•‚ed, can only attach to verbs; plural marking affixes, which have to do
57.	 For an in-depth discussion on clitics and how they differ from affixes, see, for example, Anderson
(2005).
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 93
with counting items and therefore belong to the category of nouns, can only attach to
nouns, and so on. Clitics, on the other hand, are not restricted to the kind of category
they may attach to. The reason they get the host that they get is because of position:
they attach to the word immediately in front or after them (or inside them, as the case
may be). In English, for example, the future marked will may cliticize to a host word.
The host is always the word that immediately precedes the future marker, irrespective
of what category that word belongs to. Thus the future marker will in the sentence The
dog will bark may attach to dog to form the sentence The dog’ll bark, even though will is
a verbal auxiliary and belongs to the verb phrase while dog is a noun and belongs to the
noun phrase. The reduced form ’ll is thus a clitic and not a suffix: the reason it attaches
to a word has to do with prosody and not grammar. Another difference between clit-
ics and affixes is that clitics may function as a constituent (for more information on
constituents, see Chapter 10) on their own, while an affix can never do that. Consider
the Italian sentence in (19):
		 Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italy)
	 (19)	 è	 venuto	 per	 parlarmi
		 è	 venuto	 per	 parl-ar=miâ†œ58
		 3sg.is	 come.pfct	 to	 talk-inf=1sg.O
		 ‘He has come to talk to me.’  (source: personal knowledge)
The infinitive affix â•‚are, which gets reduced to â•‚ar if a clitic attaches after it, does not
form any constituent of its own but simply serves to give grammatical information
about the verb. The clitic =mi, on the other hand, does form a constituent of its own:
it is the object of the sentence.
Very often clitics are a reduced version of a free counterpart while affixes are not.
For instance, the future marker in English can either be the bound form ’ll or the free
form will, but the past tense marked â•‚ed is neither reduced, nor does it have any free
counterpart.
Just as affixes may attach at different places on (or in or around) their host, so
clitics may attach at different places. A proclitic attaches at the beginning of the host.
French pronouns may attach proclitically:
		 French (Indo-European (Romance): France)
	 (20)	 j’attends
		 1sg=wait.pres
		 ‘I’m waiting.’  (source: personal knowledge)
58.	 Following convention, I distinguish between affixes and clitics by using a dash (-) between the
affix and its host but the equal sign (=) between a clitic and its host.
94	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
A clitic that attaches at the end of the host is an enclitic (sometimes called postclitic).
The Italian pronouns may attach enclitically, as shown in (19). A mesoclitic attaches
itself between the host and the inflectional affixes. This is very rare indeed cross-lin-
guistically, but can be found in European Portuguese59 (Examples (21) and (22)) and
in the northern dialects of Modern Greek (Example (23)).
		 Portuguese (Indo-European (Romance): Portugal)
	 (21)	 pedirlheia
		 pedir=lhe=ia
		 ask.inf=3sg.m=1sg.cond
		 ‘I would ask him.’  (Vigário 2003:â•›270)
	 (22)	 os	 teus	 amigos	 emprestarteão	 livros
		 os	 teus	 amigos	 emprestar=te=ão	 livros
		 3pl.m	 2sg.poss	 friend.pl	 lend.inf=2sg=3pl.fut	 book.pl
		 ‘Your friends will lend you books.’  (Vigário 2003:â•›245)
		 Modern Greek (Indo-European (Greek): Greece)
	 (23)	 fériméti
		 féri=mé=ti
		 bring.2imp=1sg=pl
		 ‘(You.pl) bring (to) me!’  (Joseph 1988:â•›210)
In Examples (21) to (23) above, the pronoun (bolded) cliticizes between the verbal
stem and its inflectional affixes. In each of the examples, the pronoun functions as
its own constituent, namely as 3rd person singular object pronoun in Example (21),
2nd person singular object pronoun in Example (22) and 1st person singular object
pronoun in Example (23).60
Another extremely rare form of clitic is the endoclitic, which places itself inside
the root or stem. Udi (Examples (24) and (25)) and Pashto (Example (26)) are the only
two languages currently known to have endoclitics.61
59.	 While it may occasionally be used in Brazilian Portuguese too, this is considered extremely for-
mal language (see e.g. Azevedo 2005). Instead, the mesoclitic is preposed to the verb, which would
yield something like lhe pediria in Example (21) and te emprestarão in Example (22).
60.	 The Ingush (Nakh-Daghestanian (Nakh): Russia) clitic ʔa might also be a case of mesoclisis,
since it can attach before inflectional affixes and even between the base and the reduplicated part of
the base; cf. Peterson (2001).
61.	 I am grateful to Kathryn and Nur Khairi-Taraki for their time and effort in explaining the intrica-
cies of Pashto pronunciation to me.
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 95

		 pasčaɣ-un	 ɣar-en	 gölö	 bẹ=ne=ɣ-sa	 met’a-laxo
		 king-gen	 boy-erg	 much	 look1=3sg=look2-pres	 this.gen-on
		 ‘The prince looks at this for a long time.’ (root: bẹɣ-)  (Harris 2000:â•›598)
	 (25)	 kaɣuzax	 azq’e
		 kaɣuz-ax	 a=z=q’-e
		 letter-dat	 receive1=1sg=receive2-aorII
		 ‘I received the letter.’ (root: aq’-)  (Ibid.)
		 Pashto (Indo-European (Iranian): Afghanistan, Pakistan)
	 (26)	 a.	 aǧustə́	 me
			 wear	 1sg
			 ‘I was wearing (it).’
		 b.	 á=me=ǧustə
			 wear1=1sg=wear2
			 ‘I was wearing (it).’ (root: aǧust-)  (Tegey 1978:â•›89)
In all three of the above examples, the verbal root is broken up by the pronominal clitic.
The Udi verbal roots in (24) and (25) are bẹɣâ•‚ ‘watch, look (at)’ and aq’â•‚ ‘take, receive’
respectively and the Pashto verbal root in (26) is aǧustâ•‚ ‘wear’. In Udi the endoclitic
places itself immediately before the last element of the root. I have adopted Harris’ nota-
tional convention in glossing the two parts of the root with the same translation plus a
subscripted number in order to indicate which segments belong together as one lexeme.
Thus the root bẹɣâ•‚ is chopped into the parts bẹâ•‚ and â•‚ɣâ•‚ and the root aq’â•‚ is chopped
into aâ•‚ and â•‚q’-. In Pashto the placement of the pronoun obeys prosodic constraints in
that the pronoun immediately follows the stressed syllable of the verb: if the stress is
on the last syllable of the inflected verb, the pronoun follows as a free morpheme. If,
however, the stress is on the first syllable of the inflected verb, the pronoun cliticizes
immediately after the stressed syllable. Again, notice that the clitic is not an inflectional
affix signalling the grammar of the verb, but a completely different part-of-speech (it is
a pronoun) belonging syntactically to the noun phrase and not the verb phrase. In (24)
the endoclitic ne is part of the object, while z in (25) and me in (26) are both subjects.
5.2	 Morphological typology
Since the nineteenth century and von Schlegel’s classification of morphological types
(cf. 1.1), languages have been classified along a linear scale of morphological typology,
with isolating languages on one end and fusional languages on the other, where agglu-
tinating languages fall in the middle; or, alternatively, adding a fourth category after
96	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
fusional languages, introflexive. This would yield something like (27) with the classic
example languages given below each category.
	 (27)	 isolating	 >	 agglutinative	 >	 fusional	 (>	 introflexive)62
		 Mandarin		 Turkish		 Latin		 (Standard) Arabic
Traditionally, the view has been that whole languages could be classified in this man-
ner, leading to statements like “Chinese is an isolating language” and “Turkish is an
agglutinating language” and so on.
Bickel & Nichols (2007) have shown that this linear scale actually merges three
different parameters, fusion, exponence and flexion, all of which are in themselves
relevant for morphological typology and all of which may combine with each other.
Also, any given language may employ a variety of combinations of these parameters,
a fact which is obscured if we make whole-language typology statements, as already
argued by Edward Sapir (see 1.1 above). In the following I will adopt Bickel & Nichol’s
classification of parameters. I will also adopt their approach of classifying individual
morphological processes rather than whole languages.
Very simplified, the three parameters mentioned have to do with how morphemes
combine. Yet another, fourth, parameter is that of synthesis, which – again very simpli-
fied – has to do with how much grammatical information a word may carry.63 I stress
once again that we are dealing with the behaviour of individual morphological pro-
cesses in languages, which does not necessarily equate with the behaviour of languages
as wholes. For instance, almost all languages have isolating morphemes, even if they
allow other kinds of fusion. However, languages do differ as to what kinds of morpho-
logical combinations they tend to employ. In other words, stating that a language is
predominantly isolating or predominantly non-linear may serve to give a general idea
of what kinds of morphological processes to expect in the given language.
5.2.1	 	 Fusion
Fusion denotes the degree to which morphological markers (or formatives in Bickel
& Nichols’ terminology) attach to a host stem. Following Bickel & Nichols (2007 and
2011b) I distinguish three types of fusion. A marker that stands alone as a free mor-
pheme, that is, as an independent word, is isolating. Markers that are bound, i.e. that
have to attach to a host, are concatenative. Markers that involve modifying the host
in some way are non-linear.
62.	 This last stage essentially refers to the “root-and-pattern” typically found in Semitic languages.
See below.
63.	 In actuality I am here merging two different concepts, that of the phonological word (units of
form) and that of the grammatical word (units of grammatical analysis).
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 97
Languages may employ any and all of the types of fusion mentioned. For instance,
English has isolating markers (e.g. the modal must in He must be home by now), con-
catenative markers (e.g. plural â•‚s in tree (sg) versus trees (pl)) and non-linear markers
(the ablaut in sing – sang – sung). Because of this, and because it is impossible to give
a complete inventory of grammatical markers for each and every language, Bickel &
Nichols (2011b) sampled their languages for grammatical case and for tense/mood/
aspect (TMA) markers64. The patterns and tendencies mentioned below thus refer to
the morphological typology of languages in these grammatical domains only. Unless
otherwise mentioned, the figures in this section are based on Bickel & Nichols (2011b).
5.2.1.1	 Isolating markers
Most languages have at least some markers that stand in phonological isolation and
thus function as individual words. An example in English would be the modal must,
as in He must be in his office. However, there are languages where all or almost all
grammatical information is conveyed though isolating markers. In Koyra Chiini, for
example, most markers are isolating.

		 ‘I here whom you (pl) see.’  (Heath 1999:â•›97)
In (28) all grammatical information is expressed as individual words, even the tense
of the verb (the imperfect marker o).
Isolation is not very common cross-linguistically. 16 languages (of 165 or 9.7%) in
Bickel & Nichols’ database are listed as exclusively isolating, mainly clustered in South
East Asia and West Africa but with two Austronesian Oceanic languages (Fijian in Fiji
and Rapanui on the Easter Island) and three South American languages, Wari’, Kipea
(Kariri (Kariri): Brazil) and Wichí (Matacoan (Matacoan): Argentina). Only one lan-
guage (0.6%), Yoruba, combines isolation with non-linear (tonal) processes, while 13
(7.9%), relatively widely scattered over the world, combine isolation with concatenation.
5.2.1.2	 Concatenative (linear) markers
The term concatenative literally means ‘chaining together’ (from Latin con ‘with’ +
catena ‘chain’). The crucial feature of concatenative markers, apart from the fact that
they are bound, is that they chain together in linear strings, which means that they
are segmentable. A typical example of a language with concatenative constructions is
Chichewa, where the various markers attach linearly to the stems.
64.	 For a detailed description on how they sampled their values, see Bickel & Nichols (2011b).

		 i-hunter	 i.sm-one	 i.sm-past-come	 with	 iv-spears
		 ‘One hunter came with spears.’  (Mchombo 1998:â•›518)
In (29) the grammatical markers for noun class (i m/a and iv mi) and past tense (na)
are bound and are relatively straightforward to segment into morphemes.
Concatenation is a very frequent process indeed: a full 125 (75.8%) languages in
Bickel & Nichols’ database make use of concatenation exclusively for case and TMA
marking. As mentioned above, some languages combine concatenation with isolation.
Seven languages combine concatenation with non-linearity: two (1.2% of the sample)
Nilo-Saharan languages (Maasai and Nandi in Kenya, both Nilotic) combine concat-
enation with tone while five (3%) languages, Hebrew, Egyptian Arabic (Semitic: Egypt),
Middle Atlas Berber (Berber: Morocco), Beja (Beja: Sudan) (all Afro-Asiatic) and
Lugbara (Nilo-Saharan (Moru-Ma’di): Uganda), combine concatenation with ablaut.
5.2.1.3	 Non-linear markers
Non-linear markers involve some kind of modification to the host stem and are, as
the term implies, not straightforward to segment into chains of morphemes. There are
a number of ways that languages modify their stems nonlinearly. A very well-known
strategy is found in Semitic languages, where a root consists only of a set of consonants
(usually three) and where grammatical information is conveyed through insertion of
a pattern of vowels, commonly termed the “root-and-pattern” (Ussishkin 2006:â•›37)
but which is termed ablaut in Bickel & Nichols (2011b). Neither the root nor the vowel
pattern can function on its own. Modern Hebrew is a language with such a pattern;
an example of one kind of conjugation is the group belonging to the so-called pa’al
verbs, as shown in (30).
		 Hebrew, Modern (Afro-Asiatic (Semitic): Israel)
	 (30)	 g-d-r ‘enclose’
		 past:	 a-a	 (CaCaC):	 gadar	 ‘enclosed’
		 present:	 o-e	 (CoCeC):	 goder	 ‘encloses’
		 future:	 yi-Ø-o	 (yiCCoC):	 yigdor	 ‘will enclose’
		 imperative:	 Ø-o	 (CCoC):	 gdor	 ‘enclose!’
		 infinitive:	 li-Ø-o	 (liCCoC):	 ligdor	 ‘to enclose’  (Glinert 1989:â•›471)
In the above example, the root consonants remain the same, but the stem is modified
for tense through a set of vowel combinations, none of which can be segmented into
a linear string of morphemes. To indicate past tense, the root has to be modified with
the vowels a-a to form the stem gadarâ•‚; to indicate present tense, the root has to be
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 99
modified with the vowels o-e to for the stem goderâ•‚; and so on. This grammatical infor-
mation is not easily segmentable into a string of affixes, which makes it a non-linear
process. Agreement affixes (for instance -ti for ‘1sg’) may then be added concatena-
tively to the various stems.
Another example of ablaut (also called gradation or vowel gradation) is found in
the strong verbs in Germanic languages, where inflection is marked through changes
in the root vowel quality, as in English sing – sang – sung (present – past – past parti-
ciple). Again we are not able to readily segment the words into a string of morphemes
along the lines of sing-past or sing-past.ptcpl since the grammatical information is
given through modifying the stem.
Ablaut is quite rare cross-linguistically; none of the languages in Bickel & Nichols’
sample make exclusive use of ablaut, while only five combine ablaut with concatena-
tion (and none combines ablaut with isolation).
Suprasegmentals (or prosodic formatives in Bickel & Nichols 2007), involving
tone, stress and length, are another type of non-linear morphological processes. Tone
is a well-known morphological strategy, common in continental South East Asia and
in sub-Saharan Africa. An example of a language with grammatical tone is Lango.
		 Lango (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Uganda)
	 (31)	 a.	 àpônnê
			 1sg.hide.pfv.mid
			 ‘I hide myself.’
		 b.	 ápònnê
			 1sg.hide.prog.mid
			 ‘I am hiding myself.’  (Noonan 1992:â•›101)
The difference between the perfective in (31a) and the progressive in (31b) is indicated
through change of tone: a falling tone on àâ•‚ plus a rising-falling tone on â•‚ôâ•‚ for the
perfective versus a rising tone áâ•‚ plus a falling tone â•‚òâ•‚ for progressive. In neither case
are the words possible to segment into a linear sequence of morphemes.
While tone is a frequent feature in the languages of the world (see 4.2.3.2), not
many make use of tone to convey the grammatical information sampled in Bickel &
Nichols. Six languages (3.6%) make use of tone, three of them exclusively – Iau (Lakes
Plain (Lakes Plain): Indonesia), Kisi (Niger-Congo (Southern Atlantic): Guinea) and
Lango – one, as mentioned above, combines tone with isolation and two, also men-
tioned above, combine tone with concatenation. It seems reasonable to assume that
the rarity of tone in the sample is partly due to the non-proportionality to language
density pointed out by Maddieson (2011f) and quoted above (4.2.3.2).
The use of stress to convey grammatical information can, for instance, be found in
Italian, as in the example mentioned above (4.2.3.3): /ˈcantɔ/ ‘I sing’ and /canˈtɔ / ‘I sang’.
100	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
An example of length serving as a morphological process can be found in the Agar Dinka
(Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Sudan) case system, where the difference between tô̰oc ‘swampy.
area.absolutive’ and tô̰ooc ‘swampy.area.locative’ (Andersen 2002:â•›13) is only that the
locative form lengthens the vowel. In other words, there are no affixes to segment.
Replacement or substitution is when a regular marker replaces a part of the stem,
something which is common in Nilotic languages (Bickel & Nichols 2007:â•›182). For
instance, in Lango â•‚ê is a common plural marker that attaches to the stem. However,
if the stem ends in a vowel, the final stem vowel is replaced by the plural marker.
Compare, for instance Example (32), where â•‚â in bʊ́râ is replaced by the plural â•‚ê.
		 Lango (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Uganda)
	 (32)	 singular	 plural	 gloss
		 rɛ́c	 récê	 ‘fish’
		 bʊ́râ	 bùrê	 ‘cat’  (Noonan 1992:â•›83)
Another type of replacement is suppletion, where a root or stem is paradigmatically
replaced by a root or stem of a different etymological origin. For instance, in English
the verb to go is inflected for past with a completely different stem, went, which is not
a cognate (does not have the same historical origin) with go.65
	 (33)	 She goes to school. (present tense)	 ~	 She went to school. (past tense)
A rare type of non-linear process is subtraction, where the grammatical information
lies in taking out an element of the stem. For instance, in Nuer (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic):
Sudan) some plurals are formed by shortening the vowel of the stem, as in ka̱a̱t ‘vul-
ture.sg’ versus ka̱t ‘vulture.pl’ (Wright 1999:â•›33). In O’odham (Uto-Aztecan (Tepiman):
USA) the perfective form is regularly derived by subtracting the final consonant from
the imperfective form, as in hi:nk (imperfective) versus hi:n (perfective) ‘bark’ (Bickel
& Nichols 2007:â•›183).
5.2.1.4	 Reduplication
Reduplication falls somewhere in between concatenation and non-linear processes.
Because the languages many of us are used to, such as western European languages,
do not productively employ reduplication, we might not be aware of how common a
strategy it is. A full 84.7% (312 of 368 languages) of Rubino’s (2011) sample has produc-
tive reduplication. English is part of the minority group of 56 languages which has no
productive reduplication. Map 5.1 shows the patterning of reduplicating versus non-
reduplicating languages in Rubino’s sample.
65.	 For a detailed discussion on suppletion, see Veselinova (2006).

Reduplication involves copying a set amount of phonological material from a base
form (root or stem) and fusing it with that base to form a stem onto which other mor-
phemes may then be added. It is less linear than concatenative morphemes in that the
form of the reduplicant (the repeated element) is dependent on the form of the base,
since it is a part of the base that is being repeated. However, it is more straightforward
to segment a reduplicated form than other types of non-linear processes; once the
pattern for the repetition, the reduplicative skeleton, has been identified, it can be
argued that reduplication is simply “affixation … of a skeletal morpheme” (Marantz
1982:â•›456). The figures for the cross-linguistic patterns in this subsection are based on
Rubino (2011).
Reduplication can be either full or partial, and while the reduplicant usually
attaches immediately to the root it has its shape from, there are also languages with so-
called discontinuous reduplication, where other morphological material may appear
between the reduplicant and the base. Furthermore, reduplication can be simple or
complex. In simple reduplication the reduplicant merely repeats a given amount of
material from the base. Complex reduplication involves taking material from the base
and partly altering it.
Full reduplication involves copying the whole base. Most languages allow both full
and partial reduplication. However, 35 languages (9.5%) in Rubino’s database allow
full reduplication only. An example of a language with full simple reduplication is
Erromangan, where reduplication indicates intensification.
102	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Erromangan (Austronesian (Oceanic): Vanuatu)
	 (34)	 /unmeh/ ‘early’	 ~	 /unmehunmeh/ ‘very early’
		 /ilar/ ‘shine’	 ~	 /ilarilar/ ‘shine brightly’  (Crowley 1998:â•›34)
An example of a full complex reduplication (also called ‘echo constructions’, ‘echo
reduplication’ or ‘alliterative repetition’, e.g. Aikhenvald 2007:â•›46) can be found in
Persian, where the reduplicated form changes the initial consonant to either /m/ or
/p/ of the copied element. The reduplicated form takes a meaning of what we might
call ‘scattered generality’, most closely equivalent to English ‘and so forth’.
		 Persian (Indo-European (Iranian): Iran)
	 (35)	 bâlâ ‘above’	 ~	 bâlâmala ‘somewhere above’
		 mive ‘fruit’	 ~	 mivepive ‘fruit and so on’  (Ghaniabadi et al. 2006:â•›3)
Partial reduplication involves copying only a set part of the base and may involve a
number of different forms. It can be a set of phonemes (C, CV, CVCV, and so on), a
set of syllables or a set of morae (the minimal unit of metrical weight) that is copied
(Rubino 2011). Most languages allow both partial and full reduplication, and this cat-
egory, with 277 languages (75.3%), is by far the largest group in Rubino’s database.
In Thao the instrumental is expressed by Caâ•‚ reduplication, which means that the
fist consonant of the base is copied and â•‚aâ•‚ is added (also called a duplifix, Haspelmath
2002:â•›24):
		 Thao (Austronesian (Paiwanic): Taiwan)
	 (36)	 finshiq ‘to sow’	 ~	 fafinshiq ‘seed for planting’
				 f-a-finshiq
		 cput ‘to filter’	 ~	 cacput ‘sieve’
				 c-a-cput
		 kishkish ‘to shave, cut’	 ~	 kakishkish ‘razor’
				 k-a-kishkish (Chang 1998:â•›282)
Ilocano is an example of a language with several types of reduplication.
		 Ilocano (Austronesian (Northern Philippines): Philippines)
	 (37)	 -V-	 kumrad	 >	 kumraad		 ‘creak’
					 kumra-a-d
		 C-	 lalaki	 >	 lallaki		 ‘boys’
					 la-l-laki
		 CV-	 nuang	 >	 nunuang		 ‘eater buffaloes’
					 nu-nuang
		 CVC-	 bato	 >	 batbato		 ‘stones’
					 bat-bato
		 CVCV-	 tapiken	 >	 tapitapikean		 ‘pat repeatedly’
					 tapi-tapikean

					 rupan-rupa
			 pateg	 >	 patempateg		 ‘mutual caring’
					 patem-pateg	 (Rubino 2000: xvii)
An example of a partial complex reduplication can be found in Nakanai, where the
vowel in the copied VC skeleton is changed to the vowel immediately preceding the
reduplicant.
		 Nakanai (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
	 (38)	 haro ‘day’ (sg)	 ~	 hararo ‘days’ (pl)

		 velo ‘bubbling’	 ~	 velelo ‘bubbling forth’
				 ve-le-lo
		 hilo ‘see’	 ~	 hililo ‘seeing’ (prog)
				 hi-li-lo
		 baharu ‘widow’	 ~	 bahararu ‘widows’ (pl)
				 baha-ra-ru 
 (McCarthy & Broselow 1983:â•›74 citing Johnston 1980:â•›149)
Automatic reduplication is when an affix obligatorily triggers reduplication but the
reduplication itself does not add any meaning to the construction. An example of an
automatic reduplication can be found in Tagalog, where adjectives are derived by pre-
fixing ka-, which triggers a reduplication of the first two syllables of the word.
		 Tagalog (Austronesian (Meso-Philippine): Philippines)
	 (39)	 wilih ‘interested’	 ~	 kawilihwilih ‘interesting’
				 ka-wilih-wilih
		 panabik ‘excitement’	 ~	 kapanapanabik ‘exciting’
				 ka-pana-panabik  (French 1988:â•›50)
As mentioned, the reduplicant might be separated from the base by some particle.
An example of such a discontinuous reduplication can be found in the Manila Bay
Creoles, which is a cover term for Ternateño, Caviteño, and Ermiteño, where the linker
â•‚ngâ•‚ sits between the reduplicant and the base.
		 Manila Bay Creoles (Creole (Spanish-lexified): Philippines)
	 (40)	 buníta ‘beautiful’	 ~	 bunitangbuníta ‘very beautiful’
					 bunita-ng-buníta  (Grant 2003:â•›205)
66.	 N stands for ‘any nasal’.
104	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In terms of proportion the languages in APiCS behave almost exactly like the lan-
guages in WALS (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 26). After subtracting the three creoles
in Rubino’s sample, 84.7% (309 of 365) of the WALS languages have some kind of pro-
ductive reduplication (either full or partial or both), leaving 15.3% languages with no
productive reduplication. Of the languages in APiCS 86.8% (66 of 76) have some form
of reduplication while 13.2% do not have any reduplication. In other words, pidgins
and creoles do not seem to behave differently from non-creole languages in terms of
employing the morphological process of reduplication.
5.2.2	 	 Exponence
Languages also differ as to how many grammatical categories may be expressed by one
and the same morpheme. Separative (or monoexponential) morphemes encode only
one single category, while cumulative (or polyexponential, also called portmanteau,
e.g. Booij 2005) morphemes encode several things at the same time. This parameter
may interact with fusion, so that we get six logical combinations: isolating, concatena-
tive and non-linear separative markers plus isolating, concatenative and non-linear
cumulative markers. In Table 5.1 languages with examples of each of the six logical
types of processes are listed.
Table 5.1â•‡ The six logical combinations of fusion and exponence.
Isolating Concatenative Non-linear
Separative Kasong (41) Meithei (42) Dinka (43)
Cumulative Wari’ (44) Spanish (45) Modern Hebrew (46)
Kasong offers an example of isolating separative markers. Each of the markers is a free
morpheme, i.e. they are isolating, and each of them conveys only one piece of informa-
tion, i.e. the markers are separative:
		 Kasong (Austro-Asiatic (Pearic): Thailand)
	 (41)	 nak	 kamlaŋ	 lɔ:ŋ	 ce:w	 priÌ„
		 3.sg	 prog	 fut	 go	 forest
		 ‘S/he will be going to the forest.’  (Sunee 2003:â•›173)
In (41) the progressive marker and the future marker both form separate words.
Meithei (Sino-Tibetan (Kuki-Chin): India) offers an example of concatenative
separative markers. The markers fuse concatenatively with a host stem; they are lin-
early segmentable and each of the segments is separative in that each conveys only one
piece of information.
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 105
		 Meithei (Sino-Tibetan (Kuki-Chin): India)
	 (42)	 əynə	 thəŋ	 əmənə	 hə́ydu	 kháy
		 əy-nə	 thəŋ	 ə-mə-nə	 hə́y-tu	 kháy-i
		 1.sg-cntr	 knife	 att-one-inst	 fruit-ddet	 cut-nhyp
		 ‘I cut the fruit with a knife.’  (Chelliah 1997:â•›128)
In the Dinka example mentioned above, repeated here, we have an instance of a non-
linear separative process, where the absolutive and locative cases are distinguished
only through phonological length. The marker (length) conveys only the information
of case, and is as such separative, but it is not possible to segment from the host word,
and is therefore non-linear.
		 Dinka (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Sudan)
	 (43)	 tô̰oc	 ~	 tô̰ooc
		 ‘swampy.area.absolutive’		 ‘swampy.area.locative’  (Andersen 2002:â•›13)
Wari’ is an example a language with isolating markers, that is, the morphemes form
separate words. However, they are cumulative in that they contain more than one
piece of grammatical information, and this information is not possible to segment into
smaller units. Example (44) thus shows an isolating cumulative process.
		 Wari’ (Chapacura-Wanhan (Chapacura-Wanhan): Brazil)
	 (44)	 ma’	 co	 tomi	 na
		 that.prox.hearer	 infl.m/frp/p	 speak	 3sg.rp/p.vic
		 ‘Who is speaking?’  (Everett 1998:â•›692)
In (44) each of the morphemes are separate words, ma’, co and na, but each conveys
a bundle of grammatical information, and none of the words can be analysed further
into smaller parts. Spanish also makes use of cumulative markers that fuse concatena-
tively onto the stem, which gives us a concatenative cumulative morphological process.
		 Spanish (Indo-European (Romance): Spain)
	 (45)	 habl-ó
		 speak-3sg.past.ind.pfv
		 ‘He spoke.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In (45) the verbal inflection marker â•‚ó is bound and conveys a host of information all at
the same time. In Hebrew, on the other hand, we have a non-linear cumulative process:
a similar amount of information as in the Spanish example above is expressed through
only one single process, but the process involves modifying the root itself and is thus
non-linear. Consider, for example, the future tense of the verbal root g-d-r ‘to enclose’
mentioned above and repeated here:
106	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Modern Hebrew (Afro-Asiatic (Semitic): Israel)
	 (46)	 g-d-r ‘enclose’
		 future active indicative:	 yigdor	 ‘will enclose’
		 future passive indicative:	 yigader	 ‘will be enclosed’  (Glinert 1989:â•›471)
In (46) the way the stem is modified conveys more than one piece of information: the
tense, the voice, and the mood. However, this grammatical information is not linearly
segmentable:ifyouwanttochangeanyofthegrammaticalinformation,forinstancefrom
active voice to passive voice, you have to modify the root to an entirely different stem.
It is much more common for languages to have separative morphemes than cumu-
lative. In Bickel & Nichols’ (2011a) database 127 languages (or 79.4%) have separative
markers for tense/mood/aspect, while 29 (18.1%) have cumulative markers (and four
are listed as not having tense/mood/aspect marking).67 The picture differs for case
marking, although again the separative markers are much more common than cumu-
lative markers: subtracting the 75 of 162 languages that are listed as not having case
(English being one of them), we are left with a total of 87, of which 71 (81.6%) have
separative markers and the remaining 16 (18.4%) have cumulative markers.
5.2.3	 	 Flexitivity
Languages also differ in how much allomorphy they have, termed flexitivity in Bickel
& Nichols (2007). The Indo-European declension and conjugation classes are examples
of flexitivity, where a set of inflectional affixes are chosen depending on which class the
noun or verb belongs to. If, on the other hand, a given grammatical marker is always
the same, i.e. does not vary according to classes of verbs or nouns, it is nonflexive.
For instance, if a language has five different ways of marking the (nominative) plural,
with â•‚e, â•‚er, â•‚(e)n â•‚s, or â•‚Ø, depending on which class the noun belongs to, we have an
instance of flexitivity. This is the pattern exhibited in German. If, however, the plural
is always marked the same way, as is the case with Pichi (Creole (English-lexified):
Equatorial Guinea) dɛ̀n (Yakpo 2009), we have an instance of nonflexitivity. Again it
is important to keep in mind that we are dealing with individual morphological pro-
cesses in languages, not making statements about the sum of the possible processes in
any given language.
This is a third and separate parameter from fusion and exponence and may inter-
act with them in various ways. The German example above is an example of flexive
cumulative morphemes, because (i) the choice of which allomorph to take depends
on which declension class the noun belongs to (flexitivity) and (ii) the markers express
both number and case (cumulative). An example of a nonflexive cumulative marker is
67.	 These are Bororo (Macro-Ge (Bororo): Brazil), Maybrat (West Papuan (North Central Bird’s
Head): Indonesia), Sango and Tiwi (Australian (Tiwian): Australia).
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 107
the Hawai‘i Creole English wɛn which expresses both tense (past) and aspect (perfec-
tive) at the same time (Velupillai 2003), i.e. it is cumulative. It is invariant, which makes
it nonflexive. The plural marker in Pichi, however, is an example of an nonflexive sepa-
rative marker because (i) it is invariant as the plural marker (nonflexive) and (ii) means
only plural and nothing else (separative). An example of a flexive separative marker
can be found in Warlpiri (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia), where the ergative
case is marked either with â•‚ngku or with â•‚rlu (Bickel & Nichols 2007:â•›185). It is flexive
in that there are two alternative ways of marking ergative case, and it is separative in
that it means only one thing (ergative). The four logical combinations are summarized
in Table 5.2 with the languages exemplifying each type included.
Table 5.2â•‡ The four logical combinations of flexion and exponence
with the languages from which representative examples are given in the text.
Flexive Nonflexive
Cumulative German Hawai‘i Creole English
Separative Warlpiri Pichi
Likewise, flexitivity interacts with fusion. The German plural marking mentioned above
is both flexive and concatenative; this is, in fact, the most common combination (Bickel
& Nichols 2007:â•›186). Flexive nonlinear strategies are common in Semitic languages;
we have seen that Hebrew expresses tense, mood and voice through a set of vocalisms.
However, this set differs depending on which conjugation class the verb belongs to.
Thus we had a-a for past, yi-Ø-o for future and a-e for imperative with the verbal root
g-d-r ‘to enclose’ (Example (46)). For a different conjugation, such as the root k-p-l ‘to
fold’, we have the vocalisms i-e for past (kipel), ye-a-e for future (yekapel) and a-e for
imperative (kapel). Flexive isolating markers are very rare (Bickel & Nichols 2007:â•›186),
but can be found in Sierra Otomí, where person and tense is marked by a free mor-
pheme which looks different depending on what conjugation class the verb belongs to:
		 Sierra Otomí (Oto-Manguean (Otomian): Mexico)
	 (47)	 1sg.pres	 verb	 conjugation class
		 dí	 pɛ̌ʔtsʔi ‘I keep (it)’	 I
		 dín	 tófo ‘I say (it)’	 II
		 dídí	 hóqui ‘I fix (it)’	 III
		 dídím	 pɛ̀pfi ‘I work’	 IV  (Echegoyen 1979:â•›98ff)
The Pichi plural marking mentioned above is an example of a nonflexive isolating
marker. This is pretty typical: “[n]onflexive formatives are often isolating; and the
most common type of isolating formative is nonflexive” (Bickel & Nichols 2007:
187). Turkish is an example of a language where the plural marker â•‚lar is nonflexive
108	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
concatenativeÂ�
 – also a very common strategy – as it attaches to a host but is seg-
mentable, and is invariable, i.e. is used for all nouns (Kornfilt 2003:â•›265). An example
of a nonflexive non-linear marker is the perfective marker in Kisi, invariably expressed
through a LH tone (Childs 1995:â•›173). The six logical combinations are summarized in
Table 5.3 with the languages exemplifying each type included.
Table 5.3â•‡ The six logical combinations of flexion and fusion with the languages
from which representative examples are given in the text.
Isolating Concatenative Non-linear
Flexive Sierra Otomí German Hebrew
Nonflexive Pichi Turkish Kisi
The above sections have shown that there is much more to morphological typology
than the traditional scale ranging from isolating to introflexive languages given in (27)
can capture. What we have seen is that languages employ different strategies, and that
these strategies themselves fall along three separate parameters that all interact with
each other.
5.2.4	 	 Synthesis
Yet another parameter is that of synthesis, which, very simplified, can be thought of as
a scale indicating how much accumulated information a word can hold, as opposed to
the parameters given above, which, again very simplified, basically denote what kinds
of morphemes languages tend to have and how they combine. But bear in mind that
I am simplifying matters considerably by merging the concepts of phonological word
and grammatical word. For a thorough overview of word formation typology, see
Aikhenvald (2007) and Dixon & Aikhenvald (2002).
There are three basic types of synthesis, which can be pictured as standing in a
linear arrangement to each other:
	 (48)	 analytic	 >	 synthetic	 >	 polysynthetic
It is important here to keep in mind that this is a continuous scale and that there are
no sharp boundaries between the three types. Again, bear in mind that we are dealing
with morphological processes in languages, not whole language typologies. English,
for instance, makes use of both analytic and synthetic constructions.
Analytic words do not take any affixation to their lexical roots or stems. An ana-
lytic way (also called periphrastic) of marking tense, for example, is found in the
English future, as in He will walk home. Synthetic words allow affixation. An example
of synthetic tense in English is the past, expressed through the â•‚ed affixation, as in He
walked home. English typically does not take a high amount of affixation. For instance,
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 109
while the grammatical coding of comparative (“more”) for adjectives tends to be done
synthetically if the stem is rather short, an analytic construction is favoured if the stem
is rather long. Compare strong – stong-er or steady – steadi-er (synthetic) with beauti-
ful – more beautiful or helpful – more helpful (analytic). The Chichewa Example (29)
above also shows instances of synthetic words, where several pieces of grammatical
information are attached to the lexical root or stem. But a synthetic word can also end
up being very long. A spectacular case of synthesis can be found in Turkish:
		 Turkish (Altaic (Turkic): Turkey)
	 (49)	 tanıştırılamadıklarındandır
		 tan-ış-tır-ıl-a-ma-dık-lar-ın-dan-dır
		 know-recip-caus-pass-pot-neg-nzr-pl-3.poss-abl-3.cop
		 ‘It is because they cannot be introduced to each other.’
		 (lit. ‘(it) is from their not being able to be made known to each other’)
 (Bickel & Nichols 2007:â•›191)
The crucial difference between synthetic and polysynthetic words is that the latter
involve more than one lexeme.68 While the Turkish example in (49) is very long and
involves a great deal of segments, there is only one lexeme, tan ‘know’. Polysynthetic
words, however, may contain more than one lexeme. Alutor is an example of a lan-
guage with polysynthetic words. Consider the second word in (50):
		 Alutor (Chukotko-Kamchatkan (Northern Chukotko-Kamchatkan): Russia)
	 (50)	 gəmmə	 takkannalgənkuwwatavətkən
		 gəmmə	 t-akka-n-nalgə-n-kuww-at-avə-tk-ən
		 1.abs	 1sg.s-son-caus-skin-caus-dry-suff-suff-pres-1sg.s
		 ‘I am making a son dry a skin/skins.’  (Gerdts 1998:â•›87)
The Turkish word tanıştırılamadıklarındandır in (49) is as long as the Alutor word
takkannalgənkuwwatavətkən in (50) but the Turkish word is synthetic while the Alutor
word is polysynthetic. This is because the Alutor word contains three different lexemes,
akka ‘son’, nalgə ‘skin’ and kuww ‘dry’ (bolded in the example). Although polysynthetic
words tend to be long, they do not necessarily have to be, as (51) shows.
68.	 This is, in fact, to simplify matters a great deal. There is no one single defining feature that makes
one language polysynthetic and another not; rather, languages fall on a continuum with those that
are more or less synthetic cluster at one end and those that are very synthetic indeed at the other.
However, typically polysynthetic languages tend to have certain features, such as, among others, a
very large inventory of bound morphemes, incorporation (see 6.1.2 below), and the possibility to
express entire sentences as one phonological word. See further Aikhenvald (2007:â•›5f).
110	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Mamaindê (Nambikuaran (Nambikuaran): Brazil)
	 (51)	 jukhoʔthĩntu
		 ju-khoʔ-thĩn-tu
		 edge-hang-ncl.village-fns
		 ‘village hanging on the edge’  (Eberhard 2009:â•›349)
The Mamaindê word jukhoʔthĩntu is shorter than the Turkish word tanıştırılaÂ�
madıÂ�
klarındandır, but is still a case of polysynthesis, since it contains two lexemes, ju ‘edge’
and khoʔ ‘hang’ (bolded in the example).
5.3	 Sign language morphology
Sign languages, just like spoken languages, have minimal meaningful units, i.e. mor-
phemes, and instances where units may alternate, i.e. allomorphy. Morphemes may
be either free, i.e. function on their own, or bound, i.e. be dependent on a host, and
they may combine, for example to form compounds or derivations. In other words,
signed languages are as linguistically complex as spoken languages. However, due to
the fact that sign languages make use of an entirely different mode of communication,
visual instead of audio, morphology in sign language tends to be less concatenative
than in spoken languages (Janzen 2007). While spoken languages are dependent on
the rather sequential nature of the production (and perception) of sound, signed lan-
guages have to their disposal a visual area comprising the whole upper body of the
signer as well as the space around the signer. The full potential of this area is made
use of, so that expressions involve not only the actual manual articulation of signs, but
also various modifications. Thus grammatical and/or derivational information may be
expressed simultaneously, for instance through facial gestures and spatial locations, so-
called non-manual markers. In a sense that makes signed languages 3-dimensional as
opposed to the 2-dimensional characteristics of spoken languages. What this amounts
to is a predominantly non-linear type of morphology (Aronoff et al. 2004), although,
as we shall see, sequentiality also occurs, both as affixation and as cliticization.
Compounding, which is also sequential in nature, is very common in sign lan-
guages (Sandler 2006). An example of a compound is the ASL sign for faint which
consists of the signs mindâ•›+â•›drop (ibid: 330). An example of a derivation is the
ISL negative suffix, which, similar to the English â•‚less, derives adjectives, for instance
shameless in the construction shameâ•›+â•›neg69. This negative suffix has two allo-
morphs, signed either with one hand or two, depending on the host it attaches to (Meir
69.	 Although it originally grammaticalized from the sign NOT-EXIST, it is now a reduced and
bound form of that sign. For the sake of distinguishing between the full sign NOT-EXIST and the
negator, I am glossing the negator neg. For more on grammaticalization in sign languages, see 13.3.
	 Chapter 5.â•‡ Morphology	 111
2004:â•›115ff). Examples of prefixes are the ISL ‘sense’ prefixes: to denote that something
has to do with perception (seeing/hearing/smelling (intuiting)) a reduced and bound
form of the sign for the relevant perceptory organ is prefixed to the host, for example,
EYE-SHARP ‘to discern by seeing’ (Aronoff et al. 2003:â•›61).
Examples of cliticized forms occur in Turkish Sign Language (TİD: Turkey) and
DGS. In TİD the negator NOT may attach itself to the preceding sign and form part of
a phonological unit with that host: it (en)cliticizes. This reduced form differs from an
affix in the same way as a spoken clitic differs from an affix: the clitic is not syntactically
dependent on the host, but simply attaches to whatever precedes it. It also has a free
counterpart (Zeshan 2004a:â•›46). Another example of a clitic is the DGS deictic there
which may either occur as a free sign of form part of a single sign unit (Zeshan 2002:â•›166).
Non-linear morphological processes are very common in sign languages. For
example, verbs are very often modified non-linearly for agreement with the subject
and object or for aspect (Aronoff et al. 2003). What is non-linear about much of sign
language morphology is that the base of the sign, the stem, is modified as to its rhythm,
path or direction to indicate the relevant grammatical information. For instance, many
verbs (so-called ‘agreeing verbs’ or ‘directional verbs’) are marked for subject and
object by modifying the location-movement-location base of the stem so that loca-
tion1 is at the subject and location2 at the object. At the same time, the palm orienta-
tion is towards the object. By having the movement component of the sign making
an arch the sign has further been specified for durational aspect. All this grammatical
information is expressed by taking the basic form of the stem and modifying it during
the signing. In a sense this is similar to the root-and-pattern of Semitic verb forms
described above, except for the fact that the Semitic root is a bound morpheme – it
cannot function on its own without modification – while the sign is a free morpheme.
It seems as if sign languages universally make use of what has been termed classi-
fiers (Aronoff et al. 2003:â•›63). They modify verbs and typically decode (i) the shape of
objects, (ii) the handling of an object and (iii) the movement and location of referents.
With classifiers, “the handshape of one or both hands represents a particular type of
referent, while the location, arrangement and movement of the hand expresses some-
thing about the referent” (Zeshan 2002:â•›171). These classifiers are organized paradig-
matically. An example of a complex sign using classifiers would be Figure 5.1 expressing
the sentence The car hits a tree (and gets wrecked) in ASL. Here the non-dominant hand
is configured for the classifier “tree” (the forearm upright, palm outwards) while the
dominant hand is configured for “vehicle” (the hand has the thumb, index finger and
middle finger stretched out while the ring finger and pinkie are bent), signs “move”
(by moving the hand towards the non-dominant hand) and adds the configurations
for “wrecked” at the end of the motion (index and middle finger bend).
There are two major types of classifiers, entity classifiers (encoding the referent)
and handling classifiers (encoding how the referent is manoeuvred). Sign languages
112	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
vary in the amount of classifiers they have. For example, NGT has 17 classifier hand-
shapes (Zwitserlood 2003:â•›138ff) while Indo-Pakistani Sign Language (IPSL: India,
Pakistan) only has two, “legs” and “person” (Zeshan 2003b:â•›118).
Many sign languages make use of reduplication to express the general concept of
“more of the same”, similarly as in spoken languages. Sign reduplication is, for example,
done by having the sign make an arch and thereby repeating the location-movement-
location pattern in one fluid motion (which makes it an instance of a single reduplicated
unit, not several repeated units). A reduplicated verb will typically indicate a longer dura-
tion of the event (durative), or that it occurs habitually (habitual), or that it occurs repeat-
edly (iterative). A reduplicated noun typically indicates plurality (Perniss et al. 2007:â•›9).
	 5.4	 Summary
Both spoken and signed languages make use of morphemes, small units which carry information
of some kind.These units can be either bound or free.The core of a lexeme is a root or a stem, the
difference between the two being that the root is not further analysable into any smaller parts,
while a stem may consist of a root plus something else. Affixes are bound morphemes that do
not carry any lexemic information and that are syntactically dependent on what kind of host they
may attach to. Clitics are also bound morphemes, but while they are phonologically dependent
on a host, they are not syntactically dependent on what they may attach to. Both affixes and
clitics can attach at different places on their hosts.
The traditional way of classifying languages into one of three (or possibly four) types of
fusional categories obscures the fact that morphological processes make use of three different
parameters. Fusion indicates how tightly morphemes attach to each other. Reduplication is a
kind of fusion. Exponence indicates how much information each morpheme conveys. Flexion
denotes how much allomorphy a language has. A separate, fourth, parameter is that of synthesis,
which denotes how much information, both grammatical and lexemic, a word may carry.

Sign languages are as morphologically complex as spoken languages, but due to their dif-
ference in modality – spoken languages being dependent on the sequential nature of sound
while signed languages have at their disposal the simultaneity of the visual medium – spoken
languages are predominantly linear in their morphological processes while signed languages
are predominantly non-linear.

The lexicon and its classes
In all known languages, both spoken and signed, the vocabulary of an individual
language can be grouped into open and closed word classes. Open word classes are
typically lexical classes (also called lexical categories or content words) and are those
where words can easily be added, for instance through derivation or other ways of
forming new words, or through borrowing. Closed word classes are typically func-
tional classes (also called functional categories or function words) and are those
where words are not readily added; while there is change in these classes too, the
change is much slower than with open classes. This chapter first gives a brief sketch
of how spoken languages form new words (6.1), then moves on to give an overview
of how languages tend to classify their words (6.2). I will give brief definitions of the
various word class categories and show that some word classes are universal while most
are not. Section 6.3 gives an overview of parts-of-speech in sign languages.
6.1	 Word-formation
The following will give a brief overview of word-formation, i.e. how languages create
new words for their open classes. It is by no means an exhaustive discussion of the vari-
ous issues related to the topic. For very accessible overviews on word-formation, see, for
example, Bauer (2003) and Booij (2005). For more detailed information, see Matthews
(2006) and Aikhenvald (2007) as well as Chapters 80–93 in Booij et al. (2000).
There are two main ways for languages to form new lexemes: derivation and com-
pounding. Compounding basically involves amalgamations of lexemes to form a new
lexeme, whereas derivation relies on modifying a lexeme through various morphologi-
cal processes to form a new lexeme. An example of a compound is windmill, formed
with the lexemes wind + mill. An example of a derivation is healthy, formed with
the lexeme health and the affix â•‚y. Compounding and derivation are not mutually
exclusive. For instance, football is a compound (foot + ball) and from that we have
the derivation footballer (football-er).
116	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
6.1.1	 	 Derivation
Derivational morphology is different from inflectional morphology in that, very gen-
erally speaking, inflection carries grammatical information such as number, case and
gender, while derivation does not. Derivation only serves to create new words; these
new words may then take necessary inflectional morphology. For example, from trap
we may derive the word entrapment, using the prefix enâ•‚ and the suffix â•‚ment. We
may then inflect this derived word for plural, entrapments (entrapment + plural â•‚s).
Furthermore, while derivations may change the word class, for instance making a noun
out of verb (such as sing-er from sing), or an adjective out of a noun (such as health-y
from health), and so on, inflection never affects the word class. Also, inflection tends
to be obligatory while derivation is not. For instance, in English the plural has to be
marked through one of the plural allomorphs if the entities referred to consist of more
than one, or the construction would be ungrammatical. However, deriving a new word
using a derivational strategy is an optional choice. There are several other distinguish-
ing features between inflection and derivation; for a thorough listing on the typical
differences between the two, see Aikhenvald (2007:â•›36).
There are many different ways in which languages can form new words through
derivation, and any one language may employ several strategies. A common deriva-
tional device is affixing (see 5.1 for different types of affixes). Another very common
derivational device is reduplication (see 5.2.1.4 for examples). Apophony (also called
stem mutation, Beard 1998:â•›62) involves internal modification of the stem, for example
ablaut (see 5.2.1.3). An example of an English apophony derivation involving both a
vowel and a consonant change is breach /bɹi:ʧ/ from break /bɹeik/ (Aikhenvald 2007:
45). Prosodic modification through stress or tone is another derivational device, for
instance in English, where the difference between ˈpermit (noun) and perˈmit (verb) is
only one of stress (see 4.2.3 for further examples).
Less common are devices which involve removing something. With subtraction a
predictable part of the word is removed. An example can be found in French, where the
masculine counterpart of the feminine adjective form is predictably shorter, namely
lacking the final consonant: compare petite /pətit/ ‘little.f’ versus petit /pəti/ ‘little.m’
and verte /vɛʁt/ ‘green.f’ versus vert /vɛʁ/ ‘green.m’ (Bauer 2003:â•›39). Other kinds of
shortenings are truncation, clipping and back-formation. An example of a clipping
is pram from perambulator or phone from telephone. While clippings tend to mean
the same thing as their longer counterparts, truncations do not, as in evacuee from
evacuate. One way of thinking of truncations is that the suffix â•‚ate is cut off (truncated)
before the suffix â•‚ee is added to evacuâ•‚ (see e.g. Bauer 2004). Another way of seeing it
is that the suffixes â•‚ate and â•‚ee are substituted (see e.g. Watson 1976). A back-formation
is when a part of a word which seems to be an affix (but might not be) is deleted. An
example is baby-sit from baby-sitter where â•‚er is conceived of as a suffix parallel to
the suffix in singer and runner. A blend involves merging two words that get partly
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 117
Â�
truncated, as in smog which consists of the beginning of smoke and the end of fog, or
motel which consists of the beginning of motor and the end of hotel.
Conversion (also called zero-derivation) is when a word changes word class with-
out any modification to the word itself. An example of a conversion would be bottle,
which in isolation is intuitively classed as a noun, but which by conversion can be used
as a verb, for instance in To bottle wine. Another example is walk, which in isolation
intuitively would be classed as a verb, but which by conversion also may function as a
noun, as in To take a walk.
6.1.2	 	 Compounding
A very common strategy for languages to form new lexemes is through compounding.
It is important to note here that a compound is not just two separate words that hap-
pen to come next to each other, but that it actually constitutes its own phonological
unit. This holds true irrespective of how the compound is spelled, as it is the pronun-
ciation that is relevant. In English, for example, compounds may either be written
as one word, such as football (a kind of ball, also a kind of sport where that ball is
used), or with a hyphen, such as pie-eyed (drunk), or as two separate words, such as
fire door (a kind of door that prevents fire from spreading further); cf. also the Lango
example below. The crucial thing about all these words is that they are pronounced
as one phonological unit, for instance they all have only one primary stress: football
/ˈfʊtbɔ:l/, pie-eyed /ˈpaɪaɪd/, fire door /ˈfaɪədɔ(ɹ)/. There are, however, exceptions to this
general rule. Pacoh (Austro-Asiatic (Katuic): Vietnam) compounds, for example, may
consist of phonologically free words but still function as one single lexeme, as in aât
acheq ‘wilderness’ (animal + bird) (Watson 1976:â•›226). Compounds are also typically
inflected only once, as one word, according to its head (main) lexeme. If we talk about
two black-and-white balls played by two opposing teams on a rectangular field with a
goal at each end, we would inflect for plural only once for the entire compound and
say footballs (not *feetballs). Likewise, if we are talking about two fire resistant doors we
would again only inflect for plural once for the entire compound, fire doors (not *fires
doors). Notice, again, that we are dealing with general patterns. For instance, even in
English this pattern does not always hold: with the compound tooth mark both parts
of the compound are inflected for the plural to teeth marks. Compounds typically do
not get broken up by, for example, modifiers. We may talk about a new football or a
metal fire door, but we cannot say *a footnewball or *a fire metal door. I stress again
that while these are general tendencies, it should be kept in mind that none of these
criteria are absolute universals, as the examples above have shown.
Languages may have different kinds of compounds. Root compounds (or pri-
mary compounds) typically centre on nouns one way or another. An endocentric
compound (also called a tatpuruṣa compound from Sanskrit tatpuruṣa ‘that-person’)
refers to “a sub-class of the items denoted by one of [the] elements” (Bauer 2003:â•›42).
118	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
An example of an endocentric compound in English would be blackbird (black +
bird), which is a type of bird. Likewise, the Maori compound wharenui ‘meeting
house’ (whare ‘house’ + nui ‘big’) is a type of house (Harlow 2007:â•›130). In both of
these cases the compound is a sub-category of its head element. That is, the head ele-
ment in blackbird is bird (it’s a type of bird), and the head element in whárenui is wháre
(it’s a type of house). An exocentric compound (also called a bahuvrihi compound
from Sanskrit bahuvrihi ‘having much rice’), on the other hand, is not a sub-class of
any of the compounded elements. An example of an exocentric compound in English
would be the above mentioned pie-eyed, which is neither a type of pie nor a type of
eye. In Lango the compound wàŋ ɔ̀t ‘window’ (wàŋ ‘eye’ + ɔ̀t ‘house’) is neither a type
of eye nor a type of house (Noonan 1992:â•›115). A Maori ihupuku (ihu ‘nose’ + puku
‘swollen’) is neither a type of nose nor a type of swollen but is a sea elephant (Harlow
2007:â•›130). A copulative or coordinate compound (also called a dvandva compound
from Sanskrit dvandva ‘two-and-two’) refers to “an entity made up of the two elements
mentioned in the compound together” (Bauer 2003:â•›43). An example of a copulative
compound in English would be bitter-sweet, denoting a taste (or feeling) which is
both bitter and sweet. The word pesa-t�aka ‘money’ in Malto (Dravidian (Northern
Dravidian): India) is a copulative compound meaning the sum of its two parts pesa
‘coin, paisa’ and t�aka ‘bank-note, rupee’ (Steever 1998:â•›384).
In syntactic compounds (sometimes also called verbal compounds70) the head
element is a verb and the modifying element is something which could have func-
tioned as that verb’s argument in a phrase. An example in English would be hair-dryer,
where the head is the verb dry and the modifying element hair could have functioned
as an object to the verb: to dry hair. An example in Russian would be sneg-o-pad
‘snowfall’ (sneg ‘snow’ + o ‘linker’ + pad ‘falling’; Aikhenvald 2007:â•›32), where, just as
in English, the head verb could have had the modifying noun as a subject: snow falls.
A special kind of syntactic compound is incorporation, which will be further
discussed in Chapter 9. There is a large body of literature discussing the exact nature
and properties of incorporation, most of it focussing on noun incorporation. For a
very accessible overview of the major issues and theories concerned with noun incor-
poration, see Massam (2009). For more details, see, for example, Baker (1988), Gerdts
(1998) and Aikhenvald (2007) as well as the highly influential studies by Mithun (e.g.
1984 and subsequent).71 What makes incorporation a special type of compounding,
70.	But see Aikhenvald (2007) where ‘verbal compound’ means root serialization. Verb serialization
will be discussed in Chapter 11.
71.	 Notice, however, that Baker (1988) and Massam (2009) include constructions as noun incorpora-
tions that, for example Aikhenvald (2007) and Gerdts (1998) do not, such as the denominal verbs of
West Greenlandic. I will essentially be following the analyses of Aikhenvald (2007) and Gerdts (1998).
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 119
and a much discussed phenomenon, is that it involves not only the word-formation
process of combining two lexemes, but also involves a host of other processes, both
morphological and syntactic.
In some ways, N[oun] I[ncorporation] is the most nearly syntactic of all morphologi-
cal processes. It combines constituents, namely N[oun]s and V[erbs]s, that are usu-
ally associated syntactically. It can be vastly more productive than other derivational
processes, like nominalization or causativization, since it combines two potentially
open sets of morphemes, N and V stems, instead of one set of stems and a limited set
of affixes. (Mithun 1984:â•›889)
Very simplified, what happens is that the head, which is usually a verb, but can also
be a preposition (Gerdts 1998:â•›84) absorbs a modifier, usually either a noun, pronoun
or adverb, which may function as a syntactic argument (for example object) to that
head. The head, however, stays in the same word class, and still functions as a verb (or
preposition, as the case may be) in every respect, needing the same kind of grammatical
markers, for instance for tense, person, number, and so on, as any other verb. In other
words, the verb absorbs (incorporates) part of the phrase to form a complex verbal stem,
which is then inflected as any other verbal stem. The incorporated element basically
becomes part of the verb. This in essence has various grammatical effects, for instance
with respect to syntax (especially valency) and discourse (especially information flow).
These grammatical domains will be discussed in more detail in Sections 9.1.2 and 9.2.
The most common type of incorporation is a noun incorporated into a verb, noun
incorporation. An example of noun incorporation can be found in Yucatec:
		 Yucatec (Mayan (Mayan): Mexico)
	 (52)	 a.	 t-in-p’oʔ-Ø-ah	 nòok
			 compl-1sg-wash-it-perf	 clothes
			 ‘I washed (the) clothes.’
		 b.	 p’oʔ-nòok-n-ah-en
			 wash-clothes-antipass-pfv-1sg.abs
			 ‘I clothes-washed.’ (= ‘I washed clothes.’)  (Bricker 1978:â•›15)
In (52a) the noun nòok ‘clothes’ stands alone as an object to the verb p’oʔ ‘wash’. In
(52b), however, that noun has been absorbed (incorporated) into the verb. Without
going into too many details at this point, essentially, the result of the incorporation
in Yucatec refers to “a unitary activity, in which the N[oun] modifies the type of
activity predicated, but does not refer to a specific entity” (Mithun 1984:â•›857). That
is, while in (52a) specific clothes are referred to (for example I washed the clothes
you put on the floor (but not those that were still in your bag)) in (52b) there is no
specific entity referred to, rather just a general action (for example I washed clothes
all day yesterday).
120	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Notice that it doesn’t necessarily have to be the full form of the noun that gets
incorporated. Compare (53a and b) from Huasteca Nahuatl, where the incorporated
noun is the stem form of the full, free noun.
		 Huasteca Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan (Aztecan). Mexico)
	 (53)	 a.	 aškėman	 ti-ʔ-kwa	 nakatl
			 never	 2sg-it-eat	 meat
			 ‘You never eat meat.’
		 b.	 naʔ	 ipanima	 ni-naka-kwa
			 1sg	 always	 1sg-meat-eat
			 ‘I eat meat all the time.’ (lit. ‘I always meat-eat.’)  (Merlan 1976:â•›185)
Noun incorporation might seem a highly exotic phenomenon, but Map 6.1 shows that
it is found in quite a number of languages. As can be seen from the map, noun incor-
poration is especially common on the American continent, both North and South.
Map 6.1â•‡ Examples of languages with noun incorporation. This is not an exhaustive
survey. For a full legend, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/z.176.additional.
While it is rare, adpositions may also be incorporated. An example of a postposition
incorporation can be found in Nadëb:
		 Nadëb (Nadahup (Nadahup): Brazil)
	 (54)	 a.	 ɛɛS	 a-hɨng	 hxɔɔh	 go
			 father	 formative72-go.downriver	 canoe	 in
			 ‘Father goes downriver in a canoe.’
72.	 In Nadëb the verbal root is bound and needs some prefix to form a stem. The ‘formative prefix’
is used to form a verbal stem if there are no other prefixes attached to the verbal root.
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 121
		 b.	 hxɔɔhO	 ɛɛA	 ga-hɨng
			 canoe	 father	 in-go.downriver
			 ‘Father goes downriver in a canoe.’ (lit. ‘Father goes-downriver-in (a) canoe.’)
 (Martins & Martins 1999:â•›262)
The postposition go ‘in’ in (54) has been incorporated into the verb hɨng ‘go-downriver’
in (54) to form gahɨng ‘go.downriver.in’ (I am ignoring the assimilation process of go to
ga here). The effect here is that the object (hxɔɔh ‘canoe’) gets emphasized.73
Because of the difficulty in distinguishing it from cliticization, it is beyond the
scope of this book to discuss pronoun incorporation. Basically, a clitic simply attaches
to its host, while pronoun incorporation creates a new lexeme. A kind of example
that might serve as an illustration is the difference in English between bathe and bask,
where the latter verb (bask) is the result of a fusion of the Old Norse (Indo-European
(Germanic): present-day Scandinavia) reflexive pronoun sik ‘self’ with the verb baða
‘bathe’ which led to the new lexeme bask.
Chukchi (Chukotko-Kamchatkan (Northern Chukotko-Kamchatkan): Russia)
offers an example of how adjectives may get incorporated into nouns, as in nilgəqin
quoraŋə ‘(a) white reindeer’ (abs.sg) versus elgəquorata ‘(by a) white.reindeer’ (erg.sg)
(Muravyova 1998:â•›527).
6.2	 Parts-of-speech
In the previous section, as well as previous chapters, such terms as noun, verb, adjec-
tive, adverb, adposition and pronoun have occurred in abundance. But what exactly do
they mean? Well, they are different parts-of-speech (or word classes), which in essence
are major categories of words that group together grammatically. This section will give
a brief and very simplified overview of the four lexical class parts-of-speech that may
occur in a language, as well as some typical functional class parts-of-speech found
in the languages of the world. For very concise overviews on word classes, see Evans
(2000), Haspelmath (2001) and Anward (2006). For more details and discussion, see,
for example, Givón (2001a:â•›49ff) and Schachter & Shopen (2007). For a somewhat
different approach to lexical classes, see, for example, Baker (2004), Rijkhoff (2007),
Hengeveld & van Lier (2010). It would be beyond the scope of this section to give an
exhaustive list of all the functional parts-of-speech we know about; for more details,
see Schachter & Shopen (2007), which this section relies heavily on.
73.	 In actuality it is a case of manipulating the valency of the verb, which then affects which word(s)
will function as obligatory objects. This in turn influences certain discourse properties, such as what
element gets focussed on, and so on. See further Section 9.2.
122	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Languages differ radically in how many classes they have and in the proportions
of these classes. Some languages have an extremely limited set of closed class words
(or functional categories), while others have a high number of such words. Some lan-
guages have only two open word classes (or lexical categories), others, like English,
have as many as four separate such classes. Furthermore, a word class found in one
language will not necessarily be found in another language. In other words, while it
seems to be universal that languages actually do group their words into categories of
some kind, the categories themselves are language independent.
6.2.1	 	 Lexical classes
As mentioned above, it seems that all known languages distinguish between open and
closed classes. The open classes typically consist of content words, i.e. words with more
or less concrete, specific meanings. Languages may have up to four major open class
parts-of-speech, nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. The definitions of these catego-
ries rely on a cluster of features, both semantic (denoting meaning), grammatical and
syntactic (how items are combined).
Each of the above-mentioned categories may contain further subcategories.
In English, for example, nouns can be subcategorized into mass and count nouns,
depending on whether they can take the plural (e.g. sand/*sands versus chair/chairs);
or proper and common nouns, depending on whether they can take the article (e.g.
Peter/*the Peter versus chair/the chair), or abstract versus concrete (e.g. emotion ver-
sus chair), and so on. Other languages subcategorize depending on whether or not
the item is possessable. In Maasai, for example, nouns are either possessable or non-
possessable. Such things as tools, money, houses, kin, and so on can be marked for
possession grammatically, but such things as meat, water, land and stars cannot (or
if they are marked for possession it sounds very odd to the speakers). So while it is
acceptable to mark ɛnkɛ́rái ‘child’ for possession, ɛnkɛ́ráy áy ‘my child’, it is not read-
ily acceptable to mark ɛnkɔ́p ‘land, dirt’ for possession, ??ɛnkɔ́p áy ‘my land’ (Payne
1997:â•›40). Yet other languages, for instance Mamaindê, subcategorize their nouns
depending on, among other things, physical properties such as consistency (whether
the item in question is solid or liquid) and shape (Eberhard 2009). In other words,
the potential subcategorizations of each major part-of-speech category are language
dependent.
It is important to keep in mind that the defining characteristics given for each
part-of-speech category should not be seen as absolute, but as general indications of
features that typically cluster together in a given word class.
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 123
6.2.1.1	 Nouns
The first major open part-of-speech category, noun, typically refers to things, per-
sons and places, but also includes abstract notions such as feelings, ideas and so on.
Grammatically, nouns may typically be marked for number (how many of the item(s)
are being referred to), case (what role the item has in the sentence), gender (what sub-
category the item belongs to) and definiteness (whether it is a specific entity referred
to or not), for instance through morphological processes, but also, especially in the
case of languages with predominantly analytic strategies, through syntactic processes.
Nouns may also combine with demonstrative pronouns (e.g. this/that as in this/that
house) and may function as arguments (that is, participants, e.g. subject and object) in
a clause. For an article-length overview of the noun, see Lehmann & Moravcsik (2000).
English has two numbers, singular (one entity) and plural (more than one of the
same entity), as in chair versus chairs. Other languages, such as Lavukaleve, specify
for dual (two of the same entity), as in funfun ‘firefly’ (singular) – funfunil ‘(two) fire-
flies’ (dual) – funfunaul ‘fireflies’ (plural) (Terrill 1999:â•›97). For the number values trial
(three of the same entity) and paucal (a few of the same entity) see 7.1.1.1.
While English hardly has any case marking at all, the exception being the genitive
’s as in chair’s, many languages do mark for case. An example of a language that marks
its nouns for case is Dime (Afro-Asiatic (South Omotic): Ethiopia): compare zití ‘ox’
(nominative case) with zitím ‘ox’ (accusative case) (Seyoum 2008). For more on case
systems, see 7.1.3.
Gender refers to which subclass the noun belongs to. In French, for example,
nouns are either masculine (le cadeau ‘the gift’) or feminine (la table ‘the table’), while
in German they are either masculine (der Stuhl ‘the chair’), feminine (die Mütze ‘the
hat, cap’) or neuter (das Buch ‘the book’). Swedish also has two genders, but unlike
French they are not masculine or feminine, but neuter (ett träd ‘a tree’) and “non-
neuter” or common (en bok ‘a book’). See further 7.1.2.
Definiteness indicates whether we are referring to a general example of an entity
or a specific entity, as in the difference between a man and the man.
6.2.1.2	 Verbs
The second major open part-of-speech category, verb, typically refers to actions and
processes (e.g. dance, grow, etc.), but also states (e.g. know, exist, etc.).74 Grammatically,
verbs may typically be marked for tense (placing the event in time), aspect (specifying
74.	 It is not a universal that verbs belong to an open class of words: there are languages that have
a distinct but closed class of verbs, found predominantly in Australia and Papua New Guinea.
Jaminjung (Australian (Jaminjungan): Australia) is an example of such a language, with a class of
verbs containing only 33 members (Schultze-Berndt 2000:â•›84).
124	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the perspective taken on the event), mood (indicating the speaker’s attitude toward
a situation or a statement), voice (e.g. whether an event is active or passive) and vari-
ous devices for manipulating valency (specifying how many obligatory arguments
the verb must have), as well as polarity (whether the statement is in the affirmative or
the negative). Again, as with nouns, these operations may be marked either through
morphological or syntactic processes. Verbs may also be marked for person agreement,
where a grammatical marker indicates the number (one or more) and person (first,
second or third) of an argument, most commonly the subject. Verbs typically func-
tion as predicates, typically form the core of the sentence or clause and typically have
“a relational meaning, relating one or more participants (or arguments) to an event”
(Anward 2006:â•›408). For an article-length overview of the verb, see Bybee (2000).
English has three tenses, two of which are marked morphologically and one that
is marked syntactically. The present tense (placing the event in the present, the ‘now’)
is marked with a suffix â•‚s for third person singular, as in He walks. The past tense
(placing the event in the past) is also marked morphologically, most commonly with
a suffixed â•‚ed (for the moment I will ignore other means of marking the past tense in
English), as in He walked. The future tense (placing the event in the future) is marked
analytically with the use of an auxiliary verb (see below), as in He will walk.75 Other
languages have other kinds of tense systems, such as only two tenses (either past
versus nonpast or future versus nonfuture), or have more than three, or none. For
more on tense, see 8.2.
It is common for languages to have some kind of aspect marking. English, for
example, marks for progressive (denoting that the event is on-going) with the suf-
fix â•‚ing, as in He is walking. Languages may also make a grammatical difference
between perfective (extremely simplified, if an event is seen as a completed whole)
and imperfective (again extremely simplified, if an event is seen as an ongoing pro-
cess). French is an example of such a language, where the difference between Il a
payé ‘he paid’ (perfective) and Il payait ‘he paid’ (imperfective) is one of aspect. See
further Section 8.4.
English typically expresses modality other than indicative (the form typically used
for declarative sentences) analytically, except for the imperative (giving commands),
which is the base form of the verb, as in Walk! Languages may mark for wishes (desid-
eratives and optatives), for prohibitions (prohibitive), for tentativeness or hypothetical
situations (subjunctive), for what kind of evidence they have for a statement (eviden-
tials), and so on. For more on mood and modality, see 8.5.
75.	 This is of course again a simplification, as there are several ways of indicating futurity in Modern
English. For example, the progressive –ing form may indicate futurity: He is coming tomorrow.
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 125
English has two voices, active and passive. An example of an active sentence is
He opened the door, which, in the passive, would be The door was opened by him. The
difference between the two is one of valency, which will be further discussed in 9.2.
Languages also mark for polarity one way or another, and often that is done in con-
nection with the verb. English contrasts affirmative and negative sentences with not,
as in He walked versus He did not walk (I am, for the moment, ignoring the obligatory
auxiliary verb for English negations). Other languages mark negation through an affix
on the verb. In Dime, for example, the negative is marked by â•‚káy: nú ʔadéén ‘he comes’
(affirmative) versus nú ʔadkay ‘he does not come’ (negative) (Seyoum 2009:â•›190). For
a discussion on the position of the negative morpheme relative to the verb surveyed
for 1326 languages, see Dryer (2011m).
The only form of person agreement that English has is the present tense third per-
son singular suffix â•‚s, as in He walks versus I walk. Other languages, however, gram-
matically indicate agreement for all three persons, and all the numbers that the language
has. In Italian, for example, the verb is inflected for three persons and two numbers:
		 Italian (Indo-European: (Romance): Italy)
	 (55)	 1sg	 mangio	 ‘I eat’
		 2sg	 mangi	 ‘you eat’
		 3sg	 mangia	 ‘he/she/it eats’
		 1pl	 mangiamo	 ‘we eat’
		 2pl	 mangiate	 ‘you eat’
		 3pl	 mangiano	 ‘they eat’  (source: personal knowledge)
Other languages may inflect for dual, and even trial and paucal, depending on their
systems. See further Section 9.1.3.5.
I stress again that none of these criteria are absolutes, but rather form a cluster of
characteristics that may serve to identify whether a given word is a noun or a verb. For
example, there are languages, such as Mwotlap, where nouns may take tense, mood
and aspect markers.
		 Mwotlap (Austronesian (Oceanic): Vanuatu)
	 (56)	 kōyō	 ma-tayak	 kē,	 tō	 kē	 ni-ēntē-yō	 togolgol
		 3du	 pfct-adopt	 3sg	 then	 3sg	 aor-child-3du	 straight
		 ‘They have adopted him, so that he (became) their legitimate son.’
 (François 2005:â•›131)
In (56) ēntē ‘child’ is marked both for tense/aspect with the aorist prefix niâ•‚ and for
agreement with the 3rd person dual subject (they-2, the two of them) with the suffix
â•‚yō, just as if it had been a verb. In Nuuchahnulth the same word may translate either
as a noun phrase or a verb phrase:
126	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Nuuchahnulth (Wakashan (Southern Wakashan): Canada)
	 (57)	 inikw-ihl-minh-‘is-it
		 fire/burn-house.loc-pl-small-past
		 ‘The little fires that were once burning in the house.’ OR
		 ‘Several small fires were burning in the house.’  (Baker 2001:â•›25f)
In (57) inikw ‘fire/burn’ may translate either as a noun (fire) or as a verb (burn),
depending on context. In other words, languages might allow a significant amount of
overlap between the characteristics of nouns and verbs. However, while the difference
between the two classes might not be as clear-cut as in English, there is still a distinc-
tion between them. For instance, in Nuuchahnulth verb stems (or verbal predicates,
to be more precise) can only function in the same contexts as nominals when modi-
fied by the enclitic article =˚iq/=ʔiˑ (m/n) (Davidson 2002:â•›91ff,â•›324ff). In Mwotlap the
tense, mood and aspect markers are obligatory for verbs, while they are only optional
for nouns (François 2005). One might think of it as a continuum on a scale between
the two ends in Figure 6.1, where on the one end of the scale there is very little overlap
between the characteristics of nouns and verbs, such as in English, and on the other
end there is a lot of – but not complete – overlap between the characteristics of nouns
and verbs, such as in Nuuchahnulth or Mwotlap. It thus seems that a distinction at
some level between two open classes, nouns and verbs, is a near-absolute universal.
N N
V V
Figure 6.1â•‡ A continuum of overlap between characteristics of nouns and verbs. Languag-
es with very little amount of overlap, such as in English, fall on the left end of the scale,
while languages with a lot of overlap, such as Nuuchahnulth, fall on the right end of the
scale. Notice, however, that even at the right-most edge of the scale there is not complete
overlap between the two.
6.2.1.3	 Adjectives
The third group of words which may constitute an open class, adjectives, typically
denotes qualities or attributes, such as colour, size, shape and so on. Adjectives typi-
cally modify nouns. Notice that this section will deal with descriptive adjectives only
and not those noun modifiers usually termed either quantitative or limiting adjectives,
such as many, some, a few and so on. These kinds of noun modifiers never constitute
an open class. Descriptive adjectives, however, may form an open class in many lan-
guages, though this is by far not universal. Grammatically adjectives may be specified
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 127
for degree (the extent to which a property holds), either morphologically or syntacti-
cally, and may combine with degree words that cannot combine with nouns or verbs.
An example of the latter in English is too: while it is possible to say that something
is too cold, constructions like *too table or *too run are not acceptable. In some lan-
guages adjectives show agreement in form with the noun they modify. In German, for
example, the adjective is marked morphologically to agree with the gender of the noun
it modifies: ein roter Stuhl (masculine) ‘a red chair’ versus eine rote Blume (feminine) ‘a
red flower’ versus ein rotes Haus (neuter) ‘a red house’. For an article-length overview
of the adjective, see Bhat & Pustet (2000).
The traditional degree modifications make a distinction between three degrees:
positive, comparative and superlative. As mentioned, degree or comparison may be
expressed either morphologically or syntactically. English is a language with both
options, where longer adjectives typically take an analytic degree modification. For
instance, the comparison tall (positive) versus taller (comparative) versus tallest
(superlative) is marked morphologically, while the comparison beautiful (positive)
versus more beautiful (comparative) versus most beautiful (superlative) is marked
analytically.
The use of adjectives (or the equivalent) falls into two groups: that of modification
of a noun or that of predication (denoting a property of the subject of a clause). An
example of the former is a big apple, while an example of the latter is The apple is big.
While nouns and verbs form near-universal open class categories, this is not the
case with adjectives. For those of us who are used to European languages, this might
seem exotic. However, it is not all that rare for languages to either have a closed class
of adjectives, or to not have a distinct word class for adjectives at all. In a pilot survey
I mapped 153 languages for adjectives, with three values: ‘open class’, ‘closed class’ and
‘no separate class’ (Map 6.2). The language sample is based on the WALS 200-sample,76
but it should be noted that at this stage it is not entirely balanced. For instance the
number of Indo-European languages is proportionally too high in comparison to,
for example, Niger-Congo or Austronesian languages. Nevertheless, as a pilot survey
it serves as a starting point and does give some indications as to possible geographic
patterns. Of the 153 languages, 66 (43.1%) have an open class for adjectives, while 30
(19.6%) have a closed class and 57 (37.3%) do not have any separate class for adjectives.
As for genealogical patterns, all of the Indo-European languages sampled have an
open adjective class, all but two (Balanta (Northern Atlantic: Senegal) and Bambara)
of the Niger-Congo languages have a closed class of adjectives, and all but one of the
Australian languages, Ilgar (Iwaidjan: Australia), lack a distinct adjective class.
76.	While not every language overlaps with those in the 200-sample, every genus does. That is, if I
did not have access to a specific language, I chose another language from the same genus.
128	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Map 6.2â•‡ Adjectives in a pilot study sample. Black dots: open class (66 languages); grey
squares: closed class (30 languages); white triangles: no separate class (57 languages).
For a full legend, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/z.176.additional.
Geographically we do seem to get some patterns. For instance, a large continuous area
spanning all of Europe, the Middle and Near East, as well as most of South Asia show
black dots. Mainland East Asia (both South and North) as well as Northern Australia
show mainly white triangles. West Africa predominantly shows grey dots. North and
South America are predominantly covered in grey or white, but notice that Meso-
America almost only displays black dots.
A language with a very small closed class of adjectives is Igbo, counting only eight
of them, as shown in Table 6.1.
Table 6.1â•‡ Igbo (Niger-Congo (Igboid): Nigeria) adjectives.
value colour dimension age
ó̧má	 ‘good’ ójíʔí	 ‘black, dark’ úkwú	 ‘large’ ó̧hú̧ʔrú̧	 ‘new’
ó̧jó̧ʔó̧	 ‘bad’ ó̧cá	 ‘white, light’ ńtá	 ‘small’ ócyè	 ‘old’
(Welmers & Welmers 1969:â•›321)
The adjectives of Igbo form a neat example of Dixon’s (1982) findings that the four
properties ‘dimension’, ‘colour’, ‘age’ and ‘value’ are those most likely to be found in a
closed class of adjectives, while other properties, such as position (high, low), human
character (kind, evil), speed (fast, slow) and physical characteristics (hard, soft) are
more likely to be expressed with either nouns or verbs in languages with a closed class
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 129
of adjectives.77 An example of a language where such properties are expressed by nouns
is Hausa, where the literal translation is ‘having X’:
		 Hausa (Afro-Asiatic (West Chadic): Nigeria)
	 (58)	 a.	 mutum	 mai	 alheri
			 person	 having	 kindness
			 ‘a kind person’
		 b.	 mutum	 mai	 doki
			 person	 having	 horse
			 ‘a person having a horse’
		 c.	 yana	 da	 alheri
			 he.is	 with	 kindness
			 ‘He is kind.’
		 d.	 yana	 da	 doki
			 he.is	 with	 horse
			 ‘He has a horse.’  (Schachter & Shopen 2007:â•›15)
In Example (58) shows how descriptive properties such as kindness (alheri) are
expressed by possession of nouns. The constructions are identical to expressing other
kinds of possession. Thus the attributive quality in Example (58a) is constructed in
the same way as the possessive in (58b), and the predicative quality in Example (58c)
is expressed in the same way as the possessive in (58d). An example of a language that
expresses adjectival notions with verbs is Bemba, where the verb is either relativized
(59a) or not (59c), depending on whether it is a structure modifying a noun or whether
it is a predicative clause.
		 Bemba (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): DR Congo)
	 (59)	 a.	 umuuntu	 ùashipa
			 person	 who.is.brave
			 ‘a brave person’
		 b.	 umuuntu	 ùalemba
			 person	 who.is.writing
			 ‘a person who is writing’
		 c.	 umuuntu	 áashipa
			 person	 is.brave
			 ‘The person is brave.’
77.	 An example of a language with a very small closed class of adjectives indeed is Toqabaqita
(Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands), which has only one dimension adjective kali/kasi (with
the plural form kaala) ‘small’. All other noun modifications are expressed with stative verbs or nouns.
See further Lichtenberk (2005).
130	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
	 (59)	 d.	 umuuntu	 áalemba
			 person	 is.writing
			 ‘The person is writing.’  (Schachter & Shopen 2007:â•›16)
In other words, while all languages have ways of describing things, not all have a special
class of words for that task, as Map 6.2 shows.78
6.2.1.4	 Adverbs
The fourth and last group of words that may form an open class, adverbs, is argu-
ably the most heterogeneous of all word classes. Basically and very simplified, adverbs
typically modify categories other than nouns. Thus adverbs may modify verbs (run
quickly), adjectives (quite happy), other adverbs (very quickly), prepositions (right
out, well within), and so on, but not nouns (*dog quickly, *quite dog, *right dog, *well
dog). Notice, however, that adverbs may modify noun phrases (constructions where
the noun is the main component), as in That was quite [a party]. Because the adverbs
form such a mixed group, five main subclasses are usually distinguished: (i) setting
adverbs of space and time (here, there, below, above; now, then, today, never); (ii) man-
ner adverbs (also called predicate adverbs; quickly, repeatedly, well, badly); (iii) degree
adverbs (very, too, extremely); (iv) linking adverbs (also called text adverbs; however,
therefore, hence, thus); (v) sentence adverbs (unfortunately, probably, maybe, frankly).
For a very detailed and accessible overview of adverbs and their characteristics, see
Quirk et al. (1985). Setting, degree and linking adverbs typically form closed subclasses
within the class of adverbs even in those languages where adverbs form an open class.
Sentence adverbs are generally rare and seem to be a characteristic of the written
languages of Europe (Haspelmath 2001). This means that the only subclass of adverbs
that is actually open is manner adverbs.
It is quite common for languages to form manner adverbs from adjectives. This
is the case in English, where adverbs are easily derived by adding â•‚ly to an adjective:
slow > slowly, beautiful > beautifully, happy > happily, and so on. As with adjectives,
languages differ in whether adverbs form an open, a closed, or no class at all. In
78.	 But see Dixon (2006a), where he puts forth the argument that just as there may be significant
but not complete overlap between nouns and verbs, the same holds for adjectives. He postulates
that even those adjectives that form subclasses of verbs or nouns actually do differ in subtle ways
from other verbs or nouns in those classes. In many languages this is indeed the case. For instance
in Lango properties are denoted by verbs. However, adjectival verbs differ from other verbs in three
respects: (i) in tone, (ii) in mood, and (iii) in the fact that some adjectival verbs have different stems
for singular and plural (Noonan 1992:â•›104). In Thai, which also lacks a special class for adjectives,
only those verbs functioning as adjectives may appear in comparative and superlative constructions
(Iwasaki & Ingkaphirom 2009:â•›10).
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 131
Modern Standard Arabic, for example, adverbs form a closed class and most adver-
bial meanings are conveyed by adjectives or nouns in the accusative case (Ryding
2005). Thus ɣadan ‘tomorrow’ is the accusative form of the noun ɣadu ‘next.day’
and sariʕan ‘swiftly’ is the accusative form of the adjective sariʕ ‘swift’ (Schachter &
Shopen 2007:â•›21).
There are also languages without any separate class for manner adverbs. In
Swedish, for example, manner adverb expressions are expressed with the adjective in
the neuter form:
		 Swedish (Indo-European (Germanic): Sweden)
	 (60)	 a.	 tåget	 är	 långsamt
			 train.def.neut	 is	 slow.neut
			 ‘The train is slow.’
		 b.	 han	 läser	 långsamt
			 he	 reads	 low.neut
			 ‘He reads slowly.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In Example (60) the adjective långsam ‘slow’ is inflected in the neuter, långsamt, to
make it agree with the neuter noun tåg ‘train’ which it modifies. In (60b) the same
word, i.e. the neuter form of the adjective, functions as a manner adverb, modifying
the verb läsa ‘read’.
Ainu has neither a special class for adjectives nor a special class for adverbs; in
both cases the stative verb is used:
		 Ainu (Isolate: Japan)
	 (61)	 a.	 pirka	 menoko
			 good	 woman
			 ‘pretty woman’
		 b.	 pirka	 inu
			 good	 listen
			 ‘listen well’
		 c.	 tunasno	 pirka
			 quick	 good
			 ‘Get well quickly!’  (Shibatani 1990:â•›80)
In Example (61a) the stative verb pirka ‘be.good’ is used as an adjective, modifying the
noun menoko ‘woman’. In (61b), however, the same word is used as an adverb, modify-
ing the verb inu ‘listen’. A stative verb may also modify another stative verb, as shown
in (61c), where the optional reading of ‘become X’ allows for the imperative reading
which would literally translate into something like “Become good fast!”.
132	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Due to the amount of overlap we have seen between various lexical classes,
Hengeveld et al. (2004) propose the following implicational hierarchy (given here in
a slightly modified version):79
	 (62)	 Verbs > Nouns > Adjectives > (Manner) Adverbs
What this hierarchy implies is that the further to the left a category is, the more likely
it is that it exists as its own lexical class in a language. It also implies that if a language
has a separate open class for nouns, then it also has a separate category for verbs, and
if a language has a separate open class for adjectives, then it also has separate open
classes for nouns and verbs. This means that the hierarchy postulates that a language
with a separate open category for adverbs necessarily has a separate open class for
adjectives. However, this hierarchy only illustrate tendencies and not universals: in
Jaminjung, for example, verbs form a closed class of words (cf. footnote 74 above) and
in Hixkaryana, adjectives have been analysed as actually belonging to the category of
adverbs (Meira & Gildea 2009).
6.2.2	 	 Functional classes
Closed word classes typically consist of function words (or grammatical words), i.e.
words with abstract, general meaning, or even no meaning at all but merely a gram-
matical function.80 While open classes tend to have many members – the reason they
are called ‘open’ is because new words are readily added – closed classes tend to be
small in size, since what makes them closed is the fact that new words are not readily
added. As mentioned, it seems a near-universal for languages to differentiate between
open and closed classes. In other words, most known languages have at least two open
classes (nouns and verbs) and one or a few closed classes. Languages differ considerably
not only in the number but also in what types of closed classes they have. There seems
to be a correlation between the kind of synthesis a language tends to allow and the
79.	 The original terminology is:
Head of predicate
phrase
> Head of referential
phrase
> Modifier of referential
phrase
> Modifier of predicate
phrase
(Hengeveld et al. 2004:â•›533)
Notice, however, that this hierarchy specifically refers to syntactic slots and does not take into account
other grammatical differentiations. Notice also that ‘Modifier of predicate phrase’ refers to manner
adverbs exclusively.
80.	Although there are languages where content words form a closed class, such as verbs (cf. footnote
74 above).
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 133
amount of closed word classes it has: languages with predominantly analytic construc-
tions employ function words to a higher degree than languages with predominantly
synthetic constructions (Schachter & Shopen 2007). This is hardly surprising, since
the grammatical information expressed by function words in predominantly analytic
languages is expressed through affixation in predominantly synthetic languages.

had a very meagre inventory of closed class items: a small set of

(See Schachter & Shopen 2007:â•›23f with references).
This section will bring up some reasonably common functional class categories, but
makes no attempt to be exhaustive in the list of known closed classes. For a detailed
overview of most of the known closed classes, see Schachter & Shopen (2007).
6.2.2.1	 Pronouns
Pronouns are used to substitute a noun or a noun phrase.81 This is usually a large and
diverse group of closed class words. Languages differ as to what types of pronouns
they have, or if they have any at all. Commonly recognized subtypes are personal,
possessive, demonstrative, indefinite, relative, reflexive, reciprocal and interroga-
tive pronouns. None of these subcategories are absolute but vary depending on lan-
guage as well as on theoretical orientation. Languages may employ affixes or clitics
to express the various pronominal functions. For a detailed discussion on pronouns
from a cross-linguistic perspective, see Bhat (2004). For an article-length overview,
see Schwartz (2000).
Personal pronouns typically refer to the speaker(s) (I, we), the addressee(s) (you),
as well as other things that the context makes clear (s/he, it, they). Many languages
distinguish between three persons (1, 2, 3) and two or three numbers (either singular
and plural or singular, dual and plural). Common personal pronoun paradigms are
(I am, for the moment, ignoring various politeness distinctions):
81.	 For an overview of other kinds of pro-forms, such as pro-sentences, pro-clauses, pro-verbs,
pro-adjectives, pro-adverbs (replacing sentences, clauses, verbs, adjectives and adverbs respectively)
and so-called interrogative pro-forms (e.g. the English who, what, where, when, also called content
question words), see, for example, Schachter & Shopen (2007:â•›31ff).

2 nhunt you nhip you two nhurr you
3 nhul s/he, it pul they two peln they
In the first paradigm (German) we find a system common to the languages of Europe,
where three persons and two numbers are distinguished: I, you (sg), he/she/it, we, you
(pl), they. In the second paradigm (Plang), a third number distinction is added, that
of dual, denoting two of the same. The third and fourth paradigms (Begak-Ida’an and
Kuuk Thaayorre respectively) show systems with an inclusive (1-i) versus exclusive
(1-e) distinction. Inclusive means that the addressee is included while exclusive means
that the addressee is not included in the group referred to. This might seem difficult
to grasp for those of us who are not used to such systems; one way of thinking about

while R2 means that the word is pronounced with a breathy voice.
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 135
it might be to picture a religious person addressing God and asking for forgiveness.
If, when praying for “forgiveness for our sins”, the inclusive pronoun would be used,
then the addressee, i.e. God in this case, would be included in the group of sinners! In
such a situation it is highly likely that a speaker of a language with inclusive/exclusive
distinctions would use the exclusive form, where “us” refers to ‘I and others’ but not
the addressee.83 Making some kind of inclusive/exclusive distinction is actually not
as exotic as one might think if one is mostly used to European languages. About one
third (68 or 34%) of the 200 languages in Cysouw’s (2011) sample differentiate between
‘we.incl’ and ‘we.excl’ (none of them pidgins or creoles).84 While the figures for this
feature are at the time of writing still temporary for the APiCS languages, they indicate
that only about an eighth have an inclusive/exclusive differentiation (Michaelis et al.
2013: feature 15). Pidgin and creole languages thus seem less likely than non-creoles to
make this differentiation.
Languages may also have paradigms where only person but not number is coded.
In his sample of 261 languages, Daniel (2011) found 9 (3.4%) languages that do not
differentiate formally for number in their independent personal pronoun system. An
example of such a language is Mamaindê where ta̱i simply means ‘first person’ i.e. may
translate into either ‘I’ or ‘we’ (or any other number, e.g. dual), wa̱i means ‘second per-
son’ (‘you’ singular or plural), and hãi means ‘third person’ (‘he/she/it/they’) (Eberhard
2009:â•›375). English constitutes a mixed type of language: the first and third persons
are distinguished for number, while the second is not. Roughly 20% of the languages
in Daniel’s sample have a mixed system; most of them differentiate in number in
the second (‘you.sg’ versus ‘you.pl’) and third persons (‘he/she/it’ versus ‘they’), as
opposed to English, which differentiates in the first (‘I’ versus ‘we’) and third persons
(Daniel 2011). While it is rare, there are also languages that do not have independent
personal pronouns, such as Mbay (Nilo-Saharan (Bongo-Bagirmi): Chad), where the
function of independent pronouns is carried out by affixes on other word classes, such
as verbs, nouns or adpositions (Keegan 1997). Only two languages (0.8%) in Daniel’s
(2011) sample lack independent personal pronouns: Acoma (Keresan (Keresan): USA)
and Wari’.
Demonstrative pronouns serve to point out something in a situation or a sen-
tence. Examples in English are this/these and that/those. Demonstratives typically
indicate distance between what is being referred to and the speaker (or, as the case
may be, the hearer). For instance, in English this implies a certain closeness to the
83.	 Frederic Baraga, Slovene bishop and documenter of Minnesota Ojibwe (Algic (Algonquian):
USA), indeed did make the mistake of using the inclusive ‘we’ and thus including God in the group
of sinners in his Ojibwe liturgical translations (Anthony Grant, p.c.).
84.	This conflates Cysouw’s (2011) values ‘Only inclusive’ and ‘Inclusive/exclusive’.
136	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
speaker while that implies a certain distance to the speaker. The relative differentiation
is, however, fuzzy. Thus it is quite acceptable for a customer to point at an item very
near to him/her and say ‘I’ll take that too’. It is common for languages to make two
or three distance distinctions, but there are some with only one (that is, where there
is no distance contrast) and some with as many as four distinctions. An example of
a language where the demonstrative pronouns do not have any distance distinctions
is Koromfe (distance distinctions are expressed with adjectives). There is one neutral
demonstrative pronoun, nɛŋ ‘thus’:
		 Koromfe (Niger-Congo (Gur): Burkina Faso, Mali)
	 (63)	 nɛŋ	 la	 gʊ	 mɔ̄	 sogɑ
		 thus	 cop	 pron.3sg.nhum	 also	 boundary
		 ‘This is the end of it.’ (i.e. the story)  (Rennison 1997:â•›258)85
English is an example of a language with two distance differentiations in its demonstra-
tive pronoun system: this (proximal or near) that (distal or further away). Hdi is an
example of a language with a three-way contrast of distance: ná ‘proximate’, yá ‘middle
distance’ and á ‘remote’.
		 Hdi (Afro-Asiatic (Biu-Mandara): Cameroon)
	 (64)	 a.	 bà-f-b-í	 tá	 ná-ná86
			 build-up-build-sg	 obj	 dem-dem
			 ‘I build this.’
		 b.	 bà-f-b-í	 tá	 yá-yá
			 build-up-build-sg	 obj	 dem-dem
			 ‘I build that.’
		 c.	 bà-f-b-í	 tá	 á-á
			 build-up-build-sg	 obj	 dem-dem
			 ‘I build that (over there).’  (Frajzyngier & Shay 2002:â•›84f)
Kambera (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia) is an example of a
language with a four-way distance contrast: ni ‘near/at speaker’, nai ‘middle distance
from speaker’, na ‘near addressee’ and nu ‘far from both speaker and addressee’ (Klamer
1998:â•›55f). Diessel (2011) surveyed languages for distance distinctions in adnominal
demonstratives, i.e. those that are not independent but must occur with the noun they
refer to, as in French ce livre-la ‘that book’ as in donne-moi ce livre-la ‘give me that book’
(lit. give-me this book-there); something like *donne-moi ce, without the noun, would
85.	 Determiners may be used as demonstrative pronouns in Koromfe. The choice of determiner/
demonstrative is based on the animacy and number of the noun it refers to (Rennison 1997:â•›259).
86.	The demonstrative in Hdi is reduplicated when used as an independent pronoun.
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 137
not be possible. The WALS figures are thus not for pronominal demonstratives (i.e.
those which replace a noun or noun phrase), yet they are interesting; Diessel found
that the most common strategy (with 127 of 243 languages or 54.3%) was for languages
to have a two-way contrast and the second most common strategy to have a three-way
contrast (88 languages or 37.6%). Only eight languages (3.3%) made use of a four-way
contrast and four87 (1.6%) of a five-way contrast, while seven languages (3%) lacked
any distance contrast altogether. The figures are at the time of writing still temporary
for this feature in APiCS (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 33), but they seem to indicate
that almost two thirds of the APiCS languages have a two-way contrast while almost
one fifth lack any distance contrast. This would imply that pidgin and creole languages
are more prone to lack distance contrasts and less prone to have three-way contrasts
than non-creole languages.
Reflexive pronouns typically denote an entity which is identical with another
grammatical argument (usually the subject) in the same clause. That is, they are
co-referential with a co-occurring nominal. In English this is expressed by adding
â•‚self/â•‚selves to a form of the personal pronoun: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself,
ourselves, yourselves, themselves. In many languages, English among them, the same
form may also be used as an emphatic, as in He himself did it. A little over half of the
languages sampled by König & Siemund (2011), 94 (of 168 or 56%), have identical
forms for the emphatic and the reflexive. The remaining 74 (44%) differentiate between
the two. An example of a language that differentiates between the reflexive and the
emphatic is German. Compare:
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (65)	 a.	 Das	 Mädchen	 sah	 sich	 im	 Spiegel
			 art.n	 girl	 see.past	 refl	 prep.dat	 mirror
			 ‘The girl saw herself in the mirror.’
		 b.	 Der	 President	 selbst	 hielt	 eine	 Rede
			 art.m	 president	 emph	 hold.past	 art.f	 talk
			 ‘The president himself gave a talk.’  (source: personal knowledge)
The pattern differs somewhat in APiCS, where the two strategies each comprise about
one third of the languages: in 27 of 69 languages88 (39.1.3%) the two forms are identi-
cal, while in 25 (36.2%) they are differentiated (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 88). The
remaining quater consists of languages that either have a mixed system or lack reflexive
87.	 These are Koasati (Muskogean (Muskogean): USA), Malagasy (Austronesian (Barito):
Madagascar), Maricopa (Hokan (Yuman): USA) and Navajo.

138	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
pronouns altogether. Languages that do not have specific free forms for reflexive mean-
ings may employ verbal affixes to express reflexivity.
Reciprocal pronouns are also co-referential with a co-occurring nominal, but the
crucial thing about reciprocals is that they also express mutuality, as in the English each
other and one another (e.g. They supported each other/one another). Again, languages
differ with respect to reciprocal constructions. More than half of the languages in
Maslova & Nedjalkov’s (2011) sample have two formally distinct forms for reciprocity
and reflexivity (99 of 175 or 56.6%), as English does. In about a quarter of the sample
(44 languages or 25.1%) they are formally identical, as in Wari’:
		 Wari’ (Chapacura-Wanhan (Chapacura-Wanhan): Brazil)
	 (66)	 wac	 xucucun	 hwijima’
		 cut	 refl/recip.3pm	 children
		 ‘The children cut themselves. / ‘The children cut each other.’  (Everett 1998:â•›186)
In Example (66) the same form, xucucun, may translate either into ‘themselves’ (reflex-
ive) or ‘each other’ (reciprocal). A minority of languages (16 or 9.1%) have a mixed
system, where the reflexive marker may be used as a reciprocal but where there is also
a separate reciprocal form, as in German:
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (67)	 a.	 sie	 mögen	 sich
			 3pl	 like.3pl	 refl/recip
			 ‘They like themselves.’ / ‘They like each other.’
		 b.	 sie	 mögen	 einander
			 3pl	 like.3pl	 recip
			 ‘They like each other.’  (source: personal knowledge)
While sich in (67a) is ambiguous and can have either a reflexive or a reciprocal mean-
ing, einander in (67b) is unambiguous and can only have a reciprocal meaning. The
remaining 16 languages (9.1%) in Maslova & Nedjalkov’s (2011) sample do not have any
formal ways of marking reciprocal, but instead employ very iconic constructions such
as repeating the verb or clause. An example of such a language is Cantonese:
		 Cantonese (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese): China)
	 (68)	 léih	 hóyíh	 bōng	 ngóh	 ngóh	 hóyíh	 bōng	 léih
		 2sg	 can	 help	 1sg	 1sg	 can	 help	 2sg
		 ‘We can help each other.’ (lit. ‘You can help me I can help you.’)
 (Matthews & Yip 1994:â•›87)
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 139
The languages in APiCS show a slightly different picture (Michaelis et al. 2013:
feature 89). A slightly higher proportion (47 of 69 or 68.1%)89 than the languages in
the WALS sample make a formal distinction between reciprocity and reflexivity. The
proportion of mixed-system languages is also slightly higher in the APiCS sample
than the WALS sample, with nine (13%) languages. The proportion of languages hav-
ing identical forms, however, is slightly lower, with ten (14.5%) languages. Finally, the
proportion of languages without any reciprocal construction at all is lower, with only
three (4.3%) languages: Belizean Creole, Bislama (Creole (English-lexified): Vanuatu)
and Fanakalo (Pidgin (Zulu-lexified): South Africa).
Languages that do not have reciprocal pronouns but have other kinds of reciprocal
markers tend to indicate reciprocity through verbal affixes.
Relative pronouns serve to introduce a modifying clause within the noun phrase.
The English relative pronouns are who, whom and which.
	 (69)	 The man who phoned yesterday.
		 The girl whom I talked to.
		 The chair which I sat on.
In Example (69) the relative pronouns who and which introduce a clause (X phoned
yesterday/I talked to X/I sat on X) which serves as a modifying element to the noun
phrase (the man/the girl/the chair). What a relative clause does, very simplified, is to
delineate a specific antecedent (element referred to) to which a certain proposition is
true. In other words, The man who phoned yesterday points out that particular man (out
of a potential of several different men) who phoned the day before (and, for instance,
not the one who phoned today), and The chair which I sat on points out the particular
chair (out of several potential chairs) which I sat on (and not, for example, the empty
one). Languages have different strategies for expressing relativity, and a given language
may combine strategies. English, for instance, makes use of relative pronouns, but also
allows a gap strategy as in The girl Ø I talked to, where there is no relative marker at all.
In fact, while the gap strategy is very common cross-linguistically, comprising 125 of
166 languages (or 75.3%) in Comrie & Kuteva’s (2011b) sample, to make use of a rela-
tive pronoun is actually quite rare, found in only 12 (or 7.2%) languages in the sample.
The proportions differ minimally if the contact languages are subtracted, with 123 of
164 languages (75%) having the gap strategy and 12 (7.4%) having a relative pronoun.
While the figures for the languages in APiCS are at the time of writing still temporary
for this feature, they indicate that these languages differ from the above mentioned
pattern. The APiCS languages seem to have a higher proportion of languages with a
relative pronoun (about one fifth) and a much lower proportion of languages making
89.	Information is missing for some languages, which is why the total is 69 instead of the usual 76.
140	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
use of a gap strategy (just under two fifths) (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 92). For more
details on relative clauses and various relativization strategies, see 11.2.3.
Indefinite pronouns differ from the pronouns discussed above in that they are
used to refer to non-specific entities. In English this is expressed by such pronouns as
somebody, someone, something, anybody, anyone, anything. To have such transparent
pronouns as English (some/any + body/one/thing), based on generic nouns, is not as
common as those of us who are very used to English might think:â•›85 of 326 (26.1%)
languages in Haspelmath’s (2011b) sample make use of this strategy. It is especially
common in Africa, Papua New Guinea and on the Pacific islands. Most commonly
(194 languages or 59.5%) indefinite pronouns are based on interrogatives (see below),
as in Russian ktoto ‘someone’ (from kto ‘who’ + â•‚to ‘indef’) and čtoto ‘something’
(from čto ‘what’ + â•‚to ‘indef’) (Haspelmath 2011b). Rather rare is to have either special
forms, unrelated to anything else, found in only 22 (6.7%) languages of the sample, or
to have a mixed system (23 languages or 7.1%), where the two forms behave differently.
An example of a language with a special indefinite form is Swedish with the special
någon ‘someone’ and något ‘something’, historically derived from an entire Proto-
Scandinavian clause: *ne wait ek hwarir (hwarii̯aʀ) ‘I don’t know who’ (lit. ‘not know
I who’) whence also the Danish nogen and the Norwegian noen (Hellquist 1980: sv).
An example of a language with a mixed type of interrogative is Khmer (Austro-Asiatic
(Khmer): Cambodia), where kè: ‘someone’ is based on the generic noun ‘person’ while
ʔvɤy(â•‚mú:əy) ‘something’ is based on the interrogative ʔvɤy ‘what’ (Haspelmath 2011b
citing Jacob 1968). Extremely rare is to not have any indefinites at all, but to express
the equivalent meaning through an existential construction. There are only two
such languages (0.6%) in Haspelmath’s sample, Mocoví (Guaicuruan (Guaicuruan):
Argentina) and Tagalog (Example (70)).
		 Tagalog (Austronesian (Meso-Philippine): Philippines)
	 (70)	 may	 d<un>arating	 araw-araw
		 exist	 <actor voice>come.ipfct	 day~red
		 ‘Someone comes every day.’ (lit. ‘There exists (one who) comes every day.’)
 (Schachter & Otanes 1983:â•›276)
The pattern for the languages in the APiCS differs radically from the pattern in
Haspelmath’s sample. The latter contains only one contact language (Sango) which
affects the figures minimally. With the APiCS languages the most common strategy
by far is to have a generic noun-based indefinite pronoun (Michaelis et al. 2013: fea-
ture 21). This is found in a 50% of the sample (38 languages). Only three languages
(3.9%) have interrogative-based indefinites: Chinuk Wawa (Pidgin (Chinook-lexified):
Canada, US), Singapore Bazaar Malay (Pidgin (Malay-lexified): Singapore) and Sri
Lankan Malay (Creole (Malay-lexified): Sri Lanka). The proportion of languages with
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 141
a special form is roughly the same among the APiCS languages as in Haspelmath’s
sample (5 languages or 6.6%),90 while the proportion of languages with a mixed sys-
tem is higher (10 languages or 13.2%). Only one language (1.3%) expresses indefinite
meaning through an existential construction: Zamboanga. 17 APiCS languages (22.4%)
have the value ‘Other’. Data is missing for Media Lengua and Yimas-Arafundi Pidgin.
Interrogative pronouns are pronouns used to form content questions. English
interrogative pronouns are who and what. Interrogatives and the kinds of strate-
gies languages have for forming content questions will be discussed further in
Section 12.1.2.
6.2.2.2	 Adpositions
Adpositions are words that express the relation between the noun phrase they govern
and some other element in the clause or sentence.91 They may come either before, after
or even within the noun phrase they govern and typically express temporal, spatial or
similar connections.
Prepositions precede the noun phrase they govern. This is common cross-
linguisticallyÂ�
: in Dryer’s (2011i) very large sample, 512 of 1185 (43.2%) languages have
prepositions. English is one of them, with such prepositions as in/near (in the house),
to/from (to the sea), on/under/beside/above (on the table), by (by the side).
Postpositions follow the noun phrase they govern. Languages with postpositions
are somewhat more common than those with prepositions in Dryer’s database, com-
prising 48.7% (577 languages). An example of a language with postpositions is Aari.
Example (71) shows how the postpositions zan ‘top, superior location’ and dar ‘to’ fol-
low the noun phrases they govern.
		 Aari (Afro-Asiatic (South Omotic): Ethiopia)
	 (71)	 a.	 diirá	 zan	 dóqse
			 grass	 on	 sat.3sg
			 ‘He sat on (the) grass.’
		 b.	 gában	 dar	 káyye
			 market	 to	 went.3sg
			 ‘He went to (the) market.’  (Hayward 1990:â•›489f)
90.	The five languages are Jamaican (Creole (English-lexified): Jamaica), Korlai (Creole (Portuguese-
lexified): India), Pidgin Hindustani (Pidgin (Fiji Hindi-lexified): Fiji), Saramaccan (Creole (English-
lexified): Suriname) and Papiamentu (Creole (Spanish-lexified): Netherlands Antilles).
91.	 They govern the noun phrases in that they not only link to them, but also typically require that
the noun phrase they link to be modified grammatically one way or another. For instance to governs
the oblique case: to him (but not *to he). For more on government and agreement, see 7.2.2.
142	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Inpositions, which occur inside the noun phrase they govern, form a very rare type
of adposition. Only eight languages (0.7%) in Dryer’s sample have this type of adposi-
tion. It should be noted that Dryer here includes clitics, such as in the example below.
		 Anindilyakwa (Australian (Anindilyakwa): Australia)
	 (72)	 namwirntakakpwarthanaka	 [akini=lhangwa	 apwirtha]
		 3:1pl.were.scared.ints	 3:4.that=abl	 3:4.whale
		 ‘They were all very scared of the whale.’ (lit. …the-of whale)  (Leeding 1989:â•›312)
In Example (72) the clitic lhangwa ‘about’ is placed inside the noun phrase akini
apwirtha ‘that whale’.92
Some languages (58 or 4.9%) have more than one type of adposition. The lan-
guages in this group usually have both prepositions and postpositions, though there
are also cases of languages with both postpositions and inpositions, such as Hanis
Coos (Oregon Coast (Coosan): USA) (Dryer 2011i). There are also languages that do
not have adpositions at all, such as Kutenai (Isolate: Canada). This group comprises 30
(2.5%) languages of Dryer’s sample.
The figures for the languages in APiCS are at the time of writing still temporary
for this feature, but it seems that they differ radically from the pattern in Dryer’s
sample, where the figures change minimally once Ndyuka (Creole (English-lexified):
Suriname) and Sango have been subtracted (both prepositional languages). To have
prepositions as the dominant strategy seems much more common in the APiCS sam-
ple, occurring in something like seven eighths of the languages (Michaelis et al. 2013:
feature 4). Only very few seem to have postpositions as their dominant strategy. This
seems to suggest that it is more likely that a pidgin or creole language will have preposi-
tions than it is that a non-creole will have prepositions.
6.2.2.3	 Numerals
Numerals are sets of words used to indicate the precise number of something. They
typically have characteristics of both open and closed class words. Cardinal numerals
are used to express the number of individuals in a set, as in four cars. Ordinal numerals
are used to express the rank in a series, as in the fourth car. Grammatically numerals
may either constitute their own closed class, or overlap with other word classes in the
language. In Finnish (Uralic (Finnic): Finland), for instance, the numeral inflects for
case just like nouns (Sulkala & Karjalainen 1992) while in Krongo (Kadugli (Kadugli):
Sudan) numerals behave like verbs (Reh 1985). In English numerals form their own class.
92.	This is in the source treated as a ‘peripheral case’ clitic but conforms to Dryer’s definition of
adpositions in that “it combines with a noun phrase and indicates the grammatical or semantic
relationship of that noun phrase to the verb in the clause” (Dryer 2011i).
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 143
In most languages larger numbers are built by combining smaller numbers, or
bases. English, for example, has 10 as its numeral base, called a decimal system: the
numbers 1–10 are expressed by unique words, while higher numbers are expressed
by multiples of 10 (e.g. six-teen ‘6â•›+â•›10’ or thir-ty-one ‘3â•›×â•›10â•›+â•›1’). This is a very com-
mon strategy, found in 125 of 196 (or 63.8%) languages in Comrie’s (2011c) sample.
A vigesimal system, not uncommon, uses a base of 20, found in 42 (21.4%) languages
in Comrie’s sample. This conflates Comrie’s categories ‘pure vigesimal’ and ‘hybrid
vigesimal-decimal’ (where the system is vigesimal up to 100 but then switches to deci-
mal, as is the case in Danish). A base-20 system as defined in Comrie (2011c) is found
in Chimalapa Zoque (Mixe-Zoque (Mixe-Zoque): Mexico), as in ʔiʔpšaŋʔ makkanh ‘30’
(20â•›+â•›10) and tuhtaŋ ʔiʔpšaŋʔ ‘120’ (6x20) (Johnson 2000:â•›414f). Other number bases
are base-2, found in Aiome (Lower Sepik-Ramu (Annaberg): Papua New Guinea) with
nogom ‘1’, omngar ‘2’, omngar nogom ‘3’ (2â•›+â•›1) (Harrison 2007:â•›188); base-3, found in
Som (Trans-New Guinea (Finisterre-Huon): Papua New Guinea) (Hammarström
2010:â•›9); base-4, found in Ngiti (Nilo-Saharan (Lendu): DR Congo) (Kutsch Lojenga
1994:â•›357); baseâ•‚5, found in Supyire (Niger-Congo (Gur): Mali) (Carlson 1994:â•›167);
base-6, found in Ndom (Kolopom (Kolopom): Papua New Guinea) (Harrison
2007:â•›191); base-12, found in northern Nigeria (Hammarström 2010:â•›12ff) and base-15,
found in Huli (Trans New Guinea (Engan): Papua New Guinea) (Cheetham 1978:â•›16).
Languages may also lack a numeral base, in that there are no numerals above one,
found in Amazonian languages (Hammarström 2010:â•›8).
That which Comrie calls a restricted system, found in 20 (10.2%) languages of his
sample, denotes “a numeral system that does not effectively go above around twenty”
(Comrie 2011c). An example of this is Kayardild with a number system going up to
four but not further: warirra ‘nothing’, warngiida ‘1’, kiyarrngka ‘2’, burldamurra ‘3’,
mirndinda ‘4’ and muthaa ‘many’ (Evans 1995:â•›242). A language with a very restricted
numeral system indeed is Pirahã, which has no numerals at all (Everett 2005:â•›526).
Some languages use body parts to extend their numeral system. This is found in only
4 (2%) languages in Comrie’s sample, and is a feature known to be concentrated in
Highland New Guinea, although it is also found in other parts of the world (Harrison
2007:â•›174). An example of such a language is Kobon (Trans-New Guinea (Madang):
Papua New Guinea), which functions as follows:
to count from 1 to 12: [on the left side of the body] little finger, ring finger, middle
finger, index finger, thumb, wrist, middle of forearm, inside of elbow, middle of upper
arm, shoulder, collarbone, hole above breastbone. The count can then continue down
the right-hand side of the body, from the collarbone to the (right) shoulder as 13 to the
little finger as 23. It is then possible to reverse the count, starting from the little finger
of the right hand as 24 back up to the hole above the breastbone as 35 and down again
to the little finger of the left hand as 46. (Comrie 2011c)
144	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
6.2.2.4	 Articles
Articles are used to indicate whether the noun phrase referred to is identifiable or
not. This is typically expressed in terms of definiteness: a definite item is presumed
to be possible to identify (the book) whereas an indefinite item is not assumed to be
identifiable (a book). For an article-length overview of articles, see Schwartz (2000).
Definite articles encode specificity and are used with an identifiable noun or noun
phrase, for example the book in Give me the book, where the use of the definite article
the indicates that the speaker assumes that the addressee is able to identify the specific
book referred to. A definite article may precede the noun phrase, as in English, or fol-
low it, as in Lakhota.
		 Lakhota (Siouan (Siouan): USA)
	 (73)	 chā’	 ki	 hā’ske
		 tree	 the	 tall
		 ‘The tree is tall.’  (Van Valin 1977:â•›36)
In Example (73) the definite article ki ‘the’ follows the noun (chā’ ‘tree’) it specifies.
Languages may use the demonstrative to indicate definiteness. In his sample of 620
languages, Dryer (2011a) found 216 (34.8%) languages where the definite article was
distinct from the demonstrative (as the case is in English) and 69 (11.1%) languages
where the demonstrative is used to indicate definiteness. An example of the latter type
is Takia, where the demonstrative (y)en/an/on ‘this (particular)’ (e/a/o if followed by
one or more modifiers) is used to mark definiteness, as shown in (74):
		 Takia (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
	 (74)	 yu	 o	 inug	 an	 sa-n	 biouŋ
		 war	 dem	 formerly	 dem	 poss-3sg	 clothes
		 ‘The things from the first war.’  (Ross 2002b:â•›224)
Some languages (92 or 14.8%) do mark definiteness, but through affixation and not
separate words, as in the Swedish construction boken ‘the book’ (bok-en ‘book-def’).
Others (45 or 7.3%) do not have definite articles, but do have indefinite ones (see
below). The second biggest group in Dryer’s sample (198 languages or 31.9%), however,
has neither definite nor indefinite articles. Korean is an example of such a language.
The reading of Example (75) is thus ambiguous with respect to definiteness.
		 Korean (Isolate: N, S Korea)
	 (75)	 ai	 ka	 pang	 ey	 ki-e	 tul-e	 w-ass-ta
		 child	 nm	 room	 to	 crawl-inf	 enter-inf	 come-pst-dc
		 ‘The/A child crawled into the/a room.’  (Sohn 2001:â•›267)
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 145
The above figures change insignificantly when the two contact languages Ndyuka
and Sango, both having a definite word distinct from the demonstrative, are subtracted.
The languages in the APiCS display a different pattern (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature
28). While here too the biggest group (38 languages or 50%) distinguishes between
the definite article and the demonstrative, the second largest group, with 20 languages
(36.3%), is actually the one where the two forms are identical. Nine languages (11.8%)
do not have any definite article but do have indefinite ones, while nine (11.8%) have nei-
ther type. None of the APiCS languages make use of affixation to indicate definiteness.
Indefinite articles are used when an entity referred to is not presupposed to be
identifiable by the addressee, for example a pencil in Give me a pencil, where no specific
pencil is referred to. While we might be used to the fact that ‘a’ (indefinite article) and
‘one’ (numeral) are distinct words, it is actually equally common to use the same word
for the two expressions. In his sample of 534 languages, Dryer (2011e) found 102 (19.1%)
languages that behave like English, i.e. where the indefinite article and the numeral
are two distinct forms (a book versus one book). In roughly the same proportion of
languages, 112 (21%), the same form is used, as in Swedish en bok ‘a/one book’. There
are thus two ways of translating a sentence like (76) into English.93
		 Swedish (Indo-European (Germanic): Sweden)
	 (76)	 jag	 har	 en	 bok
		 1sg	 have	 art/num	 book
		 ‘I have a book.’/‘I have one book.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In 24 (4.5%) languages indefiniteness is marked through affixation. An example of such
a language is Limbu (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): Nepal), as in the construction yaŋdhik ‘a
rupee’ (yaŋ-dhik lit. ‘money-a’) (van Driem 1987:â•›32). However, the biggest group by far
in this sample is the group of languages that neither have any definite nor any indefinite
article (see Example (75) above). These figures differ minimally once Ndyuka (where
the indefinite word is the same as ‘one’), the only contact language in the sample, has
been taken out.
Again the pattern exhibited in the APiCS sample differs (Michaelis et al. 2013:
feature 29). About a quarter (20 or 26.3%) of the languages differentiate between the
indefinite article and the word for ‘one’, while more than half (46 languages or 60.5%)
have identical forms. One (1.3%) language, Yimas-Arafundi Pidgin, lacks indefinite
articles altogether but has definite articles, and, as mentioned above, nine languages
(11.8%) have neither definite nor indefinite articles. This seems to indicate that pidgin
93.	 This is actually somewhat simplified, as stress serves to disambiguate the two: if en is stressed, it
means ‘one’ and if it is unstressed it means ‘a’.
146	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
and Â�
creole languages are more likely than non-creoles to use the same form for indefi-
nite article ‘a’ and the numeral ‘one’.
6.2.2.5	 Auxiliaries
Auxiliaries are semantically more or less empty verbs conveying mainly grammati-
cal information. While some auxiliary verbs can also be used as full verbs (e.g. have)
and thus have a semantic content, when they function as auxiliaries their primary
task is not to convey meaning but grammatical information. A verb phrase contain-
ing auxiliaries will thus also contain a lexical verb or ‘main’ verb, which carries the
semantic content of the construction. For example, the verb phrase will jump contains
the auxiliary will (expressing future tense) and jump (expressing the semantic content
jump). Without the lexical verb the verb phrase makes no sense: *kangaroo will is not
a grammatical sentence in English.
Auxiliaries typically express tense, aspect, mood, valency, voice or polarity of the
verb phrase they belong to. Note that not all languages make use of auxiliaries; each of
these grammatical categories may also be expressed morphologically or prosodically.
Also, a language may mark part of a category with auxiliaries and part of it with some
other method. Tense, for instance, is in English marked morphologically in the past
(walk versus walked) but with the help of an auxiliary in the future (walk versus will
walk). For more on tense, mood, aspect, valency and voice, see Chapters 8 and 9. For
more on polarity, see 12.1.1.2 and 12.1.2.1. For a very thorough survey and discussion
of auxiliaries and auxiliary verb constructions, see Anderson (2009). For an article-
length overview, see Anderson (2000). Some examples follow.

In Examples (77) and (78) auxiliaries (will and ta) are used to mark tense (in both
cases the future). In Example (79) the auxiliary á is used to mark perfective aspect. In
Examples (80) and (81) the auxiliaries must and harus ‘must’ are used as modal mark-
ers. In Example (82) the auxiliary máápɨɨtɨ́ɨ́ is used to mark the causative (â•‚yá is an
agreement marker). Incidentally, Example (82) also shows that an auxiliary may follow
the verb it modifies. In Examples (83) and (84) the passive is marked by the auxiliaries
was (an inflected form of be) and do ‘passive’ respectively. Example (84) also shows
that an auxiliary need not be immediately adjacent to the verb it modifies. Finally, in
Example (85) the auxiliary en marks negation.
6.2.2.6	 Conjunctions
Conjunctions serve to connect entities (words, phrases or clauses). There are two
types of conjunctions, those that assign the entities an equal status (coordinating con-
junctions) and those that make one entity subordinate to another (subordinating
conjunctions).
148	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Examples of English coordinating conjunctions are and, but and or, as in, for
example, The boy and the girl played with each other. English uses the same marker to
connect verb phrases and clauses too, as in The boy ate and drank and The boy sneezed
and the girl coughed. In other languages the choice of conjunction is dependent on
what kinds of elements are to be conjoined. An example of a language that has three
different conjunctions, one for connecting noun phrases (iyo), one for connecting verb
phrases (oo) and one for connecting clauses (â•‚na suffix), is Somali:
		 Somali (Afro-Asiatic (Eastern Cushitic): Somalia)
	 (86)	 a.	 rooti	 iyo	 khudrat
			 bread	 and	 fruit
			 ‘bread and fruit’
		 b.	 wuu	 cunay	 oo	 cabbay
			 foc.3sg.m	 eat	 and	 drink
			 ‘He ate and drank.’
		 c.	 macallin-ku	 wuxuu	 joogaa	 dugsi-ga	 carruur-ta-na	 waxay
			 teacher-art	 foc.3sg.m	 be	 school-art	 children-art-and	 foc.3pl
			 ku	 cayaarayaan	 dibed-da
			 prev	 play	 outside-art
			 ‘The teacher is in the school and the children are playing outside.’
 (Haspelmath 2011c citing Berchem 1991:â•›324ff)
In Haspelmath’s (2011c) sample of 301 languages, 161 (53.5%), English among them, use
the same marker to coordinate noun phrases as they use to coordinate verb phrases,
while 125 (41.5%), Somali among them, use different markers. The remaining 15 (5%)
simply juxtapose the entities that are coordinated. For more on coordination, see 11.1.
ExamplesofEnglishsubordinatingconjunctionsarebecause,if,that,while,although,
and so on, as in She said that she would come or If it rains I won’t go. While most lan-
guages in Dryer’s (2011j) sample have separate words94 – a full 503 of 660 (76.2%) – some
languages (64 or 9.7%) express subordination through suffixation. The subordinating
conjunction may precede the clause it subordinates, as is the case in English.
	 (87)	 She said [that she would leave].
In (87) the subordinating conjunction that precedes the clause she would leave. This is
the most common strategy in Dryer’s sample, found in 399 (60.5%) languages. In 96
(14.5%) languages the subordinating conjunction follows the clause it subordinates. An
example of such a language is Jamul Tiipay, where the subordinator kenaach ‘because’
follows the clause it subordinates:
94.	Although not necessarily free forms, as clitics are also counted as ‘words’ Dryer’s survey.
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 149
		 Jamul Tiipay (Hokan (Yuman): Mexico, USA)
	 (88)	 Juan	 may	 we-yiw	 xemaaw	 [xenu-ch	 kenaach]
		 PN	 neg	 3-come	 not	 be.sick-SS	 because
		 ‘Juan didn’t come, because he is sick.’  (Miller 2001:â•›256)
A very rare strategy, found in only 8 (1.2%) languages in Dryer’s sample, is to have the
subordinator appear inside the clause it subordinates, as is the case in Nkore-Kiga:
		 Nkore-Kiga (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Uganda)
	 (89)	 [wa-ruhitsi	 ku	 a-za	 ku-taasya]	 a-shanga	 oburo	 ni-bu-sya
		 mr-hyena	 when	 he-go	 to-return	 he-find	 millet	 PC-it-cook
		 ‘When Brer Hyena starts to bring home (the cattle), he finds the millet cooking.’
 (Taylor 1985:â•›26)
In Example (89) the subordinating conjunction ku ‘when’ appears inside the clause
(waruhitse aza kutaasya) it subordinates. Some languages (93 or 14.1%) have mixed
systems, in that they may allow for both preceding and following conjunctions or in
that they have both separate words and suffixation to express subordination. For more
on subordination, see 11.2.
clause introducers
Urarina, a language isolate spoken in Peru, has, in addition to verbal inflection, a small class
of function words that indicate the type of clause coming up. The introducer ʤatera (‘how
about…; what if…; etc.’) indicates that a suggestive clause is coming up:
	 ʤatera	 hitarĩi	 kaʉ	 tete-riʉ
	 how.about	 all	 here	 make-sug.1sg
	 ‘What if I put all (those things) here?’
	 (Talking about items someone else had promised.)  (Olawsky 2006: 267)
6.2.2.7	 Interjections
Interjections are their own utterances that typically “express a speaker’s current mental
state or reaction toward an element in the linguistic or extralinguistic context” (Ameka
2006:â•›743). This is the only closed word class that is probably universal to all spoken
languages. Interjections are typically used to express emotions (which includes the
use of swear words), but there are other functions as well. Examples of some English
interjections are ouch!, yuck!, psst!, and so on. Interjections are often, but by no means
always, monomorphemic, do not take any morphological marking, and very often dis-
play sound sequences otherwise not typical for the language. For instance, in English
words usually have to include at least one vowel. However, interjections such as psst!
violate that pattern. A crucial feature of interjections is that they form independent
150	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
nonelliptical utterances, i.e. they are full utterances that do not constitute a shortened
version of a longer utterance.
Interjections may have different functions. Expressive interjections indicate the
speaker’s mental state. These can be either emotive or cognitive. Examples of emo-
tive interjections are the English yuck! ‘I am disgusted’ or ouch! ‘I feel (sudden) pain’,
or the Swahili (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Tanzania) salala! ‘I am surprised’ (Eastman
1992:â•›276). Cognitive interjections indicate the state of knowledge or thoughts of the
speaker, as in the English aha! ‘I understand’ or the Italian bo’! ‘I don’t know’. Conative
interjections are utterances directed at an addressee. Examples are the English shh! ‘Be
silent!’ (which may also be called a volitive interjection) and the Italian to’! ‘Take this!’
(which may also be called a presentational interjection). Phatic interjections are used
as communicative cues, for instance the English uh-huh ‘I am following what you’re
saying’ or such things as greetings (e.g. English hello! or Swedish hej! ‘hello’) and leave-
taking (e.g. German tschüss! ‘bye’).
6.3	 Parts-of-speech in sign languages
While cross-linguistic overviews on parts-of-speech systems in sign languages are
very much in their infancy, it is safe to assume that sign languages, just like spoken
languages first of all distinguish between open and closed word classes.95 Secondly,
it also seems safe to assume that the categories Noun and Verb (or entity and event
signs in the terminology of Schwager & Zeshan 2008) are universal to sign languages,
even though there might be significant overlap between them, much like we find in,
for example, Nuuchahnulth. Thus in IPSL the sign for WORK can function either as a
noun or a verb, as Example (90) shows:
		 IPSL (Sign Language: India, Pakistan)
	 (90)	 index1 work a-lot
		 a.	 ‘I work a lot.’
		 b.	 ‘My work is a lot.’
		 c.	 ‘I have a lot of things to do (works).’  (Schwager & Zeshan 2008:â•›513)
In Example (90) the sign WORK can refer either to the verb (event) ‘to work’ (a) or to
the noun (entity) ‘work’ (b and c). However, as with spoken languages, there tends to
be subtle differences between entity and event words, for example with respect to their
morphology or syntax, which indicates that it makes sense to assume two different
95.	 As was mentioned in Section 5.3, sign languages make use of both derivation and compounding
to form new words.
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 151
word classes, albeit with considerable overlap. In LSQ, for instance, word-mouthing is
primarily associated with entity signs while expressive mouth movement is primarily
associated with event signs (Voghel 2005). In ASL an event sign cannot pre-modify
other signs and cannot combine with a quantifier (Schwager & Zeshan 2008).
Sign languages may also have modifiers (property signs in Schwager & Zeshan
2008), which may function either as adjectives, i.e. signs that modify entity signs, or as
adverbs, i.e. signs that modify event signs. As in spoken languages, sign languages may
differ in the scope and usage of these signs. Thus DGS property signs can be used in
predicate functions, as modifiers of entity signs and as modifiers of event signs, while
property signs in KK are only used in predicate functions.96
		 DGS (Sign Language: Germany)
	 (91)	 a.	 BIRD SMALL DEAD

		 KK (Sign Language: Indonesia)
		 c.	 index1 deaf gather, good
			 ‘It is nice when I get together with deaf people.’
 (Schwager & Zeshan 2008:â•›533)
In Example (91a) the sign small is used as an entity modifier (modifying BIRD)
and the sign DEAD is used predicatively. In Example (91b) the sign good is used to
modify an event (work). Example (91c) shows the usage of the property sign GOOD
in KK, which can only be used predicatively.
At this stage there is no cross-linguistic survey of the various closed classes in
sign languages. IPSL, for instance, has a number of small, closed word classes, such
as the non-manual signs expressing “yes”, “no” and various adverbial meanings,97 the
classificatory stems consisting of handshapes that function as indicators of an entity
engaged in an event (see 5.3 for an example in ASL), various functional particles,
discourse markers, indexical signs (effectively pronouns and demonstratives) and
auxiliaries. A cross-linguistic survey might find that classificatory stems, or classi-
fiers, are very common to sign languages, possibly even universal (Sandler 2006).
96.	Notice also that there is a certain overlap between entity and property signs in DGS: the sign
GEHÖRLOS can mean both ‘deaf’ and ‘deaf.person’. The sign DEAF in KK, however, always means
‘deaf.person’ (Schwager & Zeshan 2008:â•›525f).
97.	 Notice that this makes adverbs a closed class in IPSL, which also seems to be the case in ASL and
Austrian Sign Language (ÖGS) (Schalber & Grose 2008).
152	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Auxiliaries, which tend to carry grammatical information on agreement and valency
(see, for example, Müller de Quadros 2008), might also turn out to be common across
languages. Pronouns are typically expressed indexically, typically by pointing with the
index finger (Schwager & Zeshan 2008). While interjections seem universal to spoken
languages, there is at this stage no cross-linguistic study available on the equivalent to
interjections in sign languages.
A survey of numeral signs cross-linguistically might show prevalence for manual
counting, with the digits of the hand serving for the numerals one to nine.98 However,
it is likely that there will be differences in exact handshape, both between languages,
as is the case between Catalan Sign Language (LSC) and Spanish Sign Language (LSE),
both used in Spain, (Fernández-Viader & Fuentes 2008), and between varieties of the
same language, as is the case in NZSL (McKee et al. 2008).
	 6.4	 Summary
All languages, both spoken and signed, have two basic types of word classes (parts-of-speech),
open classes and closed classes. The open classes, typically lexical classes, freely allow produc-
tive additions of new words to them, while closed classes, typically functional classes, do not
readily permit additions. The maximum number of open classes a language can have is four:
nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. While there might be considerable overlap between the
characteristics of nouns and verbs in some languages, it seems universal that there is never
complete overlap. Languages differ as to whether adjectives and adverbs form separate, open
classes in their system.
Languages differ radically as to how many and which closed word classes they might have,
but typical categories include pronouns, adpositions, conjunctions, auxiliaries and articles. Inter-
jections form the only closed word class that seems to be universal in spoken languages.There is
a correlation between the amount of synthesis allowed in a language and the amount of closed
class items it has.
Numerals may have formal affinities with either nouns or verbs, or constitute their own
word class. Languages differ with respect to their numeral base, and may also have mixed
systems, or may use body-parts to convey a numeral expression. There are also languages
with no numerals at all.
Sign languages also organize their lexicon into open and closed word classes. While no
major cross-linguistic survey for sign language parts-of-speech is available at this date, it seems
that sign languages make use of rather similar types of classes. The open word classes for sign
98.	But cf. NZSL, where one variant for ‘8’ is expressed with a single closed fist held towards the
middle of the upper chest (McKee et al. 2008:â•›302).
	 Chapter 6.â•‡ The lexicon and its classes	 153
languages are entity signs (nouns), event signs (verbs) and property signs (modifiers functioning
as either adjectives or adverbs or both). Closed classes may be, for example, pronouns (typically
indexal), auxiliaries, classifiers and numerals. Classifiers seem to be universal to sign languages.

Nominal categories and syntax
Nouns may be subcategorized according to different criteria, for instance if they can
be counted or not. When several elements form a unit with a noun we have a noun
phrase. Noun phrases may be specified for whether they refer to one or several enti-
ties, whether they belong to any specific class or which relation they have to the other
constituents in the phrase. The elements in the phrases tend to have an internal or-
ganization, with a head and one or more dependent(s). In this chapter I very briefly
show some of the main subcategorizations for nouns before giving a brief overview
of some major noun phrase categories (7.1). In 7.1.1 I present various number values
found in the languages of the world, while in 7.1.2 I present some of the gender or
noun class systems found cross-linguistically. In 7.1.3 I discuss case and give a neces-
sarily brief overview of some of the most common cases. Section 7.2 deals primarily
with the inner organization of noun phrases: I first define the terms head and depen-
dent and show how languages vary with respect to locus of marking (7.2.1) and then
discuss the difference between government and agreement (7.2.2). Section 7.3 gives an
overview of noun phrase operations in sign languages.
7.1	 NP categories
The noun phrase (NP) is the entity which functions as an argument, such as a subject
or an object, in a sentence. It consists minimally of a noun or a substitute for a noun
(for example a pronoun), but may also consist of several words that belong together
as a phrase, where the noun or its substitute constitutes the core element (the head).
For instance, the sentence Kangaroos jump consists of the noun phrase kangaroos and
the verb phrase jump. The noun phrase here consists of only one word, the noun kan-
garoo. However, the sentence The kangaroo is jumping also only consists of one noun
phrase (the kangaroo) and one verb phrase (is jumping), even though each of these
phrases contain two words. Examples of various noun phrases, here underlined, are
He jumped, The two of them were jumping, The happy kangaroo on the other side of the
fence was jumping, The man who won the lottery danced.
Nouns can be divided into a number of grammatical subclasses, usually based
on common semantic properties of the noun. While the following subclasses do not
constitute an exhaustive list, they are commonly found in the languages of the world.
156	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
what’s in a name?
In Mehek (Sepik (Tama Sepik): Papua New Guinea) each person’s name has four counterpart
forms: one of the forms is used when the person is being reprimanded, the other of the forms
is used when the person has done something good or has returned from a journey, the third
form is a whistle call used to call the person if s/he is out of visual range, and the fourth form
is a song used as a form of greeting or praise.  (Adam Hatfield, p.c.)
Proper names, or proper nouns, in contrast to common nouns (all others), are typi-
cally used to refer to specific individuals or places. Examples of proper nouns are
Peter, Mr. Smith, London, Italy, Mississippi River, Mount Kilimanjaro. While common
nouns can be specified for definiteness, proper nouns usually cannot. Thus we might
need to specify the chair (definite) as opposed to a chair (indefinite), but we rarely
need to specify *the Italy as opposed to *an Italy, since the inherent meaning of the
proper noun is that it is a specific (definite) individual or place we are referring to.
There are, however, occasions when the use of definite articles with proper nouns
might be justified, for example I did talk to a Jenny at the conference, but she didn’t
look like the Jenny you described, where the implication is that we need to distinguish
between several individuals with the same name.
Common nouns are often divided into count nouns, i.e. such nouns that can be
counted, and mass nouns (or noncount nouns), i.e. such nouns that cannot be count-
ed. Examples of count nouns are tree, star, property. Examples of mass nouns are air,
sand, anger. Count nouns may refer to sets containing one or more separable entities
of the same: a tree (/star/property), two trees (/stars/properties), many trees (/stars/
properties), while mass nouns generally do not (compare *a sand, *two sands, *many
sands) but tend to refer to continuous entities that are not easily separable. Greater
or smaller quantities of mass nouns may then be expressed by other quantifiers, as
in English some and much: some air (/sand/anger; compare ??some tree/star/property),
much air (/sand/anger; compare ??much tree/star/property).
Languages may also subclassify nouns according to whether they can or cannot
be possessed, whether nouns must obligatorily be possessed as opposed to posses-
sion being only a non-obligatory option, or whether possession can be transferred
or not (so-called alienable versus inalienable possession). An example of a language
with a subcategory of nouns that cannot be possessed is Tzutujil (Mayan (Mayan):
Guatemala) (Dayley 1981:â•›199ff) where nouns referring to natural phenomena, wild
animals or people cannot be possessed, for example juyuʔ ‘mountain’, b’ajlam ‘jaguar’,
q’isaaneel ‘witch’ – something like *nuujuyuʔ ‘my mountain’, *nuub’ajlam ‘my jaguar’
or *nuuq’isaaneel ‘my witch’ is not possible while, for example nuutz’iiʔ ‘my dog’,
nuukaab’ ‘my raw sugar, honey’ and nuutiiʔ ‘my meat’ are quite grammatical and ac-
cepted forms. In Tzutujil there is also a subcategory of nouns that must be possessed,
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 157
Â�
inherently possessed nouns (also called bound nouns or, which is more precise,
obligatorily Â�
possessed nouns, cf. Nichols & Bickel 2011b), where the item referred
to has to be specified with respect to whom it belongs. In other words, expressing
the noun without a possessor marker specifying who the item belongs to would be
ungrammatical. These are usually nouns that have some inherent relationship with
something else, such as kinship terms, body parts, tools, abstract nouns, and so on,
for instance nuumaam ‘my grandchild’ (but *maam ‘grandchild’) (Dayley 1981:â•›205).
This is often called inalienable possession. However, it makes sense to differentiate
between inherent possession, where the owner must be specified, and inalienable
possession, where the owner of an item does not necessarily have to be specified for
the utterance to be grammatical. The difference between alienable and inalienable
possession lies in how the possession is expressed. Possession of alienable items, that
is, such items where ownership can be transferred (for example worldly goods) is
expressed differently from possession of inalienable items, i.e. such items that cannot
be transferred (for example body parts or kinship terms). Thus in Nalik, inalienable
possession has to be marked as in Example (92a), while alienable possession has to
be marked as in Example (92b):
		 Nalik (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
	 (92)	 a.	 a	 langa-go	 ka	 burus
			 art	 ear-my	 3	 hurt
			 ‘My ear hurts.’
		 b.	 ka	 zaxot	 a	 buk	 surugu
			 3	 like	 art	 book	 of.I
			 ‘He wants my book.’  (Volker 1994:â•›178f)
In (92a) possession is expressed with the suffix â•‚go, while in (92b) possession is ex-
pressed with the free word surugu. Languages that distinguish between alienable and
inalienable possession thus have at least two ways of expressing possession. Languages
with inherently possessed nouns, on the other hand, can make do with only one way
of expressing possession – the crucial thing about inherently possessed nouns being
simply that the owner has to be specified, which may well be the same kind of posses-
sive expression as expressing ownership of nouns that are only optionally possessed.
This is shown in the examples from Tzutujil mentioned above, where possession may
be expressed with the suffix nuuâ•‚ irrespective of whether the noun is inherently pos-
sessed or only optionally possessed.
Languages may subcategorize noun phrases (i.e. both nouns and their substitutes)
according to animacy. The most basic animacy distinction would be between animate
and inanimate nouns, such as between dog and stone. English reflects this distinc-
tion in that we normally would use he (or she) when referring to a dog but it when
158	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Â�
referring to a stone. However, languages may make further distinctions. For instance,
in English proper names and kin terms can usually not be combined with the indefi-
nite article: compare Peter but *a Peter, a friend of mine but *a mother of mine. We
might say here that English displays an Animacy Hierarchy along the lines of proper
nouns and kin terms > other animates, where ‘>’ indicates that proper names and
kin terms are higher up the hierarchy in terms of definiteness (they are inherently
definite) than other animates.99 English also differentiates between humans versus
non-human animates and inanimates with respect to which relative pronoun is used:
compare the book which I read; the bird which flew away (not *the book whom I read or
*the bird who flew away) and the girl whom I saw (not *the girl which I saw). We could,
in fact, refine the English animacy hierarchy to something like proper nouns and kin
terms > humans > other animates >inanimates. Languages might code things accord-
ing to even more precise distinctions, also taking into account whether the NP refers
to the speaker, the addressee, or some third person, apart from the other distinctions
mentioned. A more detailed Animacy Hierarchy would then be as in Figure 7.1:
	 1st person > 2nd person > 3rd person > proper noun/kin > human > animate100 > inanimate
	 speaker	 addressee
Figure 7.1â•‡ The Animacy Hierarchy.
In Figure 7.1 the further left the slot is, the more ‘animate’ the NP is. The term ‘animate’
is slightly misleading here, since obviously the noun mother does not indicate a living
being more animate than the noun woman or the noun dog. However, if we think of
the hierarchy as structured according to sociocentric orientation (Whaley 1997:â•›172)
or as arranged according to a principle of empathy (Payne 1997:â•›151) the hierarchy
becomes more transparent. In essence it simply captures the notion that we humans
tend to identify most with ourselves (I am most aware of myself), then with the ad-
dressee (I am very aware of you, whom I am talking to), then with some other third
person (I am quite aware of him/her/them, whom I am talking about), then, in con-
tinued descending order, with John and my sister (proper names/kin), with the boy in
the yard (human NP), with the cow in the field (animate NP), and, finally, the entity
that we tend to identify the least with would be the stone (inanimate NP). In fact we
99.	This could also be termed Topicality Hierarchy or a hierarchy of topic-worthiness, since the
hierarchy in principle depicts the order in “which noun phrases are more likely to occur as topics”
in discourse (Comrie 1989:â•›198).
100.â•‡ It would be more accurate to have the term ‘non-human animate’ here, as it denotes all animals
(or animate beings) that are not human.
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 159
shall see throughout the remainder of this book that languages often have to code
things differently in their grammar depending on where the noun phrase is placed in
the Animacy Hierarchy.
7.1.1	 	 Number
7.1.1.1	 Number values
Most languages have a grammatical way of expressing whether one or more real
world entities are referred to.101 In English, for example, there are usually two forms
to choose between, one a base form indicating singular (one entity) and the other
the base form modified in some way indicating plural (more than one entity), as in
chair versus chairs. There are languages, however, where the base form of the noun
actually does not give any information as to the number of entities involved, called
general number in Corbett (2000:â•›9ff). While this is cross-linguistically rare, it can be
found in Bayso, where lúban ‘lion’ is not specified for number and thus means that it
could be one or more lions, as opposed to lúbantiti which means exactly one lion, and
lúbanjool, which means many lions, as in Example (93):
		 Bayso (Afro-Asiatic (Eastern Cushitic): Ethiopia)
	 (93)	 a.	 lúban	 foofe
			 lion.general	 watched.1sg
			 ‘I watched lion’ (number not specified; could be one or more than one)
		 b.	 lúban-titi	 foofe
			 lion-sg	 watched.1sg
			 ‘I watched a lion’ (exactly one)
		 c.	 lúban-jool	 foofe
			 lion-pl	 watched.1sg
			 ‘I watched lions’ (many)102  (Corbett 2000:â•›11 citing Dick Hayward, p.c.)
The most common system is to have a two-way contrast between singular and plural,
as in English. However, it is not an absolute universal to express plurality: there is
at least one known language, Pirahã, which actually does not have any grammatical
number (Everett 2005).103 A sentence like in Example (94) simply does not specify the
NPs for number, as can be seen from the various translations it can get:
101.â•‡ For a discussion on verbal number, expressing multiple events, see Corbett (2000:â•›243ff)and 8.4.
102.â•‡ Since Bayso also has paucal (for example lúbanjaa ‘(a few) lions’), the plural refers to more than
just a few of an entity. See below.
103.â•‡ It seems that Kawi or Old Javanese (Austronesian (Javanese): Indonesia) and Classical Chinese
(Sino-Tibetan (Chinese): China), both extinct, also lacked grammatical number; see Corbett (2000:
51) for references.
160	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Pirahã (Mura (Mura): Brazil)
	 (94)	 hiatíihi	 hi	 kaoáibogi	 bai-aagá
		 Pirahã	 3	 evil.spirit	 fear-cop
		 ‘The Pirahã people are afraid of evil spirits.’ or
		 ‘The Pirahã people are afraid of an evil spirit.’ or
		 ‘A Pirahã is afraid of evil spirits.’ or
		 ‘A Pirahã is afraid of an evil spirit.’  (Everett 2005:â•›623)
In Example (94) neither hiatíihi ‘Pirahã personâ•›/â•›Pirahã people’, nor hi ‘3rd person
(singular or plural)’, nor kaoáibogi ‘evil spirit(s)’ are specified for number.
It is not uncommon for languages to have yet another number value, the dual,
which specifies that two (and exactly two) entities are referred to. An example of a
language with the three number distinctions singular, dual and plural is Lavukaleve:
		 Lavukaleve (Solomons East Papuan (Lavukaleve): Solomons Islands)
	 (95)	 singular	 dual	 plural
		 filifil	 filifilil	 filifilimal	 ‘nail’
		 mulukita	 mulukitaul	 mulukitavil	 ‘orange’
 (Terrill 1999:â•›96f)
In Lavukaleve nouns are inflected for three numbers, with the dual and the plural
overtly marked through suffixes (bolded), as shown in (95). Notice that in languages
with these three number distinctions the plural necessarily means ‘more than two’,
since the dual specifies for ‘(exactly) two of X’. Examples of pronouns with the num-
ber distinctions singular, dual and plural were given in Section 6.2.2.1.
two of the same and natural pairs
Tocharian (Indo-European (Tocharian)) is a cover term for two distinct languages,Tocharian A
(East Tocharian or Agnean) and Tocharian B (West Tocharian or Kuchean). The documents we
have for these languages, mostly translations of Buddhist texts, are from the 6th to 8th centu-
ries.Tocharian A texts have only been found aroundTurfan and Quārāšahr (the ancient Agni –
hence the alternative name Agnean) whileTocharian B texts have been found fromTumšuq in
the west toTurfan in the east, especially in Kuča (hence the alternative name Kuchean), along
the eastern branch of the Silk Road in present day Xinjian (western China).
	 While both Tocharian languages retained the Indo-European dual, they also developed
another kind of dual, the paral (also called ambal), used only for naturally occurring pairs, as
in, for example,‘both eyes’:
	 Tocharian A:â•‡ aśäm
̣	 Tocharian B:â•‡ eśane
According to Das grammatische Raritätenkabinett in Konstantz (http://typo.uni-konstanz.de/
rara/intro/), this is not known for any other language (living or extinct) in the world. For more
information on Tocharian, see Krause & Slocum (2007–2010).
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 161
Tough it is rather uncommon, languages may have a further number distinction,
the trial, specifying for three (and exactly three) entities, giving a four-way distinc-
tion of singular, dual, trial and plural. There are no known languages that have trial
but not dual (yielding a three-way system with singular, trial, plural). An example of a
language with a trial number category is Larike.
Larike (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia)
singular dual trial plural
1-incl – itua we two itidu we three ite we many
1-excl aʔu I arua we two aridu we three ami we many
2 ane you irua you two iridu you three imi you many
3 mane he/she matua they two matidu they three mati they many
 (Laidig & Laidig 1990:â•›90)
The Larike free pronouns, shown above, tend to only be used for human referents and
so only one form is given for the 3rd person (with pronominal affixes a formal distinc-
tion is made between humans and nonhumans). In a sentence like (96) the 3rd person
can thus only refer to persons.
		 Larike (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia)
	 (96)	 matidu-tue	 au-huse	 nusa
		 3tri:S-live	 at-there	 island
		 ‘Those three live on the island over there.’  (Laidig & Laidig 1990:â•›96)
Notice that the trial, when it occurs, is employed in the pronominal system only; there
are, as yet, no known languages that employ the trial for nouns. In some languages
the form termed ‘trial’ may actually refer to more than three, and would, as such, be
better termed paucal (‘a few’). An example of a language with a number category that
means roughly “three or a small group” is Manam (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua
New Guinea) where the pronominal forms termed ‘triple’ is “three or a few in a group”
(Turner 1986:â•›66). A more precise way of describing the numbers of Manam would
therefore be to say that it has a four-way system of singular (one X), dual (two X), pau-
cal (a few X but more than two) and plural (more than a few X). Most languages with
a paucal number category also have a dual category, but Bayso, mentioned above, has
a three-way distinction of singular (one X), paucal (a few X) and plural (more than a
few X). The most complex systems known have five different number values. Lihir, for
example, has singular (one X), dual (two X), trial (three X), paucal (a few X but more
than three) and plural (more than a few X):104
104.â•‡ Notice, however, that the exact status of the trial is not known; it could be that it refers to ex-
actly three, in which case it is a genuine trial, but it could also mean that it refers to ‘three or a few’,
like the ‘triple’ in Manam, in which case it might be a type of paucal.
162	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Lihir (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
singular dual trial paucal plural
1-incl – kito kitol kitrahet giet
1-excl yo gel getol gehet ge
2 wa gol gotol gohet go
3 e dul dietol diehet die
 (Corbett 2000:â•›25 citing Malcolm Ross, unpublished fieldnotes)
There have been claims of languages with a number value ‘quadral’ (four of X), such as
Sursurunga (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea) (Hutchisson 1986), which
also has a five-way number distinction. However,
[s]ince plural pronouns are never used with relationship terms [i.e. terms reflecting
kinship], the use of these terms skews number reference for both trial and quadral
forms (although not for dual), so that trial comes to mean a minimum of 3, and
quadral a minimum of 4. (Hutchisson 1986:â•›10)
Hence Sursurunga number values labelled ‘trial’ and ‘quadral’ do not refer to exactly
three and four units respectively. A more exact way of labelling the Sursurunga num-
ber system would therefore be with the distinctions singular (one X), dual (two X),
paucal (three or so X/a few X), greater paucal (four or so X/slightly more than a few
X) and plural (many X).
To distinguish between a ‘normal amount’ and a ‘greater than normal amount’, as
is done in the Sursurunga paucal is very rare and, if anything, is found with the plural
yielding a greater plural (or global plural). The distinction would then be something
like ‘many’ and ‘very many indeed’. An example of a language with greater plural is
Banyun (Niger-Congo (Northern Atlantic): Senegal); compare bu-sumɔl ‘sg-snake’
with i-sumɔl ‘pl-snakes’ and ba-sumɔl ‘gr.pl-snake’, where the difference between
i-sumɔl and ba-sumɔl is that the latter “is used when the number cannot be counted
or the speaker feels it unnecessary” (Corbett 2000:â•›31).
7.1.1.2	 Obligatoriness
Languages differ as to whether it is actually necessary for the speakers to mark num-
ber and if so, which nominals have to be marked. In English all sorts of nominals
have to be marked for number, whether they denote humans, animals or inanimate
objects. That is, grammatical marking of plural is generally obligatory and is done
on all kinds of nominals. This is the most common pattern, comprising 133 of 291 (or
45.7%) in Haspelmath’s (2011d) sample, which was coded for whether plural marking
was obligatory, optional, or lacking altogether, as well as whether the nominals in-
volved were human animates or discrete inanimates (i.e. count noun inanimates). In
55 languages (18.9%) plural marking is optional for all nominals, while in 15 languages
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 163
(5.2%) plural marking is obligatory for human and only optional for inanimate nomi-
nals. A number of languages in the sample only mark plurality on human nouns: in 40
(13.7%) of them plural marking is obligatory while in 20 (6.9%) it is optional. 28 (9.6%)
languages of the sample lack grammatical marking of plural. There are no languages
in the sample that mark plurals (optionally or obligatorily) only on inanimate nouns
but not on human nouns, nor are there any languages where plural marking is obliga-
tory with inanimates but only optional with humans. In other words, Haspelmath’s
(2011d) sample exhibits a pattern that is in accordance with the Animacy Hierarchy: if
a language has a split in obligatoriness of plural marking, where some nouns have to
be marked for plural and others do not, it is safe to assume that it is the human nouns
that will have obligatory marking and the inanimate nouns that will have optional
marking.
The languages in the APiCS differ from the languages in Haspelmath’s sample in
their pattern with respect to obligatoriness in plurality marking. While the proportion
of languages lacking a nominal plural is similar to that in Haspelmath’s sample, the
proportion of languages for the other values differ, as summarized in Table 7.1:

have obligatory plural marking on all nouns.

164	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
7.1.1.3	 Associative plural
Associative plural (also called group plural, among other terms)106 basically means
‘X and those associated with X’. It is typically used with nouns referring to humans,
usually proper names, kinship terms, titles and occupations. Strictly speaking this
is not a number value or a category of number, although it is almost always used in
combination with number. For a discussion on the difference between associatives
and number, see Corbett (2000:â•›101ff, especially 110f).
An example of a language with associative plural is Hawai‘i Creole English with
the clitic â•‚dem, as in John-dem ‘John and them/John and his friends/John and those
associated with him’ or ma faðɛ-dem ‘my father and them/my father and those as-
sociated with him’. This differs semantically from additive plurals, i.e. those kinds of
plurals that simply mean more of the same, which is what the discussion above has
focussed on. A construction like John-dem does not mean *‘many Johns’, nor does ma
faðɛ-dem mean *‘my many fathers’. Instead the associative denotes a group of unspeci-
fied individuals that are in some way associated with a named referent. I will follow
Daniel & Moravcsik (2011) and term the named referent (e.g. John or my father) the
focal referent, and term the group of individuals that are associated with the focal
referent associates. Notice that the associates in associative plural may form a group
of different individuals: those associated with the focal referent may be of different
genders or ages, or have different kinds of kinship relations to each other. The as-
sociates in an associative plural may thus form a heterogeneous group, as opposed to
the nouns referred to in an additive plural (girls means ‘many young female humans’,
mothers means ‘many females who have children’). For a very thorough discussion on
the semantic properties of associative plurals, see Moravcsik (2003).
Associative plurals are most commonly formed with proper names and kinship
terms. In their sample of 237 languages, Daniel & Moravcsik (2011) found that the vast
majority, 200 languages (or 84.4%), have associative plural. English, like most other
Western European languages, belongs to the minority group that does not have any
associative plural. The most common strategy, found in 105 languages (or 44.3%) of
the sample, is for a language to have the same form for associative plural as for addi-
tive plural. An example of such a language is Udihe; compare Examples (97a and b):
		 Udihe (Altaic (Tungusic): Russia)
	 (97)	 a.	 tege	 tege-ziga
			 gown	 gown-pl
				 ‘gowns’
106.â•‡ For this discussion I collapse everything that is ‘more than one’ into the term plural. In other
words, I am here not differentiating between dual, trial, paucal and plural.
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 165
		 b.	 Guatu	 Guatu-ziga
			 PN		 PN-pl
						 ‘Guatu and those associated with him.’
 (Nikolaeva & Tolskaya 2001:â•›115f)
In Example (97) the same form is used to mean ‘more of the same’ (tegeziga ‘gowns’)
as well as ‘those associated with X’ (Guatuziga ‘Guatu and those associated with him’).
It is also quite common to have different forms for additive and associative plural,
a strategy found in 95 (or 40.1%) of the languages in Daniel & Moravcsik’s sample.
This is, for instance, the case in Hawai‘i Creole English. The above mentioned clitic
â•‚dem can only mean ‘and those associated with X’. A construction like *buk-dem (‘the
book and those associated with it’) is not possible, unless used in a fairy-tale sense to
give the book its own cartoon character. Crucially, *buk-dem can never have the addi-
tive plural meaning of ‘books’.
The figures for the languages in APiCS are at the time of writing still temporary
for this feature, but they seem to indicate a different pattern from the languages in
WALS (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 24). In the APiCS sample the picture seems less
radical in that only slightly over half of the languages have associative plural (com-
pared to the 84.4% in WALS) while some two fifths lack the associative plural (com-
pared to the 16.4% in WALS). It thus seems rather more common for a non-creole to
have an associative plural marker than it is for a pidgin or creole language.
7.1.2	 	 Noun classes (gender) and classifiers
7.1.2.1	 Gender
Gender or noun class is a grammatical classification for nouns or substitutes for
nouns (such as pronouns). For very thorough discussions of gender, see Corbett (1991
and 2007), which this section relies heavily on. Those of us mainly used to Indo-
European languages might think of ‘gender’ as a classification largely corresponding
to sex, with the distinctions ‘female’, ‘male’ and possibly a non-sex category ‘neuter’,
but as we shall see this is by no means a universal system. The actual evidence for a
gender or noun class system lies outside the noun itself, as it is only reflected by way
of agreement in the words associated with the given noun. In other words, it is not
possible to determine which gender or noun class a word in a language with such
a system belongs to by just looking at it. Rather, the gender or noun class has to be
established through the different agreement patterns that different genders or noun
classes take. In German, for instance, we have three genders or noun classes, mas-
culine, feminine and neuter. However, the gender of the words Stuhl ‘chair’, Blume
‘flower’ and Buch ‘book’ can only be determined by some kind of agreement form
outside the noun, such as the definite article (der Stuhl ‘the.m chair’, die Blume ‘the.f
flower’, das Buch ‘the.n book’) or the form of the adjective (ein rot-er Stuhl ‘a red-m
166	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
chair’, eine rot-e Blume ‘a red-f flower’, ein rot-es Buch ‘a red-n book’).107 Agreement
targets may be adjectives, various kinds of pronouns, articles, possessives, numerals,
verbs, participles, adverbs, adpositions and in Zeeuws Dutch even complementizers,
as shown in Example (98).
		 Dutch, Zeeuws (Indo-European (Germanic): The Netherlands)
	 (98)	 a.	 …dank	 (ik)	 kommen
			 that	 I	 come
		 b.	 …daj	 (gie)	 komt
			 that	 you.sg	 comes
		 c.	 …datje	 (jij)	 komt
			 that	 he	 comes
		 d.	 …dase	 (zie)	 komt
			 that	 she	 comes
		 e.	 …dat	 (et)	 komt
			 that	 it	 comes
		 f.	 …dame	 (wunder)	 kommen
			 that	 we	 come
		 g.	 …daj	 (gunder)	 komt
			 that	 you.pl	 come
		 h.	 …danze	 (zunder)	 kommen
			 that	 they	 come  (Bennis & Haegeman 1984:â•›41)
In Example (98) the complementizer takes different forms depending on the person,
number, and in the case of the third person singular, the gender of the subject pro-
noun in the clause: dank ‘that.I’; daj ‘that.you’ (either singular or plural); datje ‘that.
he’, dase ‘that.she’ or dat ‘that.it’; dame ‘that.we’ and danze ‘that.they’. The pronoun is
usually omitted, but may appear if the speaker wishes to stress it, which is why it is
given in parentheses. For more on agreement see 7.2.2.
It is common to include so-called pronominal gender systems as an instance of
a gender agreement system. These are instances when the gender of the free pronoun
is determined by the word it refers to (its antecedent), as in English The man… he…
or The woman… she… where the pronoun has to be in the masculine (he) when the
antecedent is a noun referring to something male (the man) and in the feminine
(she) when the antecedent is a noun referring to something female (the woman).
English is an example of a language with a pronominal gender system, where the free
pronouns constitute the only evidence for gender. This is cross-linguistically rare
(CorbettÂ�2011a).
107.â•‡ In actuality the indefinite article ein/eine also shows agreement, but is ambiguous for mascu-
line and neuter without an adjective.
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 167
It might seem like a given that gender systems will somehow be sex-based in that
males belong to the masculine gender, females to the feminine, and in case of a third
gender, that non-sex items will belong to the neuter. However, while sex-based gender
systems are much more common than non-sex based systems, they are not universal:
of the languages in Corbett’s (2011b) sample with a gender system, 75% were sex-based
while 25% were not. The latter group of languages all base their gender system on some
form of animacy (Corbett 2011b). An example of a language with a non-sex-based gen-
der system is Plains Cree (Algic (Algonquian): Canada), where there are two genders,
one for animate nouns and one for inanimates (Wolfart 1973:â•›20). This means that both
male and female humans and animals belong to the same gender, the animate one. Kisi
also has a non-sex-based gender system with its four genders denoting animates, inani-
mates, collective plants and grains, and liquids, respectively (Childs 1995:â•›148). To those
of us who are most used to sex-based systems, like those found in French or German,
this might seem counterintuitive, as might the concept of more than three genders. But
etymologically ‘gender’ derives from Latin genus ‘kind, sort’; gender and noun class thus
mean the same thing, namely the categorization of nouns into different classes.
Gender or noun class systems may have a minimum of two genders, as is the case
in French, or as many as around 20 genders, as is the case with some dialects of Nige-
rian Fula (Niger-Congo (Northern Atlantic): Nigeria). However, more common cross-
linguisticallyÂ�is to not have any gender system at all, as can be seen on Map 7.1. In
Corbett’s (2011a) sample of 257 languages, more than half (145 languages or 56.4%) lack
gender.

168	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Of those languages that do have gender, the most common is to have only two, found
in 50 (19.5%) languages. An example of a language with two genders is, as mentioned,
French, with feminine (e.g. la table ‘the.f table’) versus masculine (e.g. le livre ‘the.m
book’). Swedish is another example of a language with two genders, common (en bok
‘a.c book’) and neuter (ett träd ‘a.n tree’). Due to its pronominal gender system, Eng-
lish is classified as having three genders, a group comprising only 26 languages (10.1%)
in Corbett’s sample. To have four genders is even rarer, found in no more than 12
(4.7%) languages. An example of a language with four genders is Lak, as summarized
in Table 7.2 adapted from Corbett (1991:â•›25):
Table 7.2â•‡ The Lak (Nakh-Daghestanian (Lak-Dargwa): Russia) gender system.
gender criterion example gloss
I male rational las husband
II female rational ninu mother
III other animate nic bull
IV residue nex river
The four genders in Lak are assigned according to the following principles: genders I
and II comprise only humans and spiritual beings; gender III comprises non-rational
animates (various animals and insects) as well as most inanimate objects; gender IV
comprises some animates (such as, for example, spiders and dragonflies), some inani-
mate objects, most liquids, and abstract nouns (Corbett 1991:â•›25). This kind of system
is common, though by no means exclusive to, Nakh-Daghestanian languages spoken
in the Caucasus.
The last group in Corbett’s sample, comprising 24 (or 9.3%) languages, are those
languages with five or more genders. The majority of the languages in the sample with
very many genders can be found in sub-Saharan Africa, as shown by the black dots
in Map 7.1 above. An example of a language with five genders is Ju|’hoan, where the
gender assignment is roughly as shown in Table 7.3.
An example of a language with very many genders indeed is Nkore-Kiga, with 17
different noun classes, assigned roughly on semantic criteria such as animacy, shape
and abstractness (Taylor 1985:â•›124ff).
Languages vary with respect to how the gender distinctions pattern in the in-
dependent personal pronominal system. As mentioned above, it is most common
cross-linguisticallyÂ�to not have any genders at all. This holds for the independent pro-
nouns too, as evidenced in Siewierska’s (2011b) sample, where as many as 254 of 378
languages (67.2%) lack gender distinctions. Of those languages that do have gender
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 169
distinctions in their independent personal pronouns, the most common pattern, with
61 languages (16.1%), is that found in English, where only the third person singular
pronoun has any gender distinctions. This is also found in Xokléng:
Table 7.4â•‡ The Xokléng (Macro-Ge (Ge-Kaingang): Brazil)
independent pronoun in the nominative (Wiesemann 1986:â•›361).
person singular plural
1 nũ	 ‘I’ nã	 ‘we’
2 mã	 ‘you’ mã, mẽ	 ‘you’
3m ta	 ‘he’
óg	 ‘they’
3f ði	 ‘she’
As the table above shows, the masculine/feminine distinction made in the third per-
son singular is not made in the third person plural, where the form óg ‘they’ gives no
information as to gender.
In 42 languages (11.1%) gender distinctions are restricted to the third person,
but are found in both the singular and non-singular. This means that gender dis-
tinctions might be made in all numbers of the language, or in the singular and
some other non-singular number. An example of the former is Worora (Australian
(Wororan): Australia), which distinguishes between four genders (masculine, femi-
nine, neuter-1 and neuter-2) in the third person singular, dual, trial as well as plural
(Siewierska 2011b).
Some languages, 18 (4.8%) in Siewierska’s sample, make gender distinctions in the
third person as well as either the first or the second person. An example of a language
with a maximum set of gender distinctions is Korana, where three genders (common,
masculine and feminine) are distinguished in all persons and all numbers:
Table 7.3â•‡ The Ju|’hoan (Khoisan (Northern Khoisan): Angola, Namibia, Botswana)

Very rare systems are those that distinguish gender in the first or second persons, but
not in the third, found only in two (0.5%) languages in Siewierska’s sample: Burunge
and Iraqw, both Afro-Asiatic Southern Cushitic languages in Tanzania. Angas, which
is not in the sample, is another language with this kind of system:

2. m ɣā

3. – nyÇš̄ mwá
As the table above shows, Angas makes two gender distinctions in the second person
singular, but nowhere else.
One language (0.3%) in Siewierska’s sample, Dagaare, has gender distinctions in
the third person plural only, and nowhere else:
Table 7.7â•‡ The Dagaare (Niger-Congo (Gur): Ghana)
independent pronouns (Siewierska 2011b citing Bodomo 1997:â•›71).

2. – foo yɛnee

	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 171
As the table above shows, the Dagaare independent pronouns make no gender dis-
tinctions at all in the singular, while in the plural the two genders (human versus non-
human) are distinguished in the third person.
The languages in APiCS display a rather similar pattern to those in the WALS,
where the pattern is affected minimally by the subtraction of Ndyuka and Sango
(none of which have gender distinctions). To not have any gender distinctions is by
far the most common with 56 (of 73 or 76.7%) languages (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature
13). If a language has gender distinctions in the independent pronoun system, it will
be in the third person. Most of the APiCS languages with gender distinctions in the
independent pronoun system have that distinction in the singular only. This group
comprises 12 (15.8%) languages. Notice that this proportion is almost exactly the same
as that of the WALS sample with the same value (see Table 7.8 below). Four languages
(5.3%), Kikongo-Kituba (Creole (Kikongo-Kimanyanga-lexified): DR Congo), Lingala
(Creole (Bobangi-lexified): DR Congo),108 Michif and Sri Lanka Portuguese (Creole
(Portuguese-lexified): Sri Lanka) have gender distinctions in both singular and plural
of the third person, while two languages (2.6%), Cape Verdean Creole of Brava and
Cape Verdean Creole of Santiago (both Portuguese-lexified creoles of the Cape Verde
Islands), have gender distinctions in the first and/or second person but not the third.
The figures are summarized in Table 7.8.
Table 7.8â•‡ Figures for gender distinctions in independent pronouns in WALS
(contact languages subtracted) and APiCS languages, absolute numbers in parentheses.

What the table above us tells us is that pidgin and creole languages are less likely than
non-creole languages to have gender distinctions in the first or second persons of
their independent pronouns, a phenomenon which is very rare in non-creoles too.
Pidgin and creole languages are also somewhat more likely to lack gender distinctions
in their independent pronouns than non-creoles, although in both samples this is the
preferred strategy by far.
108.â•‡ Note that this classification follows APiCS and differs from WALS, where Lingala is classified
as a Niger-Congo Bantoid language.
172	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
7.1.2.2	 Classifiers
Noun classifiers should be distinguished from noun classes/gender. As mentioned
above, gender or noun classes are identified through agreement, which means that the
forms of the words associated with the noun in question vary according to the gender
of the noun. In other words, gender or noun class is identified through some kind of
morphological process which has to involve some other word in the clause. Also, in
gender or noun class systems, all nouns paradigmatically belong to one category or
another. In other words, nouns obligatorily belong to one noun class or another in a
closed grammatical system. Gender or noun class systems are also typically shown
through various fusional processes, such as affixation, and as such tend to occur in
languages that allow fusion. While some languages have a high number of genders
or noun classes, the number is never unlimited. Classifiers, on the other hand, are
free and invariant forms that assign nouns to a given category, usually semantically
based. They are not dependent on agreement with a word outside themselves; “[t]hey
are a type of non-agreeing noun categorization device, their choice being determined
by lexical selection, and not by matching any inflectional properties of nouns with
any other constituents of a noun phrase” (Aikhenvald 2000:â•›81). The same noun may
take different classifiers, depending on context or what exactly the speaker wishes to
express. For instance in Minangkabau the noun limau ‘lemon’ may take either the
classifier batang ‘cl:tree’ or the classifier buah ‘cl:fruit’:
		 Minangkabau (Austronesian (Malayic): Indonesia)
	 (99)	 batang	 limau		 buah	 limau
		 cl:tree	 lemon		 cl:fruit	 lemon
		 ‘lemon (the tree)’	 ‘lemon (the fruit)’
 (Aikhenvald 2000:â•›84 citing Marnita 1996)
Classifiers may themselves function as nouns, and constitute a more open class of
markers than gender or noun class markers. The choice of classifier is usually based
on semantic characteristics in terms of everyday interaction. Languages may thus
have classifiers labelling things as human, animals, plants, liquids, artefacts, or clas-
sifiers denoting various forms, shapes and structures, or classifiers denoting various
kinds of social status, such as kinship, social functions, age, and so on.
There are other kinds of classifiers. Numeral classifiers “characterize nouns in nu-
merical noun phrases and expressions of quantity” (Aikhenvald 2000:â•›426), usually
according to animacy, physical properties (such as shape, size, structure, etc.), and
so on.109 Classifiers in possessive noun phrases may be either of various types. With
109.â•‡ Mensural numeral classifiers are entities which provide non-countable nouns with a countable
unit, such as one glass of water or a pound of butter. These kinds of classifiers basically give information
on how a non-countable noun is to be measured. This kind of classifier is found in most Â�
languages (in
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 173
relational classifiers the relation between the possessor and possessed is categorized
according to functional properties (whether the possessed item is to be eaten, sold,
grown, etc.). With possessed classifiers, the possessed item is characterized in some
way (in terms of animacy, physical properties, and so on). An extremely rare phenom-
enon in the world, so far known only in Dâw and possibly Hup (both Nadahup (Nada-
hup): Brazil), is the possessor classifiers, where the possessor is classified according to
animacy (Aikhenvald 2000:â•›139 citing Martins 1994 and Moore & Franklin 1979). Loca-
tive classifiers and deictic classifiers are also quite rare. Locative classifiers categorize
the head noun (according to physical properties and sometimes also animacy) in loca-
tive expressions. Deictic classifiers characterize the head noun (according to direction-
ality and position in space, physical properties, and so on) in deictic expressions, i.e.
with articles and demonstratives. Verbal classifiers appear on the verb but characterize
the noun, usually either in subject or object position, according to various semantic
properties (physical properties, position, and sometimes also animacy). For an acces-
sible overview of classifiers, including numerous examples, see Aikhenvald (2000).
The most common type of classifier is the numeral classifier. In Gil’s (2011) sample
of 400 languages 140 (35%) have numeral classifiers. In 62 languages (15.5% of the
entire sample) the numeral classifier is optional. An example of a language where
numeral classifiers are optional is Persian, as shown in Example (100).
		 Persian (Indo-European (Iranian): Iran)
	 (100)	 a.	 do(-ta)	 pesær
			 two-cl:fold	 boy
			 ‘two boys’
		 b.	 bist(-jeld)	 ketab
			 twenty-cl:volume	 book
			 ‘twenty books’  (Mahootian 1997:â•›195)
In Example (100) the classifiers â•‚ta ‘fold’ (used for any count noun) and â•‚jeld ‘volume’
(used for books) are suffixed to the numeral if used. However, the use is not obliga-
tory, as indicated by the parentheses.
In 78 (19.5%) of the languages in Gil’s sample the numeral classifier is obligatory.
This means that every time a noun is quantified with a numeral, there has to be a
classifier in the numerical noun phrase. An example of a language where numeral
classifiers are obligatory is Kambera. There are five classes, categorizing animacy and
shape, as shown in (101):
varying degrees of grammaticalized states). Sortal numeral classifiers, on the other hand, are those
classifiers that divide all nouns into semantic categories, irrespective of whether they are countable or
not. What I term ‘numeral classifier’ in this section thus refers to sortal numeral classifiers.
174	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Kambera (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia)
	 (101)	 wua/mbua	 round objects
		 pungu/mbungu	 oblong objects
		 wàla/mbàla	 flat, thin objects
		 iu/ngiu	 animals
		 tau	 humans  (Klamer 1998:â•›139)
When quantifying a noun one of these classifiers must be part of the numerical noun
phrase. Compare the following:
		 Kambera (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia)
	 (102)	 tailu	 mbua	 kajawa
		 three	 cl:round	 papayas	 ‘three papayas’
		 tailu	 mbungu	 pena
		 three	 cl:oblong	 pen	 ‘three pens’
		 tailu	 mbàla	 kapambal
		 three	 cl:flat&thin	 plank	 ‘three planks’
		 tailu	 ngiu	 kamambi
		 three	 cl:animal	 goat	 ‘three goats’ (Klamer 1998:â•›139)
In Example (102) the presence of a classifier is obligatory between the numeral and
the noun that is being quantified. The choice of the classifier depends on its semantic
characteristics, based on animacy and shape. Languages may have very large sets of
numeral classifiers; Chontal Maya (Mayan (Mayan): Mexico), for example, has over a
hundred (Suárez 1983:â•›88).
The languages in the APiCS sample exhibit much more radical figures than
those in the WALS sample. While in both samples the majority of languages lack
numeral classifiers, the figures differ in proportion. Recall that 35% of the languages
in Gil’s sample have numeral classifiers, most of which are spoken in South-East
Asia. This figure changes only very insignificantly to 35.2% if we take out the two
contact languages (Ndyuka and Chinese Pidgin Russian, both lacking classifiers) in
the sample and thus have 398 languages in total. In the APiCS, however, only four
of 76 languages (5.3%) have numeral classifiers: Ambon Malay (Creole (Malay-lexi-
fied): Indonesia), Chinese Pidgin English, Gullah (Creole (English-lexified): USA),
and Sri Lanka Portuguese.110 A full 94.7% lack them (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature
36). This means that pidgins and creoles seem less likely than non-creoles to have
numeral classifiers.
110.â•‡ Notice that two of these four languages are located in South East Asia.

7.1.3	 	 Case
Case is a “system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear
to their heads” (Blake 2001:â•›1). The term head refers to, very simplified, the central
element in the construction, i.e. the element that establishes the function of the entire
phrase. The head of the NP that big fluffy blanket is thus the noun blanket, since that is
the central element. Without it the phrase would not make sense (cf. *that big fluffy).
The head usually governs the dependent, i.e. the element that is somehow attached
to (dependent on) a head. The head of the noun is very often the verb of the clause or
sentence, but it may also be other elements, such as adpositions or other nouns. This
means that case is a grammatical way of overtly indicating what syntactic or seman-
tic relationship the noun or noun phrase has to some other element of the clause or
sentence within which it occurs. Traditionally case refers to various forms of morpho-
logical inflections on the NP, but it may also be argued that clitics and adpositions can
function as case markers. For a very thorough overview of case and various types of
case systems, see Blake (2001).
Languages differ as to how many and which kinds of cases they have. English has
only one overtly marked case, the genitive. A typical, but not exclusive, feature of case
systems is that they are paradigmatic. That means that the cases typically substitute
each other; in other words, either case A is used, or case B, or case C but not a com-
bination of more than one. The choice of which case to use depends on language-
dependent syntactic and/or semantic rules. It would be entirely beyond the scope of
this section to attempt to list the kinds of cases found throughout the world. However,
some common core (or grammatical) cases will be mentioned, as these will then be
particularly relevant for coming sections. It is very important here to keep in mind
that the uses listed for the cases are wide generalizations. None of the cases listed are
used exclusively for the functions given.
Many of us are familiar with the nominative case, which is typically used to mark
the grammatical relation of the subject of the verb in the clause. Very simplified the
subject can be thought of as the ‘doer’ of the action or the event. Examples of sub-
jects are, for instance, the man in [The man] danced or the girl in [The girl] bought [a
book]. The square brackets indicate which words form a single constituent (the unit
that forms the relevant syntactic building block – in this case the subject and object).
Notice that a constituent can consist of more than one word. The subjects in the sen-
tences above are thus the NPs theâ•›+â•›man and theâ•›+â•›girl. The accusative case is typically
used to mark the object in the clause, which, again very simplified, can be thought
of as the ‘goal’ or ‘receiver’ of an event or action. Examples of an object are a book in
the sentence above, or the lamp in [The boy] switched on [the lamp]. Sometimes two
objects are needed, as in The girl gave a book to her friend. To distinguish between the
two objects, the object that, very simplified, is the ‘recipient’ of the action or event is
176	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
labelled the indirect object. The dative case is often used to mark the indirect object.
For more on constituents, see Chapter 10.
The genitive case is very often used to mark possession. Another common case is
the ergative, which is typically used for the semantic role of agent. This is again very
simplified indeed and will be discussed further in Chapter 9. Examples of an agent
are the girl in The girl gave a book to her friend, or the boy in The boy switched on the
lamp. The ergative case is typically used to mark the subject of a transitive clause.111
Languages that have ergative case typically also have the absolutive case, which tends
to be used for the semantic role of patient. An example of a patient is the lamp in the
sentence above. Grammatical relations and semantic roles are not mutually exclusive:
thus the lamp in the sentence above is both the object and the patient in the clause.
This will be discussed further in Chapter 9. I stress again that the functions listed for
the cases are very general and vary a great deal from language to language.
Other kinds of cases may involve notions of location, such as locative (‘in/at X’),
adessive (‘near/by X’) or inessive (‘inside X’); or motion, such as ablative (‘from X’),
allative (‘to X’) or illative (‘into X’); or states, such as essive (“at rest/be in/at”, i.e. ‘at/
as X’) or abessive (‘without X’); or various other semantic roles, such as benefactive
(‘for X’) or comitative (‘with X’).
It is common in the world, however, to not have any cases at all. In Iggesen’s (2011)
sample of 261 languages, 100 (38.3%) lack case altogether. This is the largest group in
the sample. In these languages the various syntactic and semantic functions are ex-
pressed through other strategies, for example word order. English uses word order to
distinguish between the grammatical relations of subject and object; in The man saw
the girl the subject is the man and the object is the girl. If we swap the two NPs and
get The girl saw the man, the subject changes and is now the girl while the man is the
object. This is common among languages with small or no case systems. Due to the
fact that English has a genitive case (the ’s in, for example, the dog’s collar), English is
counted as having two cases in Iggesen’s database because of the paradigmatic con-
trast between the genitive and the unmarked form. There are 32 (12.3%) languages in
Iggesen’s sample such as English, which are counted as having small case systems.112
111.â•‡ A transitive clause is a clause where the verb demands two so-called arguments, which means
that the verb needs two central elements for the clause to make sense. For example the verb buy is
transitive in that someone has to buy something; a clause like *the man bought is ungrammatical.
The verb needs two arguments. For more on transitivity, see 9.1.3.2.
112.â•‡ I have modified Iggesen’s values somewhat, as follows: languages with small case systems
(Iggesen’s ‘languages with 2 case categories’ + ‘languages with 3 case categories’), languages with
medium-sized case systems (Iggesen’s ‘languages with 4 case categories’ + ‘languages with 5 case
categories’). The three remaining values, languages with large case systems (6–7 cases), languages
with very large cases systems (8–9 cases) and languages with extremely large case systems (10 cases
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 177
An example of a language listed as having three cases in Iggesen’s sample is Modern
Greek with nominative, accusative and genitive (Ruge 1984).113 The smallest group,
with 21 languages (8%), in Iggesen’s sample is that with medium-sized case inventories
of four or five cases. An example of a language with four cases is Kashmiri (Indo-
European (Indic): India), with nominative, ergative, dative and ablative (Wali & Koul
1997:â•›151). Ngiyambaa (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia) is an example of a lan-
guage with five cases: absolutive, ergative/instrumental, dative, locative and circum-
stantive (Donaldson 1980:â•›82). Most common among the languages that have cases is
to have a large inventory of six or seven cases; 37 (14.2%) languages of the sample fall
into this group. Turkish is an example of a language with six cases in its case system:
nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative and genitive (Kornfilt 2003:â•›212) and
Kannada is an example of a language with seven cases: nominative, accusative, geni-
tive, dative, locative, instrumental (‘with X’) and ablative (Sridhar 1990:â•›156). To have
very large case inventories (eight or nine cases) is not quite as rare as one might think
if one is mainly used to Western European languages: 23 (8.8%) languages display this
pattern. West Greenlandic has eight cases (Fortescue 1984:â•›206) and Udihe has nine
(Nikolaeva & Tolskaya 2001:â•›106), as shown in (103):
	 (103)	 West Greenlandic	 Udihe
		 (Eskimo-Aleut (Eskimo): Greenland)	 (Altaic (Tungusic): Russia)
		 absolutive	 -q/t/k/Ø	 nominative	 Ø
		 ergative114	 -(u)p	 accusative	 -wA
		 instrumental	 -mik	 dative	 -du
		 allative	 -mut	 allative115	 -tigi
		 locative	 -mi	 locative	 -lA
		 ablative	 -mit	 prolative	 -liâ•… (‘along/through X’)
		 prosecutive	 -kkut	 (‘through X’)	 ablative	 -digi
		 equative	 -tut	 (‘like, as X’)	 instrumental	 -zi
			 destinative	 -nA	(‘destined for
					 X/destination’)
It might come as a surprise that it actually is slightly more common to have extremely
large case systems: 24 (9.2%) languages in Iggesen’s sample have ten cases or more. An
example of a language with a very rich case system is Lezgian (Nakh-Daghestanian
or more) are adopted unchanged from Iggesen. Notice that Iggesen includes clitics and adpositions
as case markers provided that they show a certain degree of bondedness with the host noun.
113.â•‡ It should be noted that Iggesen does not count non-syntactic cases such as the vocative (used
to address someone), which in other interpretations would be the fourth case for Modern Greek.

178	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
(Lezgic): Russia) with 18 cases, four core (or grammatical cases) – absolutive, erga-
tive, dative and genitive – and 14 local cases (Haspelmath 1993:â•›74), as shown in (104).
Notice that the ergative suffix is combined with all cases except the absolutive, which
has no morphological marking. Notice also that the local cases divide neatly into five
groups of localizations (ad- ‘at’, post- ‘behind’, sub- ‘under’, super- ‘over/on’, and in-
‘in’) of three locatives each (essive ‘at rest’, elative ‘from’ and directive ‘towards’). The
last logical combination of inâ•›+â•›directive is lacking.

Nakh-Daghestanian languages are famous for their large case systems, but as with
Lezgian, the systems often form rather straightforward agglutinative combinations of
a limited set of markers. This is also what we find in the northern dialects of Tabas-
saran (Nakh-Daghestanian (Lezgic): Russia), which are reputed to have extremely
large case systems indeed, with as many as 53 cases (Comrie 1981c:â•›209, Comrie &
Polinsky 1998:â•›96). However, here too we have a limited set of markers of four core
cases (absolutive, ergative, genitive and dative) which may combine with eight loca-
tive or orientation markers and two motion markers (see Comrie & Polinsky 1998,
also for a demonstration on how languages with a rather limited amount of cases
can be claimed to have enormous case systems). Ugric languages are also famous for
their rich case systems; in fact the language that Iggesen (2011) lists as having the
most cases in his sample is Hungarian (Uralic (Ugric): Hungary), with 21 productive
cases, although analyses for Hungarian vary radically and can range from 17 to 28
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 179
(see Â�
Spencer 2008 for references and, above all, for a discussion that Hungarian lacks
a true case system, but that what look like case markers are actually ‘fused postposi-
tions’ similar to the French portmanteau du = de le ‘of the.m.sg’.)
The remaining languages in Iggesen’s sample, 24 (9.2%), are analysed by Iggesen
as having exclusively borderline case marking, by which he means that core (or gram-
matical) case is not marked, while such semantic notions as location or instrument
are marked.
The vast majority of languages with case systems mark their cases through suf-
fixation. In Dryer’s (2011t) sample of 1032 languages, 653 (63.3%) have case marking.
Of these, a full 452 (69.2% of the languages with case) mark cases through suffixation.
West Greenlandic, Udihe and Lezgian are all examples of languages with suffixing
case markers, as shown above. While case marking through prefixing is rare, it can be
found in 38 languages (5.8% of the languages with case) in Dryer’s sample. An exam-
ple of a language with prefixing case markers is Gapapaiwa where kuâ•‚ ‘to’ (locativeÂ�
)
is prefixed on the noun:
		 Gapapaiwa (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
	 (105)	 ta-rui	 ku-vao
		 1incl:pl-go.in	 to-garden
		 ‘We will go into the garden.’  (McGuckin 2002:â•›314)
The second most common strategy in Dryer’s sample, found in 123 languages (18.8%
of the languages in the sample with case) is to have postpositional clitics – recall that
clitics are units that are phonetically bound, but that are syntactically independent of
their host. An example of a postpositional case marker is â•‚ṛa ‘locative’ in Ungarinjin:
		 Ungarinjin (Australian (Wororan): Australia)
	 (106)	 [dambun	 ŋininga]=ṛa
		 camp		 my=loc
		 ‘at my camp’  (Rumsey 1978:â•›85)
In Example (106) the locative case marker is placed at the end of the whole NP, even
though the last word of the NP is not the noun. A few languages in Dryer’s sample –
18 (2.8% of the languages with case) to be precise – use prepositional clitics to mark
case, such as Cayuvava.
		 Cayuvava (Isolate: Bolivia)
	 (107)	 ji=[ka’reeča	 datï]
		 obl=other	 place
		 ‘in another place’  (Dryer 2011t citing Key 1967:â•›51)
180	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (107) the oblique case marker jiâ•‚ cliticizes to the first word of the NP, even if that
is not the noun. Extremely rare is to have case marking inpositional clitics, which is
found in only seven languages (1.1% of the languages with case) in Dryer’s sample. An
example of such a language is Anindilyakwa:
		 Anindilyakwa (Australian (Anindilyakwa): Australia)
	 (108)	 ampwarriya	 [arimwa=mwantja	 aka]116
		 2sg.sit	 3:4.big=loc	 3:4.tree
		 ‘Sit next to the big tree!’  (Leeding 1989:â•›308)
In Example (108) the locative case marker â•‚mwantja cliticizes onto the first word of
the noun phrase, in this case the adjective. Notice that this kind of construction was
listed as an inposition in Dryer (2011i); cf. Example (72) above), showing that the
boundary between case and adpositions is a fuzzy one.
Another extremely rare strategy is to mark case through tone; this is found in
only five languages (0.8% of the languages with case) in Dryer’s sample: Jamsay
(NigerÂ�
-Congo (Dogon): Mali), Maasai, Maba (Nilo-Saharan (Maban): Chad), Nandi
and Shilluk (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Sudan). The Agar dialect of Dinka, which is not
in Dryer’s sample, also marks case through tone only.
		 Agar Dinka (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Sudan)
	 (109)	 a.	 bá̤ɲ		 à̰-tò̰oc	 d̪ɔ̤̀ɔk
			 chief.abs	 decl-send	 boy
			 ‘The chief is sending the boy.’
		 b.	 d̪ɔ̤̀ɔk	 à̰-tó̰oc	 bà̤ɲ
			 boy	 decl-send.pass	 chief.obl
			 ‘The boy is being sent by the chief.’  (Andersen 2002:â•›7)
In Example (109) above the only difference between ‘chief’ in the absolutive and the
oblique case is the tone: bá̤ɲ versus bà̤ɲ. Even more rare is to mark case through stem
change in the noun, a strategy found in only one language (0.2% of the languages with
case) in Dryer’s sample, Nuer. Example (110) from Nuer shows how stem change is the
only way of differentiating between nominative and genitive case.
		 Nuer (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Ethiopia, Sudan)
	 (110)	 ‘cow’	 nom.sg	 yaŋ	 ‘drum’	 nom.sg	 bul
			 gen.sg	 yaaŋ		 gen.sg	 buɔ̱ɔ̱l (Wright 1999:â•›85)
116.â•‡ The notation 3:4 indicates noun class. The 3:4 noun class in Anindilyakwa categorizes “invisible
items and items with a lustrous appearance (animate and inanimate)” (Leeding 1989:â•›229).
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 181
In the example above the only difference between the cases is in the change of
stem through either mere lengthening (yaŋ versus yaaŋ) or through diphthongation
(bul versus buɔ̱ɔ̱l).
Finally, eight languages (1.3% of the languages with case) in Dryer’s sample ex-
hibit a mixed strategy, combining at least two of the suffixing, prefixing, tonal or stem
change methods for coding case.
7.2	 NP syntax
We have seen that NPs may consist minimally of a noun or a substitute for a noun
(such as a pronoun), but that they may also consist of several words that together
form a constituent unit. In the latter case there is typically a core or main element, a
head, which the other elements in the phrase, the dependent(s), relate to one way or
another. We have also seen that the elements in an NP may be marked for various cat-
egories, such as number, gender or class, and case. Several words that belong together
in an NP may be overtly marked to show that they belong together; they agree with
each other formally.117 The whole NP can in turn be a dependent to a head outside the
NP, such as a verb or a preposition. These heads outside the NP may determine which
form the NP requires; they govern the NP.
7.2.1	 	 Heads and dependents
When several elements combine to form a unit, there is typically some kind of syn-
tactic relation between them in the sense that there is an organization by which one
element forms the core of the unit which the other units relate to. For instance in the
NP unit John’s book, the core element of the phrase, the head, is book, while the de-
pendent element is John’s, since the NP John’s book refers to a specific book and not a
specific John. In the NP red flower the head of the phrase is flower and the dependent
is red, since we are talking about a kind of flower (a red one) and not a kind of red (a
flowery one). This is also true for longer phrases, such as the king of Sweden’s crown,
where crown is the head and the king of Sweden is the dependent (we are talking about
a specific crown and not a specific king of Sweden). A phrase can also have an adposi-
tion as its head, with the various objects of the adposition being the dependents. These
kinds of phrases are, unsurprisingly, called adpositional phrases – in English we have
prepositional phrases (PPs), since the adpositions of English are prepositions. An ex-
ample of an adpositional phrase is from the red house, where the preposition from is
117.â•‡ While the controller of agreement is usually a nominal, other elements may also show agree-
ment, such as elements in aVP showing agreement for tense, mood and/or aspect.
182	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the head and the NP the red house is the dependent (which then, in turn, has its own
inner syntax of heads and dependents).118
Languages differ as to whether they overtly mark this syntax or not. The less mor-
phological marking a language makes use of, the more likely it will be that head and
dependent syntax will be unmarked. Notice, however, that languages may mark some
kinds of relationship morphologically, while others remain unmarked. English is an
example of this, where possessive phrases are marked with the genitive ’s (e.g. John’s
book), while attributive phrases and adpositional phrases are unmarked (e.g. red flow-
er and from the house respectively). Languages also differ as to whether the relation-
ship is marked on the head or on the dependent or both.119
English is an example of a dependent marking language in possessive phrases,
where the possessor and not the possessed noun carries the marker: John in John’s
book is the possessor while book is the possessed noun. An example of a head mark-
ing language is Fijian:
		 Fijian (Austronesian (Oceanic): Fiji)
	 (111)	 a		 liga-i		 Jone
		 art		 hand-poss	 PN
		 ‘John’s hand’  (Dixon 1988:â•›120)
In (111) the possessive marker â•‚i suffixes to the possessed noun (the head) liga ‘hand’
and not the possessor (the dependent) Jone ‘John’. An example of a double marking
language, i.e. a language that marks both the head and the dependent, is Turkish:
		 Turkish (Altaic (Turkic): Turkey)
	 (112)	 Ayşe-nin	 araba-sı
		 PN-gen	 car-3sg
		 ‘Ayşe’s car’ (lit. ‘Ayşe’s his-car’)  (Kornfilt 1990:â•›633)
118.â•‡ The binary opposition of head and dependent carries over to other and larger units too. For
instance, the inner organization of verb phrases (VPs) is that the auxiliary verb is the head and
the lexical (or main) verb is the dependent (see Chapter 8 for more on VPs). On a higher level,
the predicate (usually the verb) is the head of the clause, while the arguments and adjuncts are the
dependents (see further Chapters 9 and 10). Likewise, the main-clause predicate is the head of the
sentence while the subordinate clauses are the dependents (see further Chapter 11).
119.â•‡ There are various other possibilities too, one example being free (or floating) marking, where
the marker always has a certain position in the phrase irrespective of where the head or dependent
are located (for instance, a linker clitic that always attaches to the first word of the phrase, irrespec-
tive of what word that is, the so-called Wackernagel position.).
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 183
In (112) both the possessed noun (the head) araba ‘car’ and the possessor (the depen-
dent) Ayşe carry overt marking. Indonesian is an example of a language with no mark-
ing at all in possessive phrases, but where simple juxtaposition (that the elements are
placed next to each other) suffices, as Example (113) shows.
		 Indonesian (Austronesian (Sundic): Indonesia)
	 (113)	 rumah	 Tomo
		 house	 PN
		 ‘Tomo’s house’  (Sneddon 1996:â•›144)
In their sample of 236 languages, Nichols & Bickel (2011a) found that 98 (41.5%) of
the languages were dependent marking, like English, while 78 (33.1%) languages were
head marking, like Fijian, and 22 (9.3%) were double marking, like Turkish. A few lan-
guages, six to be precise (2.5%), had other kinds of strategies while 32 (13.6%) lacked
any kind of marking and simply juxtaposed the two elements.
As mentioned, attributive phrases, containing a noun and one or several modi-
fying adjectives, may also be either head or dependent marking. An example of a
dependent marking language in attributive phrases is Chechen, where an agreement
prefix is placed on the adjective (the dependent) to show agreement with the covert
gender class noun (the head):
		 Chechen (Nakh-Daghestanian (Nakh): Russia)
	 (114)	 a.	 d-ovxa	 xi	 b.	 j-ovxa	 šura
			 agr-hot	 water		 agr-hot	 milk
			 ‘hot water’				 ‘hot milk’  (Nichols 1986:â•›61)
In Example (114a) the agreement prefix dâ•‚ indicates the covert gender class of the
noun xi ‘water’ and is placed on the adjective (the dependent) ovxa ‘hot’; the noun it-
self (the head) remains unmarked. With a ‘covert gender class’ I mean that the gender
is not overtly expressed, even though it is part of the inherent semantics of the noun,
as the adjective agreement shows. When the adjective modifies a noun of a different
gender class, as in (114b), the prefix changes accordingly (in this case to jâ•‚).
An example of a head marking language in attributive phrases is Shuswap, where
the marker for oblique case (called the relative case for this language) is placed on the
noun (the head) and not the adjective (the dependent), as shown in Example (115).
		 Shuswap (Salishan (Interior Salish): Canada)
	 (115)	 wist	 t-citx
		 high	 rel-house
		 ‘high house’  (Nichols 1986:â•›61)
184	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In the example above the adjective (the dependent) wist ‘high’ is unmarked while the
noun (the head) citx ‘house’ carries a relative (oblique) case marker.
Adpositional phrases may also be either head or dependent marking. An exam-
ple of a dependent marking language for adpositional phrases is German, where the
preposition wegen ‘because.of’ requires the genitive case:
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (116)	 wegen	 Regen-s	 wurde	 das	 Spiel	 unterbrochen
		 because.of	 rain-gen	 aux.past	 def	 game	 suspend.ptcpl
		 ‘Because of rain the game was suspended.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In the adpositional phrase in (116), wegen Regens ‘because.of rain’, the marker is on the
noun (the dependent) Regen ‘rain’ while the preposition (the head) wegen ‘because.
of’ remains unmarked.120 An example of a head marking language in adpositional
phrases is Tzutujil:
		 Tzutujil (Mayan (Mayan): Guatemala)

7.2.2	 	 Government and agreement
We have seen that several elements can be linked to form one syntactic unit, and
that there may be some kind of binary organization to these elements in that one
is the head and the other(s) is (or are) the dependent(s). In morphologically com-
plex languages this linkage can be one of agreement (also termed concord), in which
case the dependents take a morphological shape that corresponds to that of the head
(or, more accurately, the controller determines the form of the target, see below). In
other words, if the head has the inherent semantics of ‘maleâ•›+â•›singularâ•›+â•›nominative’
then the dependents must also take the form ‘maleâ•›+â•›singularâ•›+â•›nominative’ in order
to show that they form a unit with the head. Similarly, if the head has the inherent
semantics of ‘femaleâ•›+â•›pluralâ•›+â•›genitive’ then the dependents must also take the shape
120.â•‡ This example represents rather formal language. More common would be to include the article
in the construction, as in wegen des Regens (because.of art.m.sg.gen rain-gen).
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 185
that signals ‘femaleâ•›+â•›pluralâ•›+â•›genitive’. The crucial thing about agreement is that the
dependents vary in shape systematically according to the semantics of the head. The
linkage between elements in a unit can alternatively be one of government, in which
case the head determines the morphological shape of the dependents (or, more ac-
curately, where the governor determines the shape of the governee, see below), but
where the shape of the dependents does not give any information about any inherent
semantics of the head. For example, an adposition might govern the genitive case, as
in Example (116) above, but the fact that the dependents are in the genitive gives no
particular information about the inherent semantics of the adposition.
Patterns of agreement vary greatly cross-linguistically and it would be beyond the
scope of this section to give anything more than a brief overview of the most proto-
typical examples. For a very thorough introduction to agreement, see Corbett (2006).
The element that triggers agreement, the controller, is typically a nominal, while the
elements whose form is determined by the controller, the targets, may be of different
sorts but are prototypically adjectives or verbs. The features involved in agreement are
typically gender, number and person. Consider the Italian example below:
		 Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italy)
	 (118)	 a.	 il	 libr-o	 piccol-o
			 def.m.sg	 book-m.sg	 small-m.sg
			 ‘the small book’
		 b.	 i	 libr-i	 piccol-i
			 def.m.pl	 book-m.pl	 small-m.pl
			 ‘the small books’
		 c.	 la	 cas-a	 piccol-a
			 def.f.sg	 house-f.sg	 small-f.sg
			 ‘the small house’
		 d.	 le	 cas-e	 piccol-e
			 def.f.pl	 house-f.pl	 small-f.pl
			 ‘the small houses’  (source: personal knowledge)
In Example (118) the definite article as well as the adjective, the targets, systematically
change shape according to the noun, the controller. If the controller is a masculine
noun, as libro ‘book(m)’ is, the targets have to be in a masculine form and if the con-
troller is a feminine noun, as casa ‘house(f)’ is, the targets have to be in a feminine
form. If the controller is in the singular, then the targets are also in the singular, and if
the controller is in the plural, then so are the targets.
Example (118) shows a typical target type, the adjective. Another typical target
within the clause (as opposed to within the phrase) is the verb, which often agrees in
person and number with the subject, as is the case in French.
186	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 French (Indo-European (Romance): France)
	 (119)	 a.	 Jean	 aim-e	 les	 chat-s
			 PN		 love-3sg	 art	 cat-pl
			 ‘Jean loves cats.’
		 b.	 nous	 aim-ons	 Jean
			 1pl		 love-1pl	 PN
			 ‘We love Jean.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In Example (119) the target, the verb aimer ‘love’, is inflected for the person and num-
ber of the subject: if the subject is in the third person singular, this is signalled on the
verb through a third person singular affix. If the subject changes in person or number,
then the affix must also change.
Other targets may be pronouns, numerals, adverbs, adpositions, complementiz-
ers, coordinating conjunctions, particles and other nouns. For examples and discus-
sion, see Corbett (2006).
While with agreement the feature specification of the targets are determined by
the feature specifications of the controllers, with government the feature specification
of the governed element (the governee) is determined merely by the presence of the
governing element (the governor): “the governing member [i.e. the governor] im-
poses specific restrictions on the morphosyntactic properties of the governed mem-
ber [i.e. the governee], but does so without (necessarily) sharing any of its properties”
(Stump 1998:â•›24). In other words, the governor does not (necessarily) have the inher-
ent semantic content that the shape of the governee indicates. While nominals are the
typical controllers for agreement and targets can vary, the opposite is true for govern-
ment: the governor can be of different kinds but the governee is typically a nominal.
The feature involved in government is typically case.
We have seen that adpositions may govern case (the preposition wegen ‘because.
of’ governing the genitive in Example (116) above). This is also the true for Khwarshi,
where postpositions govern different cases in the NP. For example žoqu’uža ‘behind’
governs the genitive-2 case, gił ‘under’ governs the interessive or subessive case and
roq’ihol ‘according to’ governs the subessive case, as shown in Example (120):
		 Khwarshi (Nakh-Daghestanian (Avar-Andic-Tsezic): Russia)
	 (120)	 a.	 anc-ma-la	 žoqu’uža
			 door-obl-gen2	 behind
			 ‘behind the door’
		 b.	 łe-ł	 gił
			 water.obl-inter	 under
			 ‘in the water’
		 c.	 q’ut’i-λ’o	 roq’ihol
			 deal-sub	 according.to
			 ‘according to the deal’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›134–5,â•›140)
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 187
Verbs also commonly govern case. In Modern Greek, for example, most direct objects
are in the accusative case, but with some verbs, such as ftano ‘suffice’, the direct object
is in the genitive.
		 Modern Greek (Indo-European (Greek): Greece)
	 (121)	 tis	 gynaikas	 ftanei	 to	 psomi
		 def.f.sg.gen	 woman.sg.gen	 suffice.3sg	 def.m.sg.nom	 bread
		 ‘The bread is enough for the woman.’  (adapted from Ruge 1984:â•›107)
government of agreement
In the Germanic languages two paradigms for adjective inflection were developed,
the ‘strong’ one and the ‘weak’ one. This distinction has been lost in English due to
the loss of inflectional morphology, but can still be seen clearly in German (Indo-
European (Germanic): Germany). It is also still present in the Scandinavian languages.
In the strong paradigm we have the forms distinguishing between singular and plu-
ral number, four cases and three genders (in the singular only), shown in Table 7.9.
Notice that the strong form paradigm has 16 cells but only five distinct forms. The
weak paradigm has the forms shown in Table 7.10.

The five distinct forms have
been reduced to two in
Â�
Table 7.10. In German there is
also a mixed paradigm which
shares some endings from the
strong paradigm and some
from the weak, with a total of
four distinct forms. The adjec-
tive must agree with the noun
according to one of these par-
adigms. The choice of para-
digm is governed by the
presence and kind of deter-
miner. If there is no determin-
er, the strong paradigm is
used; however, as soon as a
determiner carries any case
marking, the weak paradigm is used (the mixed paradigm is used with those deter-
miners that vary with respect to overt case marking). In other words, we have agree-
ment with adjectives, but the choice of paradigm for that agreement is an instance
of government.
188	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In Example (121) the subject is psomi ‘bread’ and is in the nominative, as would be
expected. However, the object, tis gynaikas ‘the woman’, is not in the accusative, which
is the usual case for expressing direct objects in Modern Greek, but in the genitive.
The noun phrase ‘the woman’, which constitutes the object here, the governee, is in the
genitive due to the verb, the governor. In Russian the numerals ‘two’, ‘three’ and ‘four’
govern the genitive case and singular number:
		 Russian (Indo-European (Slavic): Russia)
	 (122)	 dva/tri/četyre	 žurnal-a
		 two/three/four	 magazine-sg.gen
		 ‘two/three/four magazines’  (adapted from Corbett 1993:â•›13)
In (122) the noun, the governee, is governed by the numeral, the governor, to take the
genitive case and singular number. The numeral itself is in the nominative.121
7.3	 Nominal categories and syntax in sign languages
As with spoken languages, signed languages have means for expressing more of the
same. Nouns may either be unmarked for number, transnumeral (or have general
number, see above), or they may contrast between singular and plural, in which case
the plural is typically marked through reduplication. For instance, the plural form of
DGS HOUSE is to repeat the sign three times (simple reduplication) while the plural
for PERSON is to repeat the sign sidewards three times (sideward reduplication), as
shown in Figure 7.2 below.122
Not all nouns can be reduplicated, in which case they remain unmarked for num-
ber. It seems common for sign languages to have phonological restrictions on which
nouns can take reduplication, although the restrictions vary across languages. In
DGS, for example, body-anchored signs (where the place of articulation involves a
part of the body, such as the head or the non-dominant arm or hand) and signs with
complex movements cannot be reduplicated. It would be ungrammatical to repeat the
sign for DOCTOR or CAR in Figure 7.3 in an effort to express pluralization.
121.â•‡ In actuality the situation is much more complex: the numeral needs to agree with the noun for
gender, but since Russian only distinguishes for gender in the singular, the noun has to be in the
singular. So while the numeral governs the case and number for the noun, and as such is the gover-
nor of the noun, the noun in turn controls the gender of the numeral, which makes the numeral a
target for the noun. This is termed ‘collaborative agreement’ by Corbett (2006:â•›85). For more on the
complexities of Russian numerals, see Corbett (1993).
122.â•‡ Strictly speaking this is actually triplication, which is perceptually less ambiguous for the
non-signer.
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 189
It is also common for sign languages to restrict plural marking to NPs lacking any
other kind of quantifier. For instance something like *MANY/TWO HOUSE++123,
where the quantifier MANY or the numeral TWO are part of the NP, would not be
grammatical in DGS. In LIS, on the other hand, the co-occurrence of a quantifier does
not block plural inflection (Pizzuto & Corazza 1996:â•›184). Some sign languages lack
plural inflection for nouns altogether. In ST, for example, nouns remain unmarked for
number (Ahlgren & Bergman 2006:â•›29).
Many sign languages have more number values in their pronominal systems. The
dual, for instance, is common across sign languages, and some, like Jordanian Sign
123.â•‡ ‘+’ indicates each reduplication of the sign. ‘++’ thus means that the sign has been performed
three times (once for the gloss and once for each ‘+’).

190	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Language (LIU: Jordan) may even specify for three (trial), four (quadral) and five
(quintuple). This is done indexically, where the number of fingers extended specifies
the number of referents meant.
Sign languages do not tend to have grammatical gender or noun classes. However,
as we have seen (5.3), classifiers are very common indeed. As mentioned, these clas-
sifiers modify the verb they occur with and are better thought of as ‘verbal classifiers’
and not noun classifiers, as they do not categorize a type of noun, but specify semantic
properties of the argument(s).
Case marking is also a minor phenomenon in sign languages. One exception is
the genitive suffix in Auslan, as in MOTHER-gen SISTER-gen HUSBAND ‘mother’s
sister’s husband’ (Johnston 2006:â•›325). This suffix, however, is only limited to a few
lexical items and is not obligatory. To express possession simply by juxtaposition
(MOTHER SISTER instead of MOTHER-gen SISTER), as is common in most sign
languages, is equally grammatical (Johnston & Schembri 2009:â•›140).
Juxtaposition of elements that belong together in a phrasal unit is a common
strategy for sign languages, especially for NPs; inflectional morphology is predomi-
nantly found in the VP. Thus, as mentioned, possession is commonly expressed by
simply placing the two elements next to each other. While this is also found in spoken
languages, it is not as common as in signed languages (see 7.2.1 above).
Due to the fact that most inflectional morphology is found in the VP and not the
NP in sign languages, there is relatively little agreement in NPs. In DGS, for example,
if an NP contains a noun and a modifying adjective, plural marking will be indicated
on the noun only and not the adjective, which, incidentally, makes DGS a head-mark-
ing language. Thus BOOK++ GOOD ‘good books’ is grammatical while *BOOK++
GOOD++ is not. This is also true for ASL and ISL (Pfau & Steinbach 2006b:â•›171).
However, in other sign languages, such as NGT, ÖGS, LIS and Hausa Sign Language
(HSL: Nigeria), number agreement on the adjective is an optional possibility (Pfau
& Steinbach 2006b:â•›171 with further references). Notice that the plural marking on
nouns is often blocked if a numeral or other kind of quantifier is part of the NP. In
other words, plurality is often only expressed once in an NP, either through a quanti-
fier or through (usually optional) plural marking on the noun. In LIU, for example,
the NP ‘three deaf boys’ is signed BOY DEAF THREE (Hendriks 2008:â•›69).
	 7.4	 Summary
Nouns and noun phrases tend to be subcategorized according to various criteria. Noun phrases
may be coded for number, obligatorily or optionally. Number values vary, but the contrast sin-
gular versus plural is most commonly found.The associative plural does not indicate number for
an entity (usually a human), but that someone else is attached to that entity.
	 Chapter 7.â•‡ Nominal categories and syntax	 191
Noun phrases are often categorized into different genders or noun classes, usually according
to a system based on semantic criteria. Languages vary radically as to how many genders they
have, from none at all to up to 20. Classifiers should not be confused with noun class, as they are
free and invariant forms that assign nouns to a given noun class.
Nouns phrases may have an overt marking for the syntactic relationship between constitu-
ents: case markers, found in a great deal of languages in the world. Languages vary as to how
many cases they have, ranging from no cases at all to more than 20.
Noun phrases containing several elements usually have an internal syntax where one ele-
ment is the head, while the other elements are the dependents of the head. Languages vary as to
whether the various markers are coded on the head or the dependent(s). Agreement is when the
dependents vary in shape systematically according to the semantics of the head. Government is
when the mere presence of the head determines a certain shape of the dependent, irrespective
of the semantics of the head.
Sign languages may also mark their noun phrases for number, typically plural for nouns but
more values for pronouns. Plural is typically marked though reduplication and is not necessarily
obligatory. Gender or noun class and case play very minor roles in sign languages. Classifiers are
prolific, but belong to the verb phrase rather than the noun phrase. Sign languages vary with
respect to agreement in attributive phrases.

Verbal categories
Some of the most important verbal categories are tense, aspect and mood. Tense
locates an event on a timeline, while aspect specifies the perspective taken on an
event. Mood and modality code the attitude of the speaker towards a given proposi-
tion. While there are many other verb phrase operations to be found in and across
languages, this chapter deals specifically with tense, mood and aspect. In 8.2 I give an
overview of the major categories of tense, contrasting absolute versus relative tense,
also mentioning remoteness. Section 8.3 gives a brief sketch of the perfect. In 8.4
I discuss aspect and its various subcategories, and contrast it with Aktionsart or ac-
tionality. Section 8.5 brings up mood and modality, where I first contrast realis with
irrealis mood, then mention some different kinds of modalities. Section 8.6 gives an
overview of the more common tense, aspect and mood or modality systems found
in sign languages.
8.1	 A very brief introductory note on the VP
Just as the noun phrase can consist of several elements that form a unit, so can the
verb phrase (VP). Minimally the verb phrase consists of one word, a verb. Thus the
sentence The kangaroo jumped contains one noun phrase (The kangaroo) and one verb
phrase (jumped). However, a sentence like The kangaroo should have been jumping
also only contains one noun phrase (The kangaroo) and one verb phrase (should have
been jumping), even though the latter consists of several elements. Furthermore, in
both sentences The kangaroo jumped and The kangaroo should have been jumping the
verb phrases contains the same basic semantic content, that of the action JUMP. This
is because both verb phrases contain the same lexical verb, or ‘main’ verb. It is the lexi-
cal verb that carries the semantic content of the verb phrase, the basic meaning of the
event or action. The remaining elements in the verb phrase (should have been) in the
sentence above are auxiliary verbs (cf. 6.2.2.5). These tend to be semantically empty
and mainly convey grammatical or functional information.124
124.â•‡ Later we will see that a verb phrase may be argued to contain yet other elements, namely nomi-
nal constituents (cf. Chapter 10).
194	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Some very important verbal grammatical categories are tense, mood and aspect
(TMA), all of which are interrelated one way or another.125 Tense and aspect are both
categories that deal with time in various ways, while mood deals with assertions about
propositions. The traditional definition of the differences between the three is suc-
cinctly put in Chung & Timberlake (1985:â•›202):
Tense, aspect, and mood are all categories that further specify or characterize the ba-
sic predication, which can be referred to as the event. Tense locates the event in time.
Aspect characterizes the internal temporal structure of the event. Mood describes the
actuality of the event in terms such as possibility, necessity, or desirability.
While these categories per definition blend into each other, as shall be seen, I will deal
with them in turn. I stress, however, that this should not be taken to mean that these
categories are clearly defined against each other. On the contrary, it is very common
that grammatical markers denote a combination of two or more of the TMA catego-
ries. It would be beyond the scope of this chapter discuss the full range of complexi-
ties involved with TMA. The following sections will only highlight the main defining
points for each category. For a very thorough discussion on various TMA categories
and especially their origins, see Bybee et al. (1994). For a recent and accessible article-
length overview on the typology of TMA, see de Haan (2010).
8.2	 Tense
Tense is, very simplistically, a grammatical way for placing an event at a particular
point in time. In other words, tense is the linguistic device used to indicate when an
event took place. It is important to note here that tense refers to a grammatical cat-
egory of markers used (often obligatorily) to locate an event on a timeline, and not to
lexical items and expressions (such as yesterday or at five o’clock), which tend to be op-
tional and context dependent. For instance, the suffix â•‚ed in Yesterday I walked home
is a past tense marker, whereas yesterday is not, even though they both can be said to
place an event in the past on a timeline. However, the past marker â•‚ed is obligatory;
*yesterday I walk home is not grammatical in (Standard) English, while a sentence
125.	TMA is actually not restricted to the verb and verb phrases only, but can also be found as an
inflectional category for nominals and other NP elements, as shown in Nordlinger & Sadler (2004
and subsequent). Of the 22 languages mentioned in Nordlinger & Sadler, most can be found in
South America, but a handful are spread over sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and northern USA. The
tense dependent demonstratives of Chamicuro mentioned below are an example of nominal tense.
For further details, examples and references, see Nordlinger & Sadler (2004), but cf. also Tonhauser
(2007) for a discussion on Guaraní specifically, challenging the interpretation of a nominal tense
category there.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 195
like I walked home, without the adverbial yesterday, is grammatically acceptable. For
thorough discussions on tense, see Comrie (1985) and Dahl (1985), both of which are
classics by now.
There are two conceptually different ways of expressing when something happened:
to either relate the event to a given reference point (relative tense), or to relate it to the
moment of speech (absolute tense). Each of these strategies will be discussed below.
If we imagine a timeline on which to place an event, a crucial concept is the pres-
ent moment, the Now, as in Figure 8.1.
Now
Figure 8.1â•‡ Timeline specifying only Now.
It is important to keep in mind here that the concept of Now lies with the narrator
or the individual performing the speech act. Thus we often have the option to have a
fictive Now, where we, in identifying with a character of a story, transpose a Now to
something imagined. A minimal tense contrast would then be Now versus not-Now.
This kind of system, which in essence lumps together the past and the future into
one category, is as yet not known in any language of the world.126 However, there are
languages with a bipartite tense distinction, either before-Now versus not-before-Now
(past versus nonpast) or after-Now versus not-after-Now (future versus nonfuture).
An example of a past/nonpast system can be found in Harar Oromo:
		 Harar Oromo (Afro-Asiatic (Eastern Cushitic): Ethiopia)
	 (123)	 a.	 inníi	 magaláa	 deem-e
			 3sg.m	 market	 go-past
			 ‘He went to the market.’
		 b.	 inníi	 magaláa	 deem-a
			 3sg.m	 market	 go-npst
			 ‘He goes/is going/will go to the market.’  (Owens 1985:â•›83)127
While the sentence in Example (123a) is unambiguously in the past, the suffix â•‚a in
(123b) does not specify whether the person is going to the market now or will go later,
but only that we are not referring to the past. An example of a language with a future/
nonfuture system is Kolyma Yukaghir:
126.â•‡ Yagua, however, has seven tense categories, two of which essentially do lump together the past
and the future: proximate-1 and proximate-2 (Payne 1985a). However, they are not the only tenses
of the language. See further below.
127.â•‡ The suffix â•‚a in (123b) is glossed ‘imperfect’ in the source.
196	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Kolyma Yukaghir (Yukaghir (Yukaghir): Russia)
	 (124)	 a.	 terikie-die	 iŋd’e-t	 modo-j
			 old.woman-dim	 sew-ss.ipfv	 sit-intr.3sg
			 ‘The old woman is/was sitting and sewing.’
		 b.	 met	 qanin+ere	 kel-te-je
			 I	 when+indef	 come-fut-intr.1sg
			 ‘I will come one day.’  (Maslova 2003:â•›168f)
In Example (124a) we have no way of knowing, outside context, whether the event is
currently taking place or whether it took place in the past, but in (124b) the event is
unambiguously in the future.
Languages may contrast between both before-Now and after-Now, in which case
we also get a specific simultaneous-to-Now value. English is an example of a language
with a tripartite tense contrast of past (before-Now) versus present (simultaneous-to-
Now) versus future (after-Now). I stress again that this refers to grammatical catego-
ries, not semantic expressions. A language may well be able to express that an event
took place in the past, is taking place now, or will be taking place in the future, without
having specifically grammaticalized categories for locating events in time.
tense dependent demonstratives
Chamicuro (Arawakan (Arawakan): Peru) has two clitic particles
that function as demonstratives and that contrast for tense,
â•‚na, used for nonpast contexts and â•‚ka, used for past contexts:
p-aškalaˀt-ís-na	 čamálo
2-kill-2pl-def	 bat
‘You (pl) are killing the bat.’
p-aškalaˀt-ís-ka	 čamálo
2-kill-2pl-def	 bat
‘You (pl) killed the bat.’ (Parker 1999:â•›553)
There are also languages without any tense category, where the event is, if needed,
located in time through time adverbials or other such strategies. Languages with very
little grammatical marking tend to belong to this group. An example of a language
without tense is Ju|’hoan.
		 Ju|’hoan (Khoisan (Northern Khoisan): Angola, Namibia, Botswana)
	 (125)	 ha	 úá	 Tjùm!kúí
		 3sg	 go	 Tsumkwe
		 ‘He went/goes/will go to Tsumkwe.’  (Dickens n.y.:â•›5)
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 197
The sentence in (125) cannot be unambiguously translated into English with-
out further context, because English, as opposed to Ju|’hoan, must specify for tense.
In other words, without further context than this, all three English translations are
equally valid.
For those of us who are used to a tripartite tense system, it might seem highly
exotic to have fewer or even none of the values past/present/future. In a pilot survey
of 211 languages based on the 222 languages on Östen Dahl’s and my tense maps in
WALS (Dahl & Velupillai 2011c, Dahl & Velupillai 2011b), I mapped languages as fol-
lows: (i) no category tense; (ii.a) past tense exists, but not future tense; (ii.b) future
tense exists but not past tense; (iii) both past and future tense exist.128 While the re-
sults in a pilot study are always to be seen as preliminary, they may still serve as a
general indication of possible patterns. I found that the majority falls into category
(iii), both of the category (ii) values taken together make up a third of the sample,
while the smallest group of languages fall into category (i). Table 8.1 summarizes the
findings and Map 8.1 shows the patterns.
Table 8.1â•‡ Pilot survey of tense values.
feature value â•⁄ # â•⁄ %
i no tense â•⁄ 24 11.4
ii.a past but no future â•⁄ 15 â•⁄ 7.1
ii.b future but no past â•⁄ 58 27.6
iii both past and future 113 53.8
210
As Table 8.1 shows, about one tenth of the languages in the survey lack a specific
tense category, while about a third have either a specific past tense or a specific future
tense. Of the languages in group (ii), it is five times more common to have a future
tense but not a specific past tense than the other way about. One might postulate that
this could be due to a realis/irrealis dichotomy; it might be more common to need a
specific marker for the future since the future has not happened yet and thus belongs
to an unreal (irrealis) world, while the past and present both belong to the real world
(realis). See 8.5.1 for more on realis and irrealis.
The majority of the languages in the survey have both a past and a future tense.
Due to an Indo-European bias, it is likely that the picture is skewed in favour of the
group (iii) languages. As can be seen on Map 8.1, Australia and the Eurasian landmass
are almost entirely dominated by black squares (three tense values), except for the
128.â•‡ The pilot sample consists of 211 of the 222 languages in our tense maps, 10 of which have been
replaced with close relatives.

Eastern edge. The grey symbols (two tense values) form an east-west belt across Af-
rica just under the Sahara, and also a belt stretching north-south across Eastern Asia
and the west Pacific from Far Eastern Siberia all the way down northern Australia.
The Americas form a more mixed picture, even though the black squares seem to
dominate in South America and the grey symbols in North America. As for the two
subcategories of value (ii), there is no discernible pattern to languages with past but
no future tense.
Map 8.1â•‡ Pilot survey of tense values. White triangles: no tense (24 languages); grey
dots: past/nonpast (15 languages); grey diamonds: future/nonfuture (58 languages);
black squares: past/present/future (113 languages). For a full legend, see http://dx.doi.
org/10.1075/z.176.additional.
Most languages that lack a specific tense category tend to have a more or less rich
aspect system. However, one language in the survey, Maybrat, lacks both tense and
aspect categories (Dol 1999).
In Examples (123) and (124) the tenses are marked synthetically with suffixes. Lan-
guages may also mark tense analytically with auxiliaries or particles, or non-linearly
with stem or tone changes. English is an example of a language that marks future tense
analytically, as in I will cook for you tonight, where the auxiliary will is the future tense
marker. Rapanui marks past tense analytically with the particle i ‘past’.
		 Rapanui (Austronesian (Oceanic): Easter Island, Chile)
	 (126)	 a	 Papi	 i	 ma’u	 i	 te	 rama
		 p.sg	 Papi	 past	 take	 rlt	 spe	 torch
		 ‘Papi took the torch.’  (Du Feu 1996:â•›156)
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 199
An example of tense marked through lexical suppletion (stem change) can be found
in English: compare go (present tense) versus went (past tense). Kuche (Niger-Congo
(Platoid): Nigeria) is another example of a language where tense is marked through
suppletion: compare āàkɛ̄n ‘s/he will run’ (future tense) with áākɛ̄n ‘she ran’ (past
tense), where the difference lies only in tone and stress (Wilson 1996:â•›75).
Languages may also mix strategies; English is an example of such a language,
where the past is either synthetically marked (as in I cook-ed for you yesterday) or
marked through lexical suppletion (go versus went), but where the future tense is
marked analytically. It seems more common to have inflectional marking for the past
tense than for the future tense: almost exactly half of the languages in our sample, 110
of 222 (49.5%) have inflectional marking for the future tense (Dahl & Velupillai 2011b),
while considerably more than half of the languages in Dahl (1985) and Bybee et al.
(1994) have inflectional marking for the past tense.
8.2.1	 	 Remoteness
Languages may have more fine-grained grammatical distinctions for time than sim-
ply before/simultaneous to/after Now in that they grammatically distinguish between
degrees of remoteness from the Now. That is, languages may code an event as having
taken place in the near past or remote past, and likewise languages may code for an
event going to take place in the immediate or remote future. Of our 222 languages
mapped for past tense, 38 (17.1%) have two or three remoteness distinctions, while
only two languages (0.9%), Yagua (Peba-Yaguan (Peba-Yaguan): Peru) and Chácobo
(Panoan (Panoan): Bolivia), have four or more remoteness distinctions. The biggest
group, with 94 (42.3%) languages, have past tense but lack remoteness distinctions,
and the second biggest group, with 88 (39.6%) languages, lack a past tense altogeth-
er. A very common cut-off point among languages with remoteness in the past is to
distinguish between ‘today’ (hodiernal past) or ‘not-today’ (hesternal past). An ex-
ample of a language with a hodiernal/hesternal system is Supyire, which has three dis-
tinct past tense markers: nî ‘recent past’, ná ‘remote past’ and màha ‘formal past’
(CarlsonÂ�1994:â•›329).
		 Supyire (Niger-Congo (Gur): Mali)
	 (127)	 a.	 mìì	 nî	 mu	 pyi	 dì	 yɛ́?
			 1sg	 rec.past	 2sg	 tell	 how	 q
			 ‘What did I tell you (earlier today)?’
		 b.	 jò	 u	 ná	 sá	 lí	 lwó	 yɛ?
			 who	 3sg	 rem.past	 go	 it	 take	 q
			 ‘Who went and took it?’  (Carlson 1994:â•›332–3)
200	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
The use of the marker nî in (127a) means that the event referred to took place before
the moment of speech but sometime during the same day. In other words, it would
be ungrammatical to combine nî with some temporal adverb like yesterday. The
marker ná in (127b) means that the event referred to took place before the current
day, which means that it would be ungrammatical to combine it with an adverb like
‘today’. The formal past marker màha is used to introduce formal narratives, such as
folktales and myths.
Languages may code for remoteness in the future too. An example of a language
with a bipartite remoteness distinction in the future which is roughly equivalent to a
hodiernal/hesternal system is Cupeño, where the immediate future contrasts with the
ordinary future.
		 Cupeño (Uto-Aztecan (Takic): USA)
	 (128)	 a.	 amay=ne	 aya	 imi=yaxi-qat	 mix-an-pi
			 today=1sg.erg	 now	 2pl.obj=say-imm.fut	 do-an129-subirr
			 ‘Now today I’m going to tell you what to do.’
		 b.	 tukumay=ne=pe	 eme-yka	 ngiiy
			 tomorrow=1sg=irr	 2pl-behind	 go.away.fut
			 ‘Tomorrow I will go after you.’  (Hill 2005:â•›128, 130)
The immediate future in (128a) readily combines with such adverbials as ‘now’, ‘today’
and ‘soon’, while the ordinary future in (128b) tends to combine with such adverbials
as ‘after a while’ and ‘tomorrow’, indicating that it has a higher degree of remoteness.
An example of a language with a very complex remoteness system is Yagua, with seven
different tenses: irrealis/future, present, proximate-1 (proximate future or immediate
past), proximate-2 (proximate future or one day ago past), past-1 (several weeks ago
past), past-2 (several months ago past) and past-3 (distant or legendary past) (Payne
1985a:â•›240).130 The five remoteness distinctions are shown in Table 8.2.
Some Bantu languages also have highly complex remoteness systems, such as the
Kongo (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): DR Congo) dialects Yombe, Western Gogo and Mi-
tuku with five remoteness distinctions for the past. To have multiple remoteness in the
future is less common. For an in-depth discussion on the tense and aspect systems of
Bantu languages, see Nurse (2008).
129.â•‡ â•‚an denotes a root augmenting suffix to the verb.
130.â•‡ Payne (1985a) lists an eighth tense ‘narrative present’ which essentially is a relative tense where
the base form, the present, is used once the time reference has been established at the beginning of
the narrative. See further below.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 201
8.2.2	 	 Absolute tense
The standard way of defining absolute tense is that it places the event or event time
(E) either before, after, or simultaneous to the speech point (S), i.e. the present mo-
ment. We can think of this as E relative S where the event E is placed somewhere on a
timeline relative to the speech point S. An absolute past, then, would be a grammati-
cal way of expressing that the event is placed before the speech point on a timeline, E
before S, as in Figure 8.2131.
E S

202	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Reading from left to right, the event occurs before the speech point on the timeline.
An example of an absolute past would be I took out the garbage, where the event (tak-
ing out the garbage) took place before the time of my utterance. An absolute present
places the event at the same time as the speech moment, E simul S, where ‘simul’
stands for ‘simultaneous to’, as shown in Figure 8.3.
E = S
Figure 8.3â•‡ Absolute present: the event takes place simultaneously to the speech point.
In Figure 8.3 the event takes place at the same time as the moment of utterance, as
indicated by the ‘=’ between E and S. Some languages, English among them, use the
present tense to denote generic truths rather than to place an event in the immediate
Now, for which other constructions are used. In English the progressive (a type of
aspect, see below) is used to place an event in the Now. Compare He eats fish (marked
for present tense) versus He is eating fish (marked for the present progressive), where
the former indicates a general capacity or activity (the person in question can eat fish,
i.e. does not shy away from that type of food for any reason) while the latter unambig-
uously indicates that the act of eating is taking place at the moment of the utterance
(the person is at this moment engaged in the activity of eating fish). Many languages,
however, only use the regular present tense (without any additional aspect marking)
to express the absolute present. An example is Swedish; consider the dialogue below
and how it has to be translated into English:
		 Swedish (Indo-European (Germanic): Sweden)
	 (129)	 Q:	 vad	 gör	 du?
			 what	 do.pres	 2sg
			 ‘What are you doing?’
		 A:	 Jag	 ritar	 en	 blomma.
			 1sg	 draw.pres	 art	 flower
			 ‘I am drawing a flower.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In (129) the question has the verb göra ‘do’ in the present tense because the speaker
wants to know what the listener is doing at the time of utterance, S. Likewise the verb
rita ‘draw’ in the answer is in the present tense, indicating that the act E is taking
place at the time of the utterance. Notice that here the English translations require the
progressive aspect (doing and drawing); it would have been incorrect to translate the
question in (129) as *What do you? or the answer as *I draw a flower.
The absolute future places the event after the speech point, E after S or S before E,
both of which are simply alternative ways of expressing the same equation.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 203
S E
Figure 8.4â•‡ Absolute future: the event takes place after the speech point.
An example of an absolute future would be I will draw a flower for you tomorrow,
where the event (drawing a flower) will take place after the moment of speech.
8.2.3	 	 Relative tense
A relative tense system also places the event on a timeline, but relates it to a given ref-
erence point (R) instead of to the speech point. The event may thus occur before, si-
multaneously to or after the reference point. The relative past, anterior132 tense, places
the event before the reference point, E before R.
E R
Figure 8.5â•‡ Relative past, or anterior: the event is placed before the reference point.
An example of relative past (anterior tense) can be found in Ghanaian Pidgin Eng-
lish, where the location in time of the event is either explicitly established or implied
through an already known context.
		 Ghanaian Pidgin English (Pidgin (English-lexified): Ghana)
	 (130)	 ɛnitin	 hapin	 fɔ	 kɔŋkɔmba	 pipu,	 dè	 dè	 kam	 kɔmplen
		 anything	 happen	 for	 Kokomba	 people	 3pb	 npu	 come	 complain
		 tu	 dagɔmba	 ʧif…	 bat	 nau	 dè	 wan	 tu	 gɛt	 dɛ̀a
		 to	 Dagomba	 chief	 but	 now	 3pb	 int	 to	 get	 3pp
		 on	 indipɛndɛns
		 own	 independence
		 ‘(Formerly) the Kokombas referred anything that happened to the Dagomba chief.
But now they want to get their independence.’  (Huber 1999:â•›219)
In Example (130) the speaker is first referring to how the state of affairs was before
tensions arose between the two ethnic groups (Kokomba and Dagomba), an event in
the past that is known to both speaker and hearer; the unmarked verb hapin ‘happen’
thus refers to an event in the past and is located before the subsequently expressed
reference point bat nau ‘but now’ on the timeline (which refers to the present state
of affairs).
132.â•‡ Notice that Bybee et al. (1994) use the term ‘anterior’ to denote what is otherwise called ‘perfect’.
204	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
It is important to bear in mind that the reference point does not necessarily
have to be in the speech moment. In fact, in pure relative tenses, the speech moment
is quite irrelevant. We could thus have instances of a relative past occurring prior
to the moment of speech, but also posterior to the moment of speech. Compare
Figures 8.6 and 8.7:
E R S
Figure 8.6â•‡ The relative past (anterior; E before R) takes place before the speech point.
S E R
Figure 8.7â•‡ The relative past (anterior; E before R) takes place after the speech point.
An example of E before R preceding the moment of speech (Figure 8.6) is, for in-
stance, I notice that you ate all the chocolate before leaving for school. Here the refer-
ence point R is the act of leaving for school, while E, which comes before R on the
timeline, is the act of having eaten all the chocolate. However, both of these acts oc-
curred before the speech point S (I notice). An example of E before R coming after the
moment of speech (Figure 8.7) would be something like I am telling you that I will
have left when you come home. Here again the E (my leaving) takes places before R
(you coming home), but the whole E before R will only take place after the moment of
speech (which is at the time I am telling you about it).
The relative present functions in the same way, namely placing the event simulta-
neously to the given reference point, E simul R.
E = R
Figure 8.8â•‡ Relative present: the event takes place simultaneously to the reference point.
In Figure 8.8 the event takes place at the same time as the reference point. I stress
again that the reference point does not have to be equal to the speech point. For in-
stance, E simul R could take place before S. English does not have a grammatical way
of marking the relative present, but an example of the principle might be something
like He scratched his head while muttering to himself, where the act of scratching
the head and muttering to himself take place simultaneously, as expressed by the
adverbial while. Both of these acts, however, take place before the speech point, as
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 205
Â�
indicated by the past tense scratched.133 And while English does not have a grammati-
cal way of marking it, E simul R may also be placed after the speech point. An exam-
ple would be something like, I am telling him the joke and know he will be scratching
his head while muttering to himself, where E simul R (scratching the head at the same
time as muttering to himself) will take place after the speech point which is the act
of telling the joke.
The relative future, posterior tense, locates the event after the given reference
point, E after R or R before E.
R E
Figure 8.9â•‡ The relative future (posterior): the event is placed after the reference point.
English does not have any overt grammatical marking for posterior tense, but a sen-
tence like He will do it if you ask him lacks a speech point and so can be said to
express relative future where the event (the act of doing something) comes after the
reference point (the act of asking). The crucial thing is that the speech point is ir-
relevant; what is indicated with relative futures is only that E will take place after R.
Hausa is an example of a language with a posterior tense, i.e. a relative future tense
(Wolff 1993:â•›431).
8.3	 The perfect
The perfect is a somewhat more complex category than those described above and has
variously been labelled a tense and an aspect category. Recall that the tense categories
above all have the basic principle of locating an event before, simultaneously to, or
after a given location on the timeline (either the speech point or a reference point).
A very essential and crucial property of the perfect, however, is that while it places an
event prior to a given location on the timeline, the event is still relevant at that loca-
tion. In other words, the perfect spans two separate locations on the timeline, since,
even though the event itself took place before the speech or reference point, it is still
valid at S or R, that is, it is still having an effect on or is somehow relevant to the given
reference point. Consider Figure 8.10:
133.â•‡ The historic present could also be argued to be a relative tense: something like Marie Antoinette
kneels on the guillotine and the crowd cheers would be E=R but the whole episode is clearly located
before the moment of speech.
206	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
E S/R
Figure 8.10â•‡ Perfect tense: the event takes place before the speech/reference point, but is
still relevant at that point on the timeline.
In Figure 8.10 the event is located before the speech/reference point on the timeline,
but the dotted arrow indicates that E is still relevant at the speech/reference point.
Consider Pooh’s reply to Owl’s question of how he is doing:
	 (131)	 “Terrible and Sad,” said Pooh, “because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine,
		 has lost his tail. […]” (Milne 1974:â•›46)
In Example (131) the perfect has lost indicates that the event took place before the time
of Pooh’s recounting it – the disappearance of the tail happened at some point in the
past in relation to the Now on Pooh’s timeline – but it is still relevant when Pooh men-
tions it; the tail is still lost.
The entire equation of an event that occurs before a given point but that is still
relevant at that point can be placed before or after the speech point on a timeline to
form the past perfect (pluperfect) or the future perfect. These can in effect be said to
span over three separate locations on the timeline: the E, which takes place before R
(but is still relevant at the point of R), all of which is placed in relation to S.134 In the
case of the pluperfect, the perfect is placed prior to the speech point, as in Figure 8.11:
E R S
Figure 8.11â•‡ Pluperfect tense: the event takes place before the reference point and is still
relevant at that point on the timeline, all of which is located before the speech point.
An example of the constellation shown in Figure 8.11 would be something like I had
already sealed the envelope when I saw the check lying on the table so now I have to open
it again. Here the event at the speech point is in the Now, thus in the present tense
(have), while the event situated prior to the Now, namely R, is in the past (saw). The
event that stands in relation to R and is also relevant at R, namely E, is in the pluper-
fect (had sealed), since the envelope was still sealed at the time I saw the check.
The future perfect functions in the same way, except that the speech point moves
to before E, as in Figure 8.12.
134.â•‡ It could thus be argued that pluperfect and future perfect are absolute tenses, since they are by
necessity related to the speech point.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 207
S E R
Figure 8.12â•‡ Future perfect tense: the event takes place before the reference point and is
still relevant at that point on the timeline, all of which is located after the speech point.
An example of future perfect would be something like He says that he will have fin-
ished before we arrive. Here says is in the present tense indicating the speech point.
At a later stage on the timeline, after the speech point, the E (he will finish) will be
something of the past at the time of R (we arrive) but will still be relevant at R (he will
still be finished).
The above discussed use of the perfect may also be termed resultative. If a perfect
is used to describe an event that took place repeatedly or over a span of time, it may
be labelled as experiential (Dahl & Velupillai 2011d). An example would be something
like It has been known to happen before, where the speaker indicates that whatever
happened now is not unique, because it has happened repeatedly in the past, and the
experience of those occasions still holds. In our survey we noted languages as having
the perfect tense if the language included both the resultative and experiential use.
This means that those languages where the construction is only used as a resultative or
only as an experiential were listed as not having the perfect. Slightly more than half of
the languages in our sample, 114 of 222 (51.4%) lack the perfect. While these languages
are spread over the world, they cluster somewhat in Australia as well as North and
South America.
An interesting feature of the perfect is where it derives from. While those of us who
are used to mainly Western European languages might assume that the default is to de-
rive the perfect from the possessive construction, as it is in English (have verb), this in
fact a very rare phenomenon found in only seven of the 118 languages that have perfect
(5.9% of the languages with perfect or 3.2% of the languages in the entire sample). It is,
in fact, in our sample found only in Indo-European languages located in Europe on the
map: English, German, Icelandic, Swedish, French, Spanish and Modern Greek. Three
times as many languages, 21 (17.8% of the languages that have perfect or 9.5% of the
whole sample), derive their perfects from expressions meaning ‘finish’ or ‘already’. The
remaining 80 languages with perfects have various other sources for the construction.
For more on the origins of grammatical markers (grammaticalization), see 13.1.
Another interesting feature of the perfect is that it may develop into a simple past
tense (E before S) or a perfective aspect (see below); this has happened or is currently
happening in central Western Europe, in an area stretching from Germany down to
Corsica and from the Atlantic coast of France and Belgium to the eastern border of
Germany and Austria (Dahl & Velupillai 2011d).
208	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
8.4	 Aspect
While tense is the linguistic tool for placing an event on a timeline, aspect can be said
to be, very simplified, the tool for defining the perspective taken on an event. In other
words, aspect can be thought of as the device used to grammatically express differ-
ent views of events in relation to their respective start and end points. For thorough
discussions on aspect, see, for example, Comrie (1976) and Dahl (1985), which are
classics by now. For a more theoretical – but very elegant – framework for aspect, see
Smith (1997) and Johanson (2000).
It is important not to confuse tense with aspect, even if they are interrelated in
many ways. Irrespective of what perspective we take on an event it can be placed on a
timeline relative to a given reference point: He coughed (once) versus He was coughing
(repeatedly or over a period of time) are two different perspectives taken on the same
event, both of which are located at a particular point on the timeline (E before S/R).
The location on the timeline can change, however, even if the respective perspectives
do not: the sentences He will cough (once) versus He will be coughing (repeatedly or
over a period of time) keep the perspectives intact, but move the event to a different
location on the timeline (E after S/R).
8.4.1	 	 Aspect versus Aktionsart
While aspect deals with the perspective taken on an event, Aktionsart (also called ac-
tionality, lexical aspect or sometimes derivational aspect) specifies the inner struc-
ture of the event (see, for example, Johanson 2000 for a very thorough discussion on
the difference between aspect and Aktionsart or actionality). Aspect is a grammatical
category while Aktionsart is a lexical, semantic, specification. Consider the follow-
ing verbs: seethe, dwell, cough, freeze, sing, build. They can all be placed at different
locations on the timeline relative to a reference point: seethed/will seethe, dwelled/will
dwell, coughed/will cough, froze/will freeze, sang/will sing, built/will build. Yet they are
inherently different in many ways. This is because they differ in their Aktionsart or
actionality. There is something inherently dynamic about seethe which is not there
in a verb like dwell. There is something inherently punctual about cough which is not
there in freeze. And there is an inherent end point in build which is not there in sing.
Verbs may be dynamic or stative (non-dynamic), which means that their inher-
ent semantics encode whether their inner structure involve any form of change or
not. With dynamic verbs there is an inherent element of change: if something seethes
or runs or falls the event itself encodes some kind of action. With stative verbs there
is no element of change, merely a constant state: if someone knows (something) or
dwells (somewhere) or something contains (something) there is no action involved
and there is no inherent meaning of internal evolution.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 209
Verbs may also be punctual or durative, which means that their inherent seman-
tics encode whether their inner structure allow for a duration in time or not. With
punctual verbs there is no real internal structure to the event: to cough or to sneeze or
to flash are all events that last only an instant and have no particular inner structure
consisting of different phases of that event. Durative verbs, on the other hand, do
contain this inner structure that is made up of a string of phases: if something freezes
or burns or blows, there is an element of time inherent in the verb. The various phases
that are inherent in the verb freeze, from the stage where the element is completely
unfrozen, to the stage where it is completely frozen, involve a gradual change which
in itself implies a certain amount of duration. Notice that dynamicity and punctuality
are not necessarily mutually exclusive: an example of a dynamic punctual verb would
be cough, while seethe is a dynamic durative verb. Stative verbs tend to be durative.
Finally, verbs may be telic or atelic, which means that their inherent semantics
imply an inherent end point (telic) or no inherent end point (atelic). Telic verbs inher-
ently contain an element of the action or event coming to an end: to build, to make, to
bake are all verbs that imply that even if the action has a certain amount of duration,
eventually it will end, since eventually we will have finished building the house or fin-
ished making the pot or finished baking the cake, unless we break off in the middle.
If we break off in the middle, however, we cannot say that we have built or made or
baked something. Atelic verbs do not contain this inherent end point: even if such
verbs as sing or play or dance involve a certain duration in time, there is no implicit
finishing point. We may stop singing or dancing or playing, but that doesn’t leave any
unfinished business as it would if we broke off in the middle of building or baking or
making something.
8.4.2		 Perfective versus imperfective
As mentioned above, the traditional definition of aspect is that it deals with the inter-
nal structure of an event. But as we have seen, this is rather a definition of Aktionsart
or actionality. Aspect, on the other hand, is a grammatical category denoting the per-
spective taken on an event. That is, it deals with “morphological devices expressing
different views of linguistically represented events, envisaging them in various ways
relative to their limits, and signalling how they come into view at aspectual view-
points” (Johanson 2001:â•›7). This section will give a very simplified and brief defini-
tion of the two major aspect categories, perfective and imperfective, as well as some
common subcategories. In essence, this is a simplified version of Johanson’s (2000)
framework.
An event may have a beginning, a course and an end. The event in question may
be viewed from within, during its course, or from outside its course, as a demarcated
or bounded whole. The basic notion of perfective aspect is that the perspective is on
210	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the whole, bounded or ‘captured’ event, while the basic notion of the imperfective
aspect is that the perspective is within the event, during its course. Figure 8.13 is an
attempt to illustrate the basic difference between the two:
PerFectiVe
Event Event
ImPerFectiVe
Figure 8.13â•‡ The basic difference between perfective and imperfective aspect is that
with perfective aspect the perspective (illustrated with the eye symbol) is on the event
as a bounded whole, while with imperfective aspect the perspective is within the event,
during its course.
It is very important here to not confuse the perfect tense with the perfective aspect
despite the similarity of the two terms. The former locates an event on the timeline,
while the latter specifies how the event is viewed (namely as a bounded whole). View-
ing an event as a bounded whole does not necessarily tell us much about the internal
structure of that event. It may be a punctual event with no internal structure at all,
or it may be a durative dynamic event with an internal structure. The crucial thing
is that the event is viewed in its totality, as a bounded unit. Viewing an event from
within also tells us rather little about the internal structure of that event. Even if it is
an event of a very limited durativity, it can, theoretically, be viewed from within. Most
commonly, however, punctual events combined with an imperfective aspect tend to
denote repetitions of the event.
An example of a language with a bipartite perfective/imperfective system is Ren-
dille, where the ending indicates aspect:
Rendille (Afro-Asiatic (Eastern Cushitic): Kenya)
	 (132)	 a.	 khadaabbe	 chiirte
			 letter.pl	 write.pfv
			 ‘He wrote letters.’
		 b.	 khadaabbe	 chiirta
			 letter.pl	 write.ipfv
			 ‘He writes/is writing/wrote/was writing/will write letters.’
 (Dahl & Velupillai 2011a)
In (132a) the ending â•‚e signals perfective aspect and specifies that the event is a bound-
ed whole. In (132b) the ending â•‚a signals imperfective aspect and indicates that event
is viewed from within, during its course. There is neither a beginning point nor an end
point indicated in (132b). In fact, there is no specification whatsoever, except that the
event is (or was or will be) taking place.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 211
The perfective aspect readily combines with the past tense, since for an event to
be viewed in its totality it typically has to have come to an end. Notice, however, that
strictly speaking that is aspect in combination with tense, in the sense that the event
and the perspective taken on it are placed prior to a given reference point on the time-
line. We may thus also have the logical combination of an event in the imperfective
aspect placed prior to a given reference point on the timeline. An example of the con-
trasts perfective versus imperfective in combination with the past tense can be found
in literary French, where an event located E before S on the timeline may be either in
the passé simple (past definite) or in the imparfait (imperfect tense or past indefinite):
		 French (Indo-European (Romance): France)
	 (133)	 a.	 Marie	 mangea	 lentement
			 PN	 eat.pastd	 slowly
			 ‘Marie ate slowly.’
		 b.	 Marie	 mangeait	 lentement
			 PN	 eat.pasti	 slowly
			 ‘Marie ate slowly.’  (source: personal knowledge)
The difference between the sentences in (133a and b) is one of aspect: the events are
both located in the past but in (133a) the event is a bounded whole and urges the nar-
rative forward – we want to know what happened next – whereas in (133b) the event is
not bounded and serves as a background for other things that happened while Marie
was eating. This is a typical difference between perfective and imperfective aspects:
the perfective tends to drive a narrative forward, viewing each event in its totality,
while the imperfective tends to serve as a background against which other events take
place. It is not possible to completely capture in English the aspectual difference be-
tween the two sentences in (133); the nearest translational equivalents would be some-
thing like ‘Marie ate slowly’ (then something else happened) for (133a) and ‘Marie was
eating slowly’ (while something else occurred) for (133b).
While it is less common to combine the perfective/imperfective opposition with
the future tense than it is to combine it with the past tense, there are languages with
this opposition. Modern Greek, for example, has two different forms for the future,
the future aorist (future tense with perfective aspect) and the ‘future paratatikos’ or
continuous future (future tense with imperfective aspect). The difference between
grapso (write.1sg.fut:aor) ‘I will write’ and grapho (write.1sg.fut:par) ‘I will write’ is
that the former event is viewed as a bounded whole placed in the future on a timeline,
while the latter, also placed in the future on a timeline, is viewed from within. The
formed denotes that there will be an end to the event after which the next event will
take place, while the latter has no such connotation and merely indicates that the writ-
ing event will be taking place in the future, and might be better translated as ‘I will be
writing (when X, Y or Z will take place)’.
212	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
It is quite common in the world to have grammatical marking of perfective versus
imperfective aspect. In our sample of 222 languages 101 (45.5%) have grammatical
marking of aspect while 121 (54.5%) do not (Dahl & Velupillai 2011a). French is an ex-
ample of the former and English an example of the latter. Geographically the picture
is rather mixed, but Northern Europe and South-East Asia are areas where languages
consistently lack grammatical aspect.
The progressive aspect can be thought of as a subcategory of the imperfective. It
specifically denotes that the event is ongoing. This is the only inflectionally marked
aspect category that English has, the â•‚ing form. This may combine with tense to form
either the past, present or future progressive by combining with a tense inflected form
of be (as in I was writing, I am writing, I will be writing). The Aktionsart or actionality
of the verb is largely irrelevant, although progressive aspect with a stative verb tends
to get a special reading of confinedness. So while someone can be running (progres-
sive aspect, dynamic verb), be blowing (progressive aspect, durative verb), be build-
ing (progressive aspect, telic verb) and be singing (progressive aspect, atelic verb), to
say that someone is knowing/containing something would only be possible in highly
specific contexts. The progressive aspect with a punctual Aktionsart tends to give an
iterative meaning in English: The lamp is flashing implies that the punctual act of the
flash is repeated several times.
The habitual denotes that an event takes place regularly or is true for an extended
period. As such it can also be thought of as a subcategory of the imperfective. The
habitual should not be confused with iterativity, which specifically denotes repetition
on a single occasion. The habitual merely states that an event is true over an extended
period of time. English has a tense restricted habitual for the past only: the construc-
tion used to verb, which indicates that the event was true for an extended period of
time to the degree that it becomes characteristic of this period, as in I used to live in
Berlin or I used to play the piano every afternoon or I used to cough in the nights when I
was a child. An example of a language where the habitual does not have tense restric-
tions is Nalik.
		 Nalik (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
	 (134)	 gu	 runa	 va-nam-doxo	 yang	 ni
		 2npl	 hab	 cau-stomach-good	 foc	 1sg
		 ‘You (always) make me so happy.’  (Volker 1994:â•›80)
In (134) there is no tense specified but simply the fact that the event happens often
over a long period of time.135
135.â•‡ This would be termed habitual-generic (habg) in Dahl (1985), where a discussion on the differ-
ence between habitual and generic is given.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 213
The iterative denotes repetition (iteration) of an event on a single occasion, in-
dicating that the event took place as a series of bounded wholes. As such it might
conceptually be considered a subcategory of perfective aspect, in the sense that (i) it
refers to a series of repeated bounded events and (ii) this series of repeated bounded
events occur on one single occasion. In other words, it is a bounded event consisting
of several individually bounded events. However, it tends to be expressed through
imperfective means. English does not have a specific form for iterative aspect, and
instead expresses it with such expressions as to verb and verb, or to verb again and
again as in He blew and blew or He dialled the number again and again (but they never
answered). The iterative is often marked through reduplication, as in Kayardild, where
verbal reduplication indicates multiple repetition of an event:
		 Kayardild (Australian (Tangkic): Australia)
	 (135)	 dara~dara-tha	 raa-ja	 warirr
		 break-red-act	 spear-act	 nothing
		 ‘(They) speared (him) but (their spears) broke and broke again, nothing (hap-
pened).’ (lit. ‘Speared, broke and broke, nothing.’)
		 waldarra	 jabi~jabi-j	 kurumbu	 bula-a-nangku
		 moon.nom	 shudder-red-act	 barbed.spear.nom	 pull-mod-negpot
		 ‘Moon shuddered and shuddered but the spear could not be pulled out.’
 (Evans 1995:â•›290)
In (135) the reduplicated verbs daraâ•‚ ‘break’ and jabiâ•‚ ‘shudder’ denote that the event is
repeated on a single occasion. The repeated breakings and shudderings are not spread
out over an extended period of time, but happen several times on one occasion.
The completive denotes the completion of an event and as such could be argued
to be a kind of subcategory of the perfective aspect. English does not have a specific
completive marker, and instead has to use such expressions as to finish verb, as in He
finished analysing his data. Completive aspect may often be translated into the English
perfect (X has happened). Engenni is an example of a language with completive, as is
Hawai‘i Creole English.
		 Engenni (Niger-Congo (Edoid): Nigeria)
	 (136)	 á	 gbè	 ạ̀dhè	 bhi	 nì	 o
		 one	 let.go.home	 day	 be.black	 compl	 in.fact
		 ‘Let’s go home! It has got dark, you know.’  (Thomas 1978:â•›73)
		 Hawai‘i Creole English (Creole: Hawai‘i, USA)
	 (137)	 da	 wahinɛ…	 ða	 wan	 dæd	 ʤɛs	 paʊ	 hanaʊ
		 def	 woman	 def	 indef	 rel	 just	 compl	 give.birth
		 ‘The woman (…) the one that just gave birth.’ (lit. ‘…the one that just finished
give.birth.’)  (Velupillai 2003:â•›98)
214	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
The completive markers in the examples above denote that the event has reached
completion (nì in Engenni and pau in Hawai‘i Creole English). Notice that this is not
possible to capture exactly in English; the fact that Example (136) translates into an
English perfect and Example (137) into an English past is only because those are the
closest equivalent meanings that allow for a fluent English sentence and not because
these markers denote the perfect or past tenses.
8.5	 Mood and modality
Mode is, very simplified, the category that codes a speaker’s attitude toward a situ-
ation or statement. This includes the speaker’s belief in the reality of the event, the
likelihood that the event will occur, or the quality of information that the speaker
has about the event. Once again, it is important to keep in mind that we are dealing
with grammatical categories. Many languages will have ways of expressing attitudes
and beliefs towards an event, but they may or may not have grammatical categories
specifically used to code these attitudes. The terms ‘mood’ and ‘modality’ are often
used interchangeably. When they are distinguished, mood tends to denote a high-
er level distinction for the whole clause of realis (asserting that a proposition holds
true) versus irrealis (making no assertion with respect to the truth of the proposition)
while modality denotes semantic labels of attitudes towards events. The term ‘mode’
is sometimes used to cover both mood and modality. For a very accessible and thor-
ough discussion on mood and modality, see Palmer (2001), which this section relies
heavily on.
8.5.1	 	 Realis and irrealis
Realis is typically used when the speaker is very sure that the event has happened or
that the state of affairs holds true. Irrealis, on the other hand, carries no such asser-
tions. It is basically a distinction between “actual and non-actual events” (Chung &
Timberlake 1985:â•›241), or between asserted and non-asserted propositions. A sentence
like I rang the doorbell would be an example of something in the realis; I am asserting
as a true and indisputable fact in the real world that I rang the doorbell (or at the very
least, I am utterly convinced about the veracity of that fact). A sentence like If I ring
the doorbell, however, would be an example of irrealis. The event has not happened
and might never happen in the real world, hence an assertion of absolute certainty
about the fact of the event would be inappropriate. Notice here that irrealis does not
necessarily state that the event will not take place or is not true, it simply “makes
no claims with respect to the actuality of the event or situation described” (Payne
1997:â•›244). Consider the following examples from Tugun:
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 215
		 Tugun (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia)
	 (138)	 a.	 ra-tunu	 ika
			 3pl.r-cook	 fish
			 ‘They cooked fish.’
		 b.	 lalaik	 Ø-gisan	 hala?	 lalaik	 Ø-gisan	 raha
			 man	 3sg.r-make	 what	 man	 3sg.r-make	 house
			 ‘What are you doing? I’m working on my house.’
		 c.	 au	 mu-la	 naha
			 1sg	1sg.irr-go	 first
			 ‘I’ll go now.’
		 d.	 hira	 marr-ala	 la	 hira
			 3pl	 3pl.irr-take	 to	 3pl
			 ‘They wanted to take (them) for themselves.’
		 e.	 mu-osi	 oni	 hala	 le	 mu-seli
			 1sg.irr-do	 like	 what	 so	 1sg.irr-pry.up
			 ‘What should I do in order to pry (it) up?’
		 f.	 om-oci	 ni	 heri	 mu-ta-mate
			 2sg.irr-use	 3sg	 dem	 1sg.irr-neg-die
			 ‘If you use this, I won’t die.’  (Hinton 1991:â•›99)
The unifying element of Examples (138a and b) is that it is an undisputable fact that
they happened or are happening, indicated by the portmanteau markers Ø (3sg.
realisÂ�
) and raâ•‚ (3pl.realis) while the unifying element in Examples (138c–f) is that an
assertion of undisputable reality of the events or situations is not possible, and thus
the verbs have to be coded in the irrealis mode, indicated by the portmanteau markers
muâ•‚ (1sg.irrealis), marrâ•‚ (3pl.irrealis) and omâ•‚ (2sg.irrealis). Notice, however, that
this does not mean that the speaker is claiming that the events or situations will never
happen, but simply that it is not possible to absolutely assert that they have taken place
(or are taking place) in the real world. In Examples (138c and f), for instance, it seems
safe to assume that the speaker is quite convinced that the respective events will take
place. Likewise in Example (138e) it is reasonable to assume that the speaker is con-
vinced that the event of prying open will take place once the relevant advice of how to
do it has been given. Example (138d) is a counterfactual: the taking (of something for
themselves) never took place in the real world.
The realis/irrealis opposition is essentially the same as the indicative/subjunctive
opposition found in many Indo-European languages, such as in the Spanish example
below.
		 Spanish (Indo-European (Romance): Spain)
	 (139)	 si	 no	 hubiera	 sido	 por	 Anita,	mi	 reloj	 sería	 perdido
		 if	 neg	 have.subj	 been	 for	 PN	 my	 watch	 be.subj	 lost
		 ‘If it had not been for Anita, my watch would be lost.’  (Payne 1997:â•›245)
216	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
For a discussion on the difference in function between the irrealis and subjunctive
modes, see Palmer (2001).
Realis mood interacts readily with such tenses as the past, present and nonfuture,
i.e. tenses that place the events on such a location on the timeline that an assertion
about their validity is possible. If something has already taken place, or is right now
taking place, it is possible to assert that the proposition holds true, which makes the
realis mood appropriate to use. Irrealis mood, on the other hand, tends to interact
readily with such tenses as the future and nonpast, i.e. tenses that place the events on
such a location on the timeline that an assertion about their validity is not possible.
I stress again that this does not necessarily mean that the events are never going to
happen, merely that it is not possible to make any claims about their validity. If some-
thing is predicted to happen in the future, the speaker may be utterly convinced that
it will happen, but will still not be able to assert that it has happened. Consider the
examples from Anjam below:
		 Anjam (Trans-New Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (140)	 a.	 e	 tabir	 yans-eqn-a-m	 Rut	 alaŋ-oqn-e-j
			 1sg	dishes	 wash-sim.r-rem.past-1sg.r.ds	 PN	 play-contr-rem.past-3sg
			 ‘While I washed the dishes Ruth played.’
		 b.	 e	 ino	 bem	 qoit-et-i-t	 ni	 uy-e
			 1sg	your	 bread	 bake-ben-fut-1sg.ir.ds	 2sg	eat-imp
			 ‘When I bake your bread, you eat.’  (Roberts 1990:â•›382)
In Example (140a) the simultaneous realis marker â•‚eqnâ•‚ is used with the remote past
marker â•‚aâ•‚ and the suffix â•‚m, the first person singular, realis, different subject marker;
because the event has already taken place, it is quite possible to assert its veracity. In
(140b) the future marker â•‚iâ•‚ is used with the suffix â•‚t, the first person singular, irrealis,
different subject marker; because the event hasn’t taken place yet, it is not possible to
absolutely assert its factuality, even if it is highly likely to happen.
grammaticalized futility
In Mapudungun (Araucanian (Araucanian): Chile) the suffix â•‚fu denotes‘ruptured implicature’
(ri), meaning that an expected result did not occur, so the event or action was to no avail.
amu-fu-n	 tañi	 weṉüy	 mew,	 welu	 pe-la-fi-ñ
go-ri-1sg	 1sg.poss	 friend	 ppos	 but	 find-neg-dir-1sg
‘I went to my friend’s (house), but did not find him/her.’
kiñe 	 küyeṉ	 dewma	 mawüṉ-fu-i
one	 month	 already	 rain-ri-ind
‘It rained a month ago (but to no avail [the grass did not get green].’ (Zúñiga 2000:â•›45)
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 217
8.5.2	 	 Propositional modalities
Propositional modalities have to do with speakers’ attitudes towards the truth val-
ue of the information given in the proposition. There are two basic subcategories of
propositional modality, evidentials and epistemic modalities. Evidentials code the
type of evidence a speaker has for a given proposition, while epistemic modalities
code qualitative judgements about the information in a given proposition.
8.5.2.1	 Evidentials
The type of evidence had for a proposition can be either sensory (or direct), where a
speaker is indicating that the evidence had for a proposition is through evidence of
the senses (usually auditory or visual), or the evidence can be reported (or indirect),
where a speaker is not a witness to the event but has the evidence for the proposi-
tion through hearsay or similar sources. For a thorough discussion on evidentials, see
Â�
Aikhenvald (2004).
Sensory or direct evidentials are usually based on visual evidence, i.e. that the
speaker saw it with his/her own eyes. Reported or indirect evidentials can be either
inferential, in which case the speaker infers the truth of a proposition based on physi-
cal evidence, or they can be quotative (also referred to as ‘hearsay’, ‘reportatives’, or
‘second-hand evidentials’), in which case the speaker has been told about an event.
Qiang is an example of a language that has all three kinds.
		 Qiang (Sino-Tibetan (Quiangic): China)
	 (141)	 a.	 the:	 jimi	 de-se-ji-w-a
			 3sg	 fertilizer	 or-spread-csm-vis-1sg
			 ‘She spread the fertilizer (I saw her do it).’
		 b.	 panə-le	 ɦa-χə̊-k-ən
			 thing-def	 or-broken-infr-2sg
			 ‘It seems you broke the thing.’ (Inference from seeing the broken pieces
in the person’s hand.)
		 c.	 the:	 ʑdʑyta:	 ɦa-qə-i
			 3sg	 Chengdu.loc	 or-go-hs
			 ‘He went to Chengdu (I heard).’  (LaPolla 2003:â•›66, 64, 70)
In Example (141a) the suffix â•‚w indicates that the speaker saw the event take place,
while in (141b) the suffix â•‚k indicates that speaker only has indirect evidence for the
truth of the proposition, namely the physical evidence that presumably came about
as a result of the event. In (141c) the suffix â•‚i indicates that the speaker is reporting
what s/he has been told. Foe is an example of a language with a very complex eviden-
tiality system:
218	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Foe (Trans-New Guinea (Kutuban): Papua New Guinea)
	 (142)	 a.	 na	 mini	 wa-bugege
			 I	 today	 come-pres.participating.ev
			 ‘I am coming today.’ (I am participating in the action or making a statement
of a generally known fact.)
		 b.	 aiya baye	 wa-boba’ae
			 airplane	 come-vis.ev
			 ‘An airplane is coming.’ (I can see it.)
		 c.	 aiya baye	 wa-bida’ae
			 airplane	 come-nonvis.ev
			 ‘An airplane is coming.’ (I can perceive it non-visually by hearing, smell,
feeling or understanding.)
		 d.	 Kabe	 Irabo	 wa-ada’ae
			 Mr.	 PN	 come-deductive.ev
			 ‘Mr. Irabo is coming.’ (Inference based on something for which I have
evidence perceived with my senses – e.g. I can hear Mr. Irabo and can
recognize his voice.)
		 e.	 Kabu	Maduane	 minage	 wa-bubege
			 Mr.	 PN	 still	 come-previous.evidence.ev
			 ‘Mr. Maduane is still coming.’ (I have seen the evidence but cannot see
it at the moment of speech – e.g. we both left together but I was faster
than Mr. Maduane, but I know he’s still on his way and will be coming.)
 (Aikhenvald 2004:â•›62 citing Rule 1977:â•›71)
An example of a language with a very rare system indeed is Matsés, where tense and
evidentiality interact in so far as that speakers must obligatorily specify two tenses,
the first one indicating when an inferred event happened, and the second one indi-
cating when the evidence for the inference was encountered, termed ‘double tense’
by Fleck (2007).
		 Matsés (Panoan (Panoan): Brazil, Peru)
	 (143)	 a.	 mayu-n	 bëste-wa-ak-onda-şh
			 non.Matsés.Indian-erg	 hut-make-rec.past.infer-dist.past.exp-3
			 ‘Non-Matsés Indians (had) made a hut.’
		 b.	 mayu-n	 bëste-wa-nëdak-o-şh
			 non.Matsés.Indian-erg	 hut-make-dist.past.infer-rec.past.exp-3
			 ‘Non-Matsés Indians (had) made a hut.’  (Fleck 2007:â•›589–90)
The difference between (143a and b) is that the former specifies that the speaker dis-
covered the hut a long time ago (â•‚ondaâ•‚ ‘distant past experiential’), but at the time
of the discovery the hut had only recently been made (â•‚akâ•‚ ‘recent past inference’),
whereas the latter specifies that the speaker recently discovered the hut (â•‚oâ•‚ ‘recent
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 219
past experiential’) which at the time of the discovery was old, i.e. had been made a
long time ago (â•‚nëdakâ•‚ ‘distant past inference’). There are three remoteness distinc-
tions in Matsés – recent past (immediate past to about one month ago), distant past
(about one month ago to about 50 years ago) and remote past (more than 50 years
ago) – and three kinds of evidentials (experiential, inference and conjecture). There
are thus nine logical combinations for the markers, although there are two ‘remote
past inferential’ markers but no ‘remote past conjecture’ marker (Fleck 2007).
In de Haan’s (2011) sample it is more common for languages to have evidentials
than not. Of his 418 languages, 237 (56.7%) have evidentials while 181 (43.3%) lack
them. English belongs to the latter group. Of the languages that have them, it is far
more common to only have indirect evidentials (found in 166 or 70% of the languages
with evidentials) than to have both direct and indirect evidentials (found in 71 or 30%
of the languages with evidentials). While evidentials are spread over the world, they
are extremely abundant in North and South America and quite rare in Africa.
8.5.2.2	 Epistemics
Epistemic modalities code the speaker’s qualitative judgement of the proposition.
Speculative judgements indicate that the speaker is uncertain about the factual status
of the proposition, as in Peter may be home already, where may serves to indicate
that the speaker is not certain about whether the proposition holds true. Deductive
judgements indicate that the speaker is inferring something on the basis of external
evidence, as in Peter must be home already (since the lights are on). Deductive judge-
ments tend to imply that the speaker is making a firm judgement; s/he is quite con-
vinced of the truth of the proposition, while a speculative judgement implies a lesser
degree of conviction. An assumptive judgement denotes that the speaker is inferring
something on the basis of what is generally known, as in Peter’ll be home already (be-
cause he’s always home before six o’clock). Here the speaker is making an assumption
based on what is generally known about Peter’s habits. English does not have a spe-
cific marker for assumptive, but expresses the equivalent with the future tense marker
(will) or with the present tense. Wintu is an example of a language with a specific
marker that could be glossed as ‘assumptive’:
		 Wintu (Penutian (Wintuan): USA)
	 (144)	 pi	 kupa-ˀel
		 he	 chop-expect136
		 ‘He is chopping wood.’  (Pitkin 1985:â•›135)
136.â•‡ Pitkin terms â•‚ˀel an “experiential evidential suffix” (1985:â•›135) while Schlichter (1986:â•›51) terms
it ‘expectational’; I am thus using Schlichter’s gloss. Both Pitkin and Schlichter analyse the suffix
as an evidential marker.
220	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
The suffix â•‚ˀel in Example (144) indicates that the speaker expects, or assumes,
that the proposition holds true on the basis of general knowledge. For example, it
would be justified to state that He is chopping wood, using the expectational (or as-
sumptive) suffix â•‚ˀel if “he has a job cutting wood, he usually goes every day between 8
and 5, it is 3 o’clock and yesterday at 3 o’clock he was chopping wood” (Pitkin 1985:â•›135)
or something similar. Notice that this can be analysed as an evidential (and in fact is
in the sources), showing that there are no sharp boundaries between evidentials and
epistemic modalities.
8.5.3	 	 Event modalities
Event modalities have to do with potential action in various ways. The potential events
or actions have not been realized yet, but are possibilities or probabilities. There are
two subcategories of event modality, deontic and dynamic modalities. With deontic
modalities external factors (such as obligation) are those initiating or conditioning
the action, while with dynamic modalities internal factors (such as ability) are those
initiating or conditioning the action.137
8.5.3.1	 Deontics
Deontic modalities have two further subgroups, directives and commissives. Direc-
tives are used when the speaker tries to initiate action, such as stating an obligation,
giving permission or giving an order (an imperative)138. Commissives, on the other
hand, are used when the speaker certifies that an action will take place. An example
of an imperative would be something like Give me that! or Walk!, where the speaker is
giving the addressee a direct order. For a very detailed study on the forms and func-
tions of imperatives and commands, see Aikhenvald (2010).
English does not have a special morphological form for the imperative,139 but in
fact it is much more common to have one: 425 of 547 languages (or 77.7%) in van der
Auwera & Lejeune’s (2011a) sample have a special morphological form for the impera-
tive while 122 (22.3%) do not. Most commonly, languages have different morphological
forms depending on the number of the addressee(s), for example, one for the second
person singular (one addressee) and one for the second person plural (more than one
addressee). This is found in 292 languages in the sample (68.7% of the Â�
languages that
137.â•‡ The term situational modalities covers deontic obligations and permissions and well as dy-
namic abilities, cf., for example van der Auwera & Ammann (2011b).
138.â•‡ Termed ‘speaker oriented’ modalities in Bybee et al. (1994).
139.â•‡ Prosody, however, clearly marks off an imperative from a present tense form.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 221
have special morphological forms for the imperative or 53.4% of the entire sample).
An example of such a language is Comanche, where the imperative has three different
morphological forms.
		 Comanche (Uto-Aztecan (Numic): USA)
	 (145)	 a.	 yu-katɨ
			 quiet-sit(sg.subj)
			 ‘Sit down and be quiet!’ (said to one addressee)
		 b.	 yu-yɨkwi-pɨkwɨh
			 quiet-sit(pl.subj)-du.imp
			 ‘Sit down and be quiet!’ (said to two addressees)
		 c.	 yu-yɨkwi-ka
			 quiet-sit(pl.subj)-pl.imp
			 ‘Sit down and be quiet!’ (said to more than two addressees)
 (Charney 1993:â•›217)
In (145) the imperative differs in two respects according to the number of addressees:
the stem varies according to whether the subject is singular or not (katɨ ‘sit’ is used for
singular subjects while yɨkwi ‘sit’ is used for non-singular subjects); also, an impera-
tive suffix indicating the number of the subjects (â•‚pɨkwɨh for the dual and â•‚ka for the
plural) is required for the non-singular imperatives.
In 42 languages (9.9% of the languages with a special morphological form for the
imperative and 7.7% of the entire sample) there is a special morphological imperative
form for the second person singular, but not for any other number. An example of
such a language is Italian, where the imperative takes a special morphological form
for one addressee, but where it looks like the present tense form if there are two or
more addressees:
		 Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italy)
	 (146)	 a.	 parl-a
			 talk-imp.2sg
			 ‘Talk!’
		 b.	 parl-ate
			 talk-pres.ind.2pl
			 ‘Talk!’/‘You (pl) talk.’  (source: personal knowledge)
A very rare strategy indeed, found in only two languages (0.5% of the languages with a
special morphological form for the imperative and 0.4% of the whole sample), namely
Latvian and Apurinã (Arawakan (Arawakan): Brazil), is to have a special morphologi-
cal form for the second person plural, but not for the second person singular.
222	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Latvian (Indo-European (Baltic): Latvia)
	 (147)	 a.	 dzer
			 drink.pres.ind.2sg
			 ‘Drink!’
		 b.	 dzer-ie-t
			 drink-imp-2pl
			 ‘Drink!’  (Holst 2001:â•›179)
Another strategy, found in 89 languages (20.9% of the languages with a special mor-
phological form for the imperative and 16.3% of the entire sample) is to have a special
morphological form for the imperative that is number neutral, as is the case in Swedish:
		 Swedish (Indo-European (Germanic): Sweden)
	 (148)	 a.	 ät!
			 eat.imp(sg/pl)
			 ‘Eat!’
		 b.	 du/ni	 ät-er
			 2sg/2pl	eat-pres(sg/pl)
			 ‘You (sg/pl) are eating.’  (source: personal knowledge)
The bare form in (148a), ät-Ø ‘eat’, serves as an imperative irrespective of the number
of addressees, while the form in (148b), äter ‘eat’, carries the present tense suffix â•‚er.
The two other directives involve stating obligations or permissions. An example
of a deontic obligative would be something like You must send the letter, where must
denotes that the speaker is trying to initiate action with the addressee by uttering an
obligation. An example of a permissive would be something like You may (/can) go
to the party, where may (or can) indicates that the speaker is giving the addressee
permission for an action. Notice that in English the same markers are used to code
epistemic speculative and deductive judgements as to code deontic obligations and
permissions. Thus must is used both for obligations (You must go now) and for de-
ductive judgements (He must be home already) and may is used both for permissions
(You may go now) and for speculative judgements (He may leave tomorrow). To have
such an overlap between both kinds of epistemic judgements and deontic obligations
and possibilities is actually not too common. In their sample of 207 languages, van
der Auwera & Ammann (2011a) found only 36 (or 17.4%) with markers that code both
epistemic and situational necessity (i.e. epistemic deductive judgements and deontic
obligations) and epistemic and situational possibility (i.e. epistemic speculative judge-
ments and deontic permissions). The majority of these languages form a cluster in Eu-
rope and around the Mediterranean and do not occur at all in either of the Americas.
It is more common, with 66 languages (or 31.9%), to allow some overlap, that is, to
have markers that code either both epistemic and situational necessities, or that code
both epistemic and situational possibilities, but not to have both kinds of overlap.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 223
These languages are spread over the world. The biggest group of the sample, with 105
languages (or 50.7%) spread over the world but with a higher concentration in the
Americas, lack any overlap between the two kinds of markers.
A fourth type of deontic modality is the commissive, where the speaker is certify-
ing (or commits him/herself to ensure) that the action will take place. An example of
a commissive would be something like John shall have the book tomorrow, where the
speaker promises (is committing him/herself) that John will have the book tomor-
row. A commissive may also be a threat, as in You shall do as you’re told or else, where
the speaker is promising (or threatening) that something will happen unless the ad-
dressee does as s/he is told.
8.5.3.2	 Dynamics
While deontic modalities deal with actions initiated due to external factors, dynamic
modalities deal with actions carried out due to internal factors.140 These modalities
can be divided into two subcategories, volitives, which denote willingness on the part
of the subject to carry out an action, and ability, which denotes capacity on the part
of the subject to carry out an action. English does not necessarily distinguish between
the two formally; a sentence like I can do it for you may indicate both willingness and
ability to do something. If distinction is necessary in English, will is used for willing-
ness, as in I will do it for you if I can.
8.6	 TMA in sign languages
It seems to be a universal that sign languages do not have grammatical tense. Instead
time adverbials combined with the unmarked event sign serve to specify when an
event occurred. Consider the following examples:
		 DGS (Sign Language: Germany)
	 (149)	 a.	 MUTTER	 WÄSCHE	 BÜGELN
			 mother	 laundry	 iron
			 ‘Mother is ironing the laundry.’
		 b.	 ENDLICH	 du-PRÜFUNG	 BESTANDEN
			 finally	 you-exam	 pass
			 ‘You’ve finally passed the exam.’
		 c.	 AUSBILDUNG	 BALD	 ANFANGEN
			 training	 soon	 start
			 ‘The training will start soon.’
 (Adapted from Die Brücke zur Welt der Gehörlosen 2001:â•›21)
140.â•‡ Termed ‘agent-oriented’ modalities in Bybee et al. (1994).
224	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In each of the sentences in Example (149) the verb is in its base form, even though
the events described take place at different places on the timeline. Unlike the Eng-
lish translations, there is no temporal information on any of the DGS verbs. In other
words, unless an adverbial or some other contextual information is given, the location
of the event on the timeline is not discernible.
An exception to this universal (or at the very least near-universal) might be Mexi-
can Sign Language (LSM: Mexico), for which claims have been made of systematic
past and future tense/aspect marking, while the present tense remains unmarked. In
his study on the LSM tense and aspect system Fridman-Mintz (2005) shows that the
perfective past is regularly marked with a head-lowering movement and a retention of
the sign at its final location (the Hold segment), while the perfective future is marked
with a head-lowering movement that starts from a Back Head posture (where the
head is tilted backwards before moving forwards) combined with the final long Hold
segment.141 These tense distinctions are only found in the perfective aspect, however,
and not in the imperfective, which is marked differently in its non-manuals (closed
mouth with the corners down and eyebrows in a neutral position) from the perfective
tense/aspect inflections and is tense neutral. Thus the sign EMPACAR[ipfv] ‘pack’ is
tense neutral and may be translated as ‘is/was/will be packing’ depending on context
(Fridman-Mintz 2005:â•›271).
Due to their perfect markers, ISL and ST might constitute two more exceptions
to the tenselessness of sign languages, depending on whether one labels the perfect a
tense or an aspect. The ST marker (glossed as HAP due to the mouth form) has two
morphologically distinct forms, one for a positive utterance (150a) and one for a nega-
tive utterance (150b).
		 ST (Sign Language: Sweden)
	 (150)	 a.	 THIS ONE BOOK HAP READ
			 ‘He has read this book.’
			 ______________________________________neg
		 b.	 HAP-NOT INDEX-c OPEN WINDOW INDEX-c
			 ‘I have not opened the window.’  (Bergman & Dahl 1994:â•›399, 401)
141.â•‡ BSL shows a somewhat similar strategy in that a forward movement of head and shoulders
may be used to indicate that event is located in the future, while a backwards movement of head and
shoulders may be used to indicate that an event is located in the past. However, Sutton-Spence &
Woll argue that this is not an instance of tense marking since “whole phrases and sentences are cov-
ered by these non-manual markers, not only verbs” (1999:â•›117). See also Jacobowitz & Stokoe (1988)
for similar future marking strategies in ASL.
	 Chapter 8.â•‡ Verbal categories	 225
In (150) the perfect marker HAP indicates that the event took place before the refer-
ence point, but is still relevant at that point. In ISL the sign ALREADY functions in a
similar way (Meir 1999). In both ISL and ST the markers indicate only that the event
took place before a reference point (but is still relevant at that point); the reference
point itself is relative and its location on the timeline is determined through context,
such as various time adverbials.
While tense marking is virtually non-existent in the hitherto documented sign
languages, aspect is very common indeed. A common strategy is to express the ha-
bitual or continuative aspects through reduplication.
		 Auslan (Sign Language: Australia)
	 (151)	 a.	 PRO-1	 GO-TO+fast-red	 G-Y-M
			 ‘I go to the gym regularly.’
		 b.	 PRO-1	 WAIT+fast-red	 PRO-2
			 ‘I have been waiting a long time for you.’  (Johnston & Schembri 2009:â•›151)
In Example (151) a sense of duration or repetition is conveyed through the morpho-
logical process of reduplication. This strategy is found in numerous sign languages,
for example ASL (Fischer 1973), ST (Ahlgren & Bergman 2006), and BSL (Sutton-
Spence & Woll 1999), to mention only a few.142
Completive aspect is reported for IPSL, where the functional particle HO_GAYA
indicates that an action or event has been completed (Zeshan 2003c:â•›164). It is pos-
sible that the ISL marker ALREADY could be analysed as a completive marker, as, for
instance the auxiliary FINISH in Auslan (Johnston & Schembri 2009) might also be
argued to be a completive marker, depending on such factors as obligatoriness.
Sign languages also tend to have various modal auxiliaries, such as those found
in Auslan: CAN/CAN’T (two separate signs), MAY, SHOULD, WILL/WON’T (two
separate signs), MUST and NEED (Johnston & Schembri 2009:â•›194) or those found
in BSL: SHOULD, CAN, MUST, WILL (Sutton-Spence & Woll 1999). In BSL, as
in DGS, the difference in obligation indicated between ‘should’ and ‘must’ is cap-
tured through speed and articulation. In BSL “SHOULD-ASK is smaller and less
tense and strong than MUST-ASK” (Sutton-Spence & Woll 1999:â•›126), while in DGS
SHOULD is signed more slowly and loosely than MUST (Die Brücke zur Welt der
Gehörlosen 2001:â•›27).
Imperatives may either be expressed through functional particles or through mor-
phological marking. In IPSL there are three functional particles expressing various
imperatives: KARO ‘neutral positive imperative’, JA:O ‘nonpolite positive Â�
imperative’
142.â•‡ But see Bergman & Dahl (1994) for a discussion on why this is not a case of true aspect but
rather one of ideophones.
226	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
and NAKARO ‘negative imperative’ (Zeshan 2003c:â•›164). With morphologically
marked imperatives in IPSL the sign for the desired action is made with a steady eye-
gaze at the addressee and an optional “o” mouth form (mirroring the â•‚o imperative
suffix of spoken Hindi/Urdu). This is similar to the morphological imperative of ASL,
where the sign of the desired action is made faster and sharper, with a direct eye-gaze
at the addressee (Aikhenvald 2010:â•›37).
	 8.7	 Summary
Some very important verb phrase categories are tense, aspect and mood. Tense is the gram-
matical category that specifies where on a timeline an event is located. Absolute tenses relate
the event to the moment of speech. Relative tenses relate the event to a given reference point.
Languages may also code for remoteness or the degree to which the event is removed the refer-
ence point.
The perfect as a category does not fit neatly into either a tense paradigm or an aspect para-
digm, as it locates an event on the timeline, but also specifies that the event is still relevant at
the given reference point. Perfect in the past places the whole equation before a focus point and
perfect in the future places the equation after a focus point.
Aspect is the grammatical category that specifies the perspective taken on an event. An
event can be conceptualized as having a start and an end point, with a course between these
points. An event may be viewed from within the start and end points, giving various imperfective
aspects, or it may be viewed at or from without the start and end points, as a bounded whole, giv-
ing various perfective aspects. Aspect should not be confused with Aktionsart (actionality).While
the former codes the perspective taken on the event, the latter codes the inherent semantics of
the internal structure of the event.
Mode is the grammatical category that encodes the speaker’s attitude toward a given prop-
osition. The two major categories of mood are realis and irrealis. Realis codes that the event is
a verifiable fact. Irrealis makes no claims as to the factuality of the proposition. The two major
subcategories of modality are propositional modalities, which have to do with information, and
event modalities, which have to do with action. Propositional modalities may be further subcat-
egorized into evidentials, which code the kind of evidence a speaker has for a given proposition,
and epistemics, which code the kinds of judgements a speaker is giving. Event modalities may
either be deontic, where action is influenced through external factors, or they may be dynamic,
where action is influenced through internal factors.
Sign languages typically lack the grammatical category of tense, and instead place events in
time using various time adverbials. A few sign languages have a perfect marker. Aspect is com-
monly found in sign languages, especially habituals and progressives, which tend to be marked
through reduplication. Sign languages also make use of various modal auxiliary verbs to code
epistemic, deontic or directive modalities.

Simple clauses
Clauses need to have a certain number of participants in order to be grammatically
acceptable. The number of necessary participants is determined by the type of verb in
the clause. This number may then be modified through different strategies. The par-
ticipants of a clause are marked in various ways in the different types of clauses. This
chapter discusses some basic issues on clause participants and valency. Section 9.1
brings up the core semantic, pragmatic and syntactic roles participants may have in a
clause, and discusses the types of argument alignments found in the world and index-
ing of arguments on the verb. Section 9.2 deals with valency, the number of obligatory
participants a clause must have, and how valency may be adjusted in various ways. In
9.3 I bring up some issues related to simple clauses in sign languages.
9.1	 Clause participants
A sentence will consist minimally of a predicate and the arguments of that predicate
to form a proposition.143 Typically, the predicate minimally consists of a verb, which
is the crucial element that determines the structure of the proposition. The arguments
are typically realized by noun phrases, which fill the structural slots laid out by the
verb in the proposition. For example, in the sentence John threw the ball, there is a
verb (signifying the act of throwing) and two arguments, one entity that does the
throwing (John) and one entity that gets thrown (the ball). Verbs differ in how many
arguments they require. A verb like throw needs two arguments, while a verb like
run only needs one; while John ran is perfectly acceptable and the destination is not
obligatory to specify, a sentence like ??John threw would only work in extremely spe-
cific contexts and would normally require that we specify what got thrown. A verb
like give normally requires three arguments, the entity giving something, that which
is being given, and the recipient of the gift, as in John gave Mary a ball.
The participants that are necessary to make a sentence grammatical can be called
core participants (or arguments). They are the subject, direct and indirect objects, de-
pending on what the verb requires. Sentences may also contain participants that are not
obligatory for the sentence to be grammatical, peripheral participants (or adjuncts).
143.â•‡ Below we will see that predicates may also be without arguments (zero arguments).
230	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
For example, John ran contains one core participant (argument), the subject (John),
while John ran to the bus stop contains one core participant (John) and one peripheral
participant (to the bus stop). In John gave Mary a ball we have the three core participants
subject (John), direct object (a ball) and indirect object (Mary), while in John gave Mary
a ball for her birthday we also have a peripheral participant (for her birthday). The sen-
tences would not be grammatical without their core participants, whereas they are still
grammatical if we leave out the peripheral participant; compare *___ ran (core partici-
pant missing) with John ran ___ (peripheral participant missing) and *___ gave Mary a
ball / *John gave Mary ___ / ??John gave ___ a ball (a core participant missing) with John
gave Mary a ball ___ (peripheral participant missing). For more on core participants
(arguments) and peripheral participants (adjuncts), see 9.2 below.
In all the sentences above the noun phrases have various semantic roles and gram-
matical relations. For instance, John is consistently an active participant of the act (he
runs, throws, gives) and is also consistently the subject of each sentence, while the ball
is consistently a passive participant of the act (it gets thrown and gets given) and is also
consistently an object of the sentence. However, if we say The ball was kicked by John,
then the ball becomes the subject even though it retains its role as a passive participant
of the proposition. In the same way, the semantic role of the candle as an instrumental
stays the same in the two sentences Mary lit the room with a candle and The candle lit
the room, even though is it an object in the first sentence and a subject in the second.
This shows that semantic roles and grammatical relations do not necessarily overlap
and that, in fact, it makes sense to view the two as separate linguistic domains that
may interact in various ways. Semantic roles specify the underlying relationship that
arguments have with their verbs in terms of how they develop the meaning of the
clause or sentence. Grammatical relations specify the relationship between the argu-
ments and the verb in terms of the syntactic function that they carry in the clause or
sentence. Furthermore, the arguments of a proposition can have different pragmatic
roles, depending on how they reflect the flow of the information given in the clause or
sentence. The following sections will give brief definitions of some general terms and
concepts that will serve as a background for the discussion in this and the following
chapters. For a thorough overview of the various functions of the noun phrase in the
clause, see Andrews (2007b).
9.1.1	 	 Semantic roles
As mentioned, semantic roles (also called thematic roles or theta (θ) roles) denote
the roles that participants play in a given situation. It is important to keep in mind
that semantic roles do not denote any inherent properties of the participants but that
they specify what role the participants have in relation to the verb. Languages differ as
to how they may code various semantic roles or how they may be grouped together.
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 231
In principle one could argue that a semantic role is a conceptual notion and that the
roles of participants in each situation are unique and therefore subtly different from
the roles in any other situation, which would yield an infinite amount of semantic
roles. This is, strictly speaking, true, but also in a sense irrelevant and, above all, not
helpful for linguistic descriptions. Of all the infinite situations available to us, there
are some common features that can be used as a basis for delimiting a smaller number
of typical semantic roles that tend to occur in languages and tend to be grammatically
marked in some way. This section will give examples of some common semantic roles
but makes no claims whatsoever of being an exhaustive list of all potential semantic
roles that can be found across languages. It is important to bear in mind that there
are no absolute boundaries between the labels, but rather that they constitute more
or less well-defined clusters along a continuum of such semantic notions as control
and action, where, for example, the cluster on one end typically denotes entities with
a high degree of control that instigate action and the cluster on the other end typically
denotes entities that have a low degree of control and do not wilfully engage in any
action. In the sentence John kicked the ball, for example, John is an entity with a high
degree of control instigating action while the ball is an entity with a low degree of
control undergoing that action.
A prototypical agent is the entity that performs an action and has a high degree of
control. An example of an agent would be Mary in Mary opened the door with the key.
There is often an element of volition (that the act has been carried out on purpose),
although that would be lacking in non-conscious entities such as natural forces, as
in The wind blew open the door, where it is questionable whether The wind could be
argued to act through volition. In some cases it might thus be justified to distinguish
between agent and force, where the latter is a non-conscious instigator of action.
A prototypical instrument is an entity which is used to perform an action. Very
often an agent uses an instrument as a tool to carry out the action, as in Mary opened
the door with the key, where the key is the instrument. Notice, however, that in the sen-
tence The key opened the door the instrument (the key) remains the same even though
its grammatical relation is now that of subject. The instrument typically does not have
conscious control, but is merely a tool being used for an action.
A prototypical experiencer is an entity getting cognitive stimulus one way or an-
other. An example of an experiencer would be the cat in The cat saw the mouse. The
difference between an experiencer and an agent is one of control and volition: while
an agent typically consciously performs an action, the experiencer typically does not
have control of the cognitive stimulus that it receives. Compare the sentences Mary
saw the mouse and Mary looked at the mouse. In the former Mary became aware of the
mouse through the sense of sight but may or may not have wished to become aware
of it. In the latter Mary chooses to look at the mouse. Thus, in the former sentence,
232	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Mary is rather an experiencer than an agent, while in the latter she is rather an agent
than an experiencer.
A prototypical recipient is an entity receiving something. An example of a recipi-
ent would be John in the sentence Mary gave the book to John. The role of recipient
is not entirely overlapping with benefactive, which prototypically is an entity that
benefits from an action (but might not receive anything), such as I hung the laundry
for Mary, where Mary is the benefactive.
A prototypical patient has very little or no control and volition and is the entity
affected by the action. An example of a patient would be the door in the sentence Mary
opened the door. Other examples would be The door opened (no control, no volition),
Mary fell (no control, no volition), John pushed Mary (Mary is the patient with mini-
mal control), and so on.
A prototypical theme is an entity which changes location or to which a location
is assigned. An example of a sentence with a theme would be Mary gave the book to
John, where the book is the theme.
The above-mentioned semantic roles are often expressed as subjects, objects or
indirect objects (see below). The following are more often expressed as adverbials or
obliques (optional arguments or participants).
A prototypical comitative is the entity accompanying someone or something, as
in John went to the beach with the dog, where (with) the dog is the comitative. A proto-
typical purpose (or purposive) is an entity which is the reason for an action, as in John
went out for the newspaper, where (for) the newspaper is the purpose.
A prototypical locative is the entity expressing the point in space for an event or
entity, as in Mary opened the door in the hall, where (in) the hall is the locative. A pro-
totypical goal is the entity expressing the end point for a motion, as in John took the
bus to school, where (to) school is the goal, while a prototypical source is the origin of
a motion, as in Mary came in from the balcony, where (from) the balcony is the source.
A prototypical temporal is a noun phrase expressing the point in time for an ac-
tion or event, as in John went out for groceries at noon/in the morning/at ten o’clock,
where (at) noon/(in) the morning/(at) ten o’clock express the temporal semantic roles.
9.1.2	 	 Pragmatic roles
We must always keep in mind that language is used in a social context of speakers,
addressees, and people or events far removed either in time or place; in spontane-
ous utterances or carefully prepared narratives or formalized rituals or anything in
between. These social contexts include shared sociocultural knowledge and other
shared information, such as in terms of previous speech or other kinds of background
knowledge. In other words, languages are very rarely (if ever) employed to just ran-
domly throw out sentences. Rather, humans use language in a structured manner,
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 233
maximizing the coherence of the message or information they are trying to get across.
Pragmatics deals with how this practical use of language manifests itself linguistically.
For thorough discussions on discourse strategies, see, for example, Kärkkäinen et al.
(2007) and Gumperz (1982), the latter of which is a classic by now. For a very thorough
overview on pragmatics in general, see Levinson (1983), another classic piece of work.
A very accessible introduction to pragmatics for the beginner is Yule (1996). Chap-
ter 12 gives a further discussion of speech acts and similar topics.
Very simplified, pragmatic roles describe the status of the information given in
a sentence or clause. Languages have various ways of presenting essentially the same
information from different perspectives. For instance, in the two sentences Bill opened
the door and The door was opened by Bill, the same basic information is given, namely
that Bill engaged in the act of opening the door. The difference lies in how that in-
formation is presented, or packaged. The first sentence is mainly about Bill and what
he did, while the second sentence is mainly about the door and what happened to it.
Pragmatic roles thus denote how the sentence is structured in terms of information
status and information packaging. For a very thorough discussion on information
packaging, see Foley (2007). For a detailed discussion on pragmatic roles in general,
see Lambrecht (1994).
The topic (or theme) is essentially the entity about which something is said, i.e.
what the sentence is about. The rest of the sentence is a comment on the topic. Thus
the topic in Bill opened the door is Bill while opened the door is the comment. Simi-
larly, the topic in The door was opened by Bill is the door, while was opened by Bill is
the comment. Prototypically, the topic represents old or already known information
that does not need further highlighting. In other words, the topic “prototypically de-
notes a presupposed established entity” (Foley 2007:â•›405) in a context which consti-
tutes shared information between the speaker and the addressee. Topics tend to be
grammatical subjects, which in a sense is rather straightforward, since subjects tend
to be the central participants in a clause (see below). This should not be taken to imply
that topics and subjects are the same categories, even though there is a high degree
of overlap. For a thorough discussion on the pragmatic role of topic and its interplay
with the grammatical relations of subject and object, see Lambrecht (1994:â•›131ff) and
Dalrymple & Nikolaeva (2011) with further references.
A sentence can have more than one topic. The primary topic is the more impor-
tant entity, while the secondary topic is the entity that stands in some relationship
with the primary topic. The utterance as a whole is about this relationship (Nikolaeva
2001). Consider the following:
	 (152)	 a.	 Whatever became of Jenny?
		 b.	 She married Peter,
		 c.	 and she’s still deeply in love with him.
234	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (152b) we have a comment (married Peter) on the topic she, which refers to Jenny.
In (152c) we have two topics, she (i.e. Jenny) and him (i.e. Peter) and the utterance is
about the relationship between these two entities. The sentence is primarily about
Jenny, thus making her the primary topic, but it also adds information about Peter,
making him a secondary topic. Givón (e.g. 1984 and 2001a and previous) has argued
that the primary topic is the origin of the grammatical relation subject while the sec-
ondary topic is the origin of the grammatical relation direct object. For more on gram-
matical relations, see 9.1.3 below.
The focus (or rheme) constitutes new, not previously established (or at least
presupposed not to be previously established) information about the topic. In other
words, the focus constitutes information that is added to the pool of shared knowl-
edge. It can be part of the comment, or even constitute the whole comment. In fact,
an entire clause can function as focus, if it consists entirely of new information. This
is easiest to illustrate by means of question and answer dialogues, where the focus is
underlined:
	 Q: 	 Who opened the door?
	 A: 	 Bill opened the door.
	 Q: 	 What did Bill open?
	 A: 	 He opened the door.
	 Q: 	 What happened?
	 A: 	 Bill opened the door.
Notice that in a real-life dialogue the answers could have consisted of only the focus,
while that information which is shared between the speaker and the addressee does
not have to be repeated in order to get across the relevant new information:
	 Q: 	 Who opened the door?
	 A: 	 Bill.
	 Q: 	 What did Bill open?
	 A: 	 The door.
	 Q: 	 What happened?
	 A: 	 Bill opened the door.
What is crucial to keep in mind here is that information packaging may take various
shapes, and consist of different pragmatic roles, depending on a multitude of fac-
tors, such as the flow of a narrative and how much information can be presupposed
to be shared.
Pragmatic roles are very commonly marked through intonation. In English, for
example, a focused element tends to be stressed, as in Who opened the door? Bill
opened the door, where Bill is the focus (with the stress indicated in bold). Other ways
of pragmatically marking an element may be through fronting, where the focused
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 235
Â�
element is placed at the beginning of the sentence. Compare, for example, the sen-
tences I like roses with Roses, I like. In the latter sentence the focused element (roses)
has been placed at the very beginning of the sentence, it has been fronted. Yet another
way of pragmatically marking an element is through a cleft construction, where, very
simplified, focus is achieved by expressing the sentence as a relative clause in which a
noun phrase (NPi) and the relativized NP are coreferential (see 11.2.3 for more on rela-
tive clauses). In English this expressed as NPi be [… NPi…]Relative clause, as in It is roses
that I like, where It is NPi and roses the relativized NP which is coreferential with NPi.
The NPi is typically referred to as the clefted constituent and is commonly, though
not always, placed furthest to the left of the clause.
9.1.3	 	 Grammatical relations and alignment
Grammatical relations (or syntactic roles) are formal categories that signal the syn-
tactic function an argument has in the clause or sentence. In other words, they are
formal categories for expressing what function a participant has in a given situation
or proposition. Languages tend to have up to three distinct grammatical relations, tra-
ditionally termed subject, object (or direct object) and indirect object, the occurrence
of which is largely dependent on the transitivity of the verb. In subsequent sections we
will see that these are not adequate categories to capture the various core grammatical
functions found in languages of the world, which are better captured by the three core
semantico-syntactic functions S, A and P.144 For an accessible overview on grammati-
cal relations from different theoretical perspectives, see Farrell (2005). For thorough
discussions on grammatical relations typology, see, for example, Givón (2001a:â•›173ff),
Andrews (2007b), Dryer (2007a) and Bickel (2010). For a classic on the definition of
the subject, see Keenan (1976).
9.1.3.1	 Subjects and objects
Grammatical relations tend to have a set of formal properties. The overt coding proper-
ties refer to the “perceptually discernible features of the grammatical code such as mor-
phology, intonation and word order” (Givón 2001a:â•›175). The overt coding properties
typically relevant for grammatical relations are word order, nominal morphology and
verb agreement. The behaviour-and-control properties refer to the syntactic processes
that are governed by grammatical relations. In principle this refers to any process that
answers Yes to the question “[d]oes one have to mention the subject and/or direct-object
144.â•‡ Dixon (e.g. 1979 and 1994; cf. also Foley & Van Valin 1984) has argued that the notion of syn-
tactic pivot better captures why languages group participants in a certain way. The syntactic pivot
is, put very simply, the argument around which the rest of the sentence revolves. In many languages
(especially those with a nominative-accusative alignment, see 9.1.3.3), the subject is the syntactic
pivot of the sentence.
236	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
G[rammatical] R[elation] in describing the grammatical behaviour of a particular con-
struction?” (Givón 2001a:â•›178). An example of a behaviour-and-control process is pas-
sivization, which can be described as a construction where the direct object is promoted
to the subject of the clause, as in John threw the ball (direct object) passivized into The
ball (subject) was thrown. (For more on passive constructions, see 9.2.2.1 below.)
The subject is the central, most prominent, noun phrase in the clause and tradi-
tionally defined as the “doer” of an action, or the entity which carries out the action
expressed by the verb. While this may overlap with the semantic role of agent, the two
are not identical. Recall, for example, that different semantic roles may fill the subject
position (underlined), as in The man (agent) opened the door with a key, The key (in-
strument) opened the door, and The door (patient) opened; in the three sentences an
agent, an instrument, and a patient respectively fill the grammatical slot of the subject.
In English the position of a participant in a clause with respect to the other partici-
pants signals which grammatical relation the participant has. In Mary phoned John,
for example, we know that the NP Mary is the subject (Mary is the “doer”) because of
its placement in the clause: subjects come before the verb in English. For more on how
different languages order the participants in the clause, see Chapter 10. Nominal mor-
phology (especially case marking, see 7.1.3) may also be used to signal the grammati-
cal relation of a participant. In English this is evident only in the pronominal system:
in the sentence She phoned John we know that she is the subject of the clause because
of the morphological form of the NP. Something like *Her phoned John would not be
acceptable. In languages with case systems the subject is typically in the nominative
or ergative case. Very often the verb carries overt markers indexing such properties as
person and number of the subject, known as verb agreement (see below, 9.1.3.5). In
English, for instance, the verb agrees with the subject, but no other participant: in The
man shoots ducks the verb agrees in person and number with the subject (3rd person
singular â•‚s). Something like *The man shoot ducks, where the verb agrees with the
object (ducks), is not possible.
The object is basically the core argument of the verb which is not a subject and is
traditionally defined as the “recipient” or “undergoer” of an action. Again, while this
may overlap with various semantic roles, the two are not identical. And again, the
formal coding properties of word order, nominal morphology and verb agreement
signal the grammatical relation of the argument. In English, for example, the object
comes after the verb: in Mary phoned John we know that the NP John is the object (“re-
cipient” or “undergoer”) because of its placement in the clause. Nominal morphology
may also mark objects; in English this is evident with pronouns, where something like
Mary phoned him is acceptable but *Mary phoned he is not. In languages with case
systems the object is typically in the accusative, ablative or dative case.
With verbs that demand two objects a distinction is often made between di-
rect and indirect objects. A direct object is traditionally defined as the “undergoer”
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 237
or patient or theme of the action, while the indirect object is traditionally defined
as the “recipient” or “addressee” of the action. For instance, the verb sell requires
that someone does the selling (subject) of something that gets sold (direct object)
to someone (indirect object). Most commonly languages make a formal distinction
between direct and indirect objects. In English the indirect may be formally differen-
tiated from the direct object, as in John gave the book to Mary, there the preposition
to indicates that Mary is the indirect object. However a sentence like John gave Mary
the book, where no formal differentiation is made, is equally acceptable. Languages
with case systems often, but by no means always, use different cases for direct and
indirect objects.
9.1.3.2	 Transitivity
The above discussion has consistently referred to arguments needed by the verb
and the number of participants in a clause. Transitivity is the category that specifies
whether or not a verb can take an object. Verbs fall into different classes, the major
divide being between those that can take object(s) and those that cannot. Thus an
intransitive (which literally means “not transitive”) verb has only one participant,
the subject. An example of a transitive verb would be sleep, as in John/The man slept,
where John or The man is the only participant (subject). Something like *John slept
something is not acceptable. A transitive (from Latin transire ‘to carry over’) verb, on
the other hand, has two participants that stand in some kind of relationship to each
other, typically in that the subject acts on the object somehow (an act is “carried over”
from the subject to the object). An example of a transitive verb would be kill, as in
The man killed a fly, where The man is the subject and a fly is the object. Something
like *The man killed is not acceptable (or at the very least, would only be acceptable
in highly specific contexts). A ditransitive (literally “two-transitive”) verb takes two
objects, which means that the clause has three participants in total. An example of
a ditransitive verb would be sell, as in John sold the house to Mary, where John is the
subject, the house is the direct object, and Mary is the indirect object.
9.1.3.3	 Subject alignment
The discussion above shows that one way of defining subjects is that they are the sole
arguments of intransitive verbs. It might seem straightforward to go further and define
subjects as not only the sole argument of intransitive verbs, but also the primary argu-
ment of transitive verbs. After all, the subjects, in English, look the same in both cases:
	 (153)	 a.	 He went.
			 S	 V
		 b.	 He saw him.
			 S	 V	 O
238	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (153) the subjects formally look the same even though the first sentence is intran-
sitive and the second transitive. The form of the object is never possible to use in a
subject position; something like *Him went is not acceptable. Clearly, then, the subject
seems to occupy the slot of the primary argument of any verb. But now consider the
following example:
		 Pitjantjatjara (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia)
	 (154)	 a.	 minyma-ngku	 tjitji	 nya-ngu
			 woman-erg	 child-Ø(abs)	 see-past
			 S	 O	 V
			 ‘The woman saw the child.’
		 b.	 tjitji	 a-nu
			 child-Ø(abs)	 go-past
			 S	 V
			 ‘The child went.’
		 c.	 tjitji-ngku	 minyma	 nya-ngu
			 child-erg	 woman-Ø(abs)	 see-past
			 S	 O	 V
			 ‘The child saw the woman.’  (Bowe 1990:â•›10)
In (154a and c) we have transitive clauses with the two arguments subject (minymangku
‘woman.ergative’ and tjitjingku ‘child.ergative’ respectively) and object (tjitji ‘child’
and minyma ‘woman’ respectively), while in (154b) we have an intransitive clause with
only one argument, the subject (tjitji ‘child’). Notice, however, that the subjects do not
always look formally the same: in the transitive clauses the subjects consistently have
the ergative case ending â•‚ngku but in the intransitive clause the subject has no ending
at all (it is in the absolutive case). In fact, the form of the subject in the intransitive
clause is identical with the form of the objects in the transitive clauses!
Because languages have different systems of grouping (aligning) the core argu-
ments of intransitive and transitive clauses, it makes more sense to differentiate these
three arguments as follows: the subject (S) is the single argument of an intransitive
clause – the position occupied by He in (153b) and tjitji in (154b); minyamangku and
tjitjingku in (154a) and (154c) respectively are the most agent-like arguments of the
clause and as such may be labelled agents (A); while the position occupied by him
in (153b) and tjitji and minyma in (154a and c) respectively are the most patient-like
arguments of the clause and as such may be labelled patients (P).145 In other words,
in order to be able to better capture what is going on, we make use of terms relating
both to grammatical relations (subject) and to semantic roles (agent and patient) to
145.â•‡ While it is more common to use the symbol P for the argument occupying the most patient-
like slot of a transitive clause, the symbol O (for object) is sometimes also used, as in Dixon (1994).
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 239
describe the semantico-syntactic alignment of arguments in different languages; we
may think of them as participant roles.
There are five logical ways of aligning S, A and P, the core arguments of intransi-
tive and transitive clauses, as illustrated in Figure 9.1.

Figure 9.1â•‡ The five logical possibilities of aligning the arguments S, A and P.
In a nominative-accusative (or accusative) system, S and A are grouped together
in that they are marked in the same way, while P is marked differently. The example
above demonstrates how English pronouns show an accusative alignment. Hungarian
is an example of a language where full noun phrases have an accusative system, with
the S and A both in the nominative case (â•‚Ø) and P in the accusative (â•‚et):
		 Hungarian (Uralic (Ugric): Hungary)
	 (155)	 a.	 a	 lány-Ø	 áll
			 the	 girl-Ø	 stand.indefoc.3sg
				 S
			 ‘The girl is standing.’
		 b.	 a	 lány-Ø	 ir-ja	 a	 level-et
			 the	 girl-Ø	 write-defoc.3sg	 the	 letter-acc
				 A			 P
			 ‘The girl is writing the letter.’  (Kenesei et al. 1998:â•›195)
In Comrie’s (2011a) sample of 190 languages, 52 (27.4%) are accusative, spread all over
the world except Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea. Most commonly accusative
languages either have overt marking for both the nominative and the accusative or an
overt marker for the accusative only (as in the Hungarian example above). However
in six languages (3.2% of the entire sample) in the sample the nominative is overtly
marked while the accusative is unmarked. Murle is an example of such a language:
		 Murle (Nilo-Saharan (Surmic): Sudan)
	 (156)	 a.	 adokony	 ɛɛt-i
			 runs	 man-nom
				 S
			 ‘The man runs.’
Accusative	 Ergative	 Tripartite	 Neutral	 Double-oblique
240	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
	 (156)	 b.	 agam	 kayuu-wi	 kulugit-Ø
			 catches	 eagle-nom	 fish-Ø(acc)
				 A	 P
			 ‘The eagle catches a fish.’  (Arensen 1982:â•›50,â•›139)
In (156) both S and A have overt nominative marking (â•‚(w)i) while P is in the un-
marked accusative. This is still an accusative system, however, since the crucial fact
is that S and A are treated the same way while P is treated differently. Since full noun
phrases and pronouns might behave differently in terms of alignment (as is the case
with English, for instance, compare Example (153) with the discussion on neutral sys-
tems below), Comrie (2011b) treated pronouns in a separate survey. Of 172 languages,
64 (37.2%) have an accusative system. Three (1.7% of the entire sample), Aymara (Ay-
maran (Aymaran): Bolivia), Igbo and Maricopa, have a marked nominative and an
unmarked accusative, as they do with full noun phrases. Murle and Harar Oromo
have a marked nominative for full noun phrases, but a standard accusative system for
pronouns, and Middle Atlas Berber has a marked nominative for full noun phrases
but a neutral system (see below) for pronouns.
In an ergative-absolutive (or ergative) system S and P are marked in the same
way while A is marked differently. Pitjantjatjara, as shown above, is an example of
a language with an ergative system. Epena Pedee is an example of a language where
both the full noun phrases and the pronouns have an ergative system.
		 Epena Pedee (Choco (Choco): Colombia)
	 (157)	 a.	 josé-Ø	 khāi-hí
			 PN-Ø	 sleep-past
			 S
			 ‘José slept.’
		 b.	 josé-pa	 pháta-Ø	 kho-hí
			 PN-erg	 plantain-Ø	 eat-past
			 A	 P
			 ‘José ate (the) plantain.’
		 c.	 mɨ́-Ø	 khāi-ithée
			 1sg-Ø	 sleep-fut
			 S
			 ‘I will sleep.’
		 d.	 mɨ́-a	 pháta-Ø	 kho-hí
			 1sg-erg	 plantain-Ø	 eat-past
			 A	 P
			 ‘I ate (the) plantain.’
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 241
		 e.	 mɨ́-Ø	 pee-wa-da	 a-hí	 na	 imamá-pa
			 1sg-Ø	 kill-prog-decl	 say-past	 this	 tiger-erg
			 P					 A
			 ‘â†œ“This tiger is killing me!” he said.’  (Harms 1994:â•›9,â•›22,â•›45,â•›69,â•›87)
In (157a and b) we see that the S is unmarked, just as the P is (josé-Ø and pháta-Ø
respectively) while the A is treated differently, marked with the ergative suffix (josé-
pa). The personal pronoun mɨ́ ‘I’ behaves in the same way, remaining unmarked in
the S and P slots (Examples (c) and (e)) while carrying the ergative suffix in the A slot
(Example (d)). In Comrie’s two surveys (2011a and b) 32 of 190 languages (16.8%) have
an ergative system for full noun phrases and 20 of 172 languages (11.6%) have an erga-
tive system for their pronouns. While languages with an ergative system in Comrie’s
samples are spread globally, they are completely absent in Africa, and almost com-
pletely absent in Europe and on the northern part of the Eurasian landmass (Basque
and Chukchi being the respective exceptions).
In a tripartite system S, A and P are all marked differently. This is very rare cross-
linguistically and is found in only four languages (2.1%) in Comrie’s (2011a) survey
on full noun phrases: Hindi, Marathi (Indo-European (Indic): India), Nez Perce (Pe-
nutian (Sahaptian): USA) and Semelai (Austro-Asiatic (Aslian): Malaysia). All but
Marathi also have a tripartite system for the pronouns (while the pronouns in Marathi
have an accusative system). In Nez Perce, for example, the S is unmarked while the A
carries an ergative suffix (â•‚nim/â•‚nm/â•‚m) and the P carries a direct object suffix (â•‚ne),
as shown in Example (158).
		 Nez Perce (Penutian (Sahaptian): USA)
	 (158)	 a.	 kaa	 wáago	 hi-x̣íic’em-ne	 háama-Ø
			 and	 now	 3.nom-be.angry-pfv	 man-Ø
						 S
			 ‘And now the man became angry.’
		 b.	 ‘iceyéeye-nm	 x̣áx̣aas-na	 hi-náas-wapci’yaw-na
			 coyote-erg	 grizzly-do	 3nom-pldo-kill-pfv
			 A	 P
			 ‘Coyote killed the grizzlies.’  (Rude 1985:â•›83,â•›88)
The most common system in Comrie’s (2011a and 2011b) samples is the neutral sys-
tem, where S, A and P all look the same. It is generally found in languages with little or
no morphological marking. English is an example of a neutral system in the full noun
phrases (though not with pronouns, see above): the NP carries no overt marking to
indicate what syntactic function it has in the clause. Instead, that is determined by the
word order. For instance, in the sentences John (S) slept and John (A) called Bill (P),
the arguments are all unmarked. Another example of a language with a neutral system
is Koromfe, where again all the arguments are unmarked.
242	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Koromfe (Niger-Congo (Gur): Burkina Faso, Mali)
	 (159)	 a.	 a	 hem	 koŋ	 gɔl
			 art	 water(sg)	 det.nhum.sg	 boil

		 b.	 bʌdini	 homs	 a	 hem	 koŋ
			 PN	 heat	 art	 water(sg)	 det.nhum.sg
			 A			 P
			 ‘Badini boils the water.’  (Rennison 1997:â•›268)
In Comrie’s sample mapped for full noun phrases, 98 of 190 (or 51.6%) languages have
a neutral system, while in the sample mapped for pronouns 79 languages (or 45.9%)
have a neutral system. These languages are spread all over the world, but concentrate
in the areas where languages have little or no morphological marking or where most
of the morphological marking occurs on the verb.
The fifth logical possibility of subject argument alignment is that A and P look
the same while S looks different, called double-oblique (or sometimes “accusative-
focus”, cf. for example, Whaley 1997:â•›158). This is exceedingly rare and is only known
to occur in a few Iranian languages of the Pamir region, specifically with Rushan
(Indo-European (Iranian): Tajikistan) pronouns in clauses of the past tenses, although
there have been reports of a double-oblique system for both full noun phrases and
pronouns in Pashai (Indo-European (Iranian): Afghanistan) (Skalmowski 1974).

In (160a and b) the pronouns (mu ‘I, me’ and tā ‘you’ respectively) look exactly the
same irrespective of whether they function as A arguments or P arguments. In other
146.â•‡ Intransitive verb stems show gender and number alternations in the various tenses that refer
to the past.
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 243
words, A and P are ambiguous here. However, when the pronoun functions as an S
argument, i.e. as the sole argument of an intransitive clause, it takes a different form,
namely az. Furthermore, the verb agreement suffix only appears on the S, here the
first person marker â•‚um. This double-oblique system is in fact reflecting an intermedi-
ate stage in an ongoing shift from an ergative system to an accusative system.147
The languages in APiCS present a rather different picture, as shown in Table 9.1.

It thus seems that pidgins and creoles are much less likely to have an ergative system
than non-creoles, and that pidgins and creoles are more likely than non-creoles to
have a neutral system for their full noun phrases but an accusative system for their
pronouns.
147.â•‡ The actual path of development is quite a bit more complicated than that: the Old Persian ac-
cusative system developed into an ergative system when the passive particle got reanalysed as an
active verb. This ergative system has now largely been lost again in favour of the accusative system
due to language contact, but various intermediate stages in the Pamir languages have led to this
double-oblique system, which is still partly found in Rushan. See further Payne (1980 and 1989). For
an accessible overview of the intense and complex contact situation involved in the various stages
of the Iranian languages, see Utas (2009). For more on contact-induced language change, see 13.2.

the WALS sample have been taken out, which is why the figure for WALS differ slightly here from
those earlier in the text.

150.â•‡ This refers to split systems (see 9.1.3.6 below). The added value ‘none’ in Comrie’s survey on
pronoun alignment has been ignored here. The languages for this value are Wari’, Wichita and Cane-
la-Krahô (Macro-Ge (Ge-Kaingang): Brazil).
244	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
9.1.3.4	 Object alignment
Languages may also differ in how they align the objects of a ditransitive clause. In
a ditransitive clause we have three arguments, the subject, the direct object and the
indirect object. Or, more exactly, we have three participant roles: the agent-like argu-
ment (A) discussed above, the recipient-like argument (R) and the theme-like argu-
ment (T). An example of a ditransitive construction is:
	 (161)	 John	 gave Mary	 a flower
		 A	 R		 T
In (161) John is the agent-like argument, Mary is the recipient-like argument and a
flower is the theme-like argument. For a detailed and very accessible overview of di-
transitive constructions, see Malchukov et al. (2010a) with references, which serves as
the introduction to Malchukov et al. (2010b), where a collection of studies on ditransi-
tive constructions in different languages can be found.
Languages differ in whether and how they encode the R and T arguments of a di-
transitive construction compared to the P argument of a monotransitive construction.
There are five logical ways of aligning the R and T arguments, as illustrated in Figure 9.2:
Indirective

Tripartite

Figure 9.2â•‡ The five logical possibilities of aligning the arguments P, T and R.
In an indirective alignment the T of a ditransitive verb is treated in the same way as
the P of a monotransitive verb. German is an example of a language with indirective
alignment:
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (162)	 a.	 Der	 Mann	 kaufte	 den	 Ball
			 art.nom.sg	 man	 bought	 art.acc.sg	 ball
				 A			 P
			 ‘The man bought the ball.’
		 b.	 Der	 Mann	 gab	 dem	 Kind	 den	 Ball
			 art.nom.sg	 man	 gave	 art.dat.sg	 child	 art.acc.sg	 ball
				 A		 R			 T
			 ‘The man gave the child the ball.’  (source: personal knowledge)
Indirective	 Secundative	 Tripartite	 Neutral	 Horizontal
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 245
In the ditransitive construction in (162b) the T (den Ball ‘the ball’) is encoded in
the same way as the P of the monotransitive construction in (162a) (den Ball ‘the ball’).
This is the most common strategy in Haspelmath’s (2011a) sample, where 189 of 378
languages (or 50%) have an indirect alignment.
In a secundative alignment it is the R of a ditransitive verb that is encoded in the
same way as the P of a monotransitive verb, as in Kham:
		 Kham (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): Nepal)
	 (163)	 a.	 ŋa:-Ø	 no:-lai	 ŋa-rɨ̃:h-ke
			 1sg-nom	 3sg-obj	 1sg-see-pfv
			 A	 P
			 ‘I saw him.’
		 b.	 ŋa:-lai	 bəhtanji	 y-ā:-ke-o
			 1sg-obj	 potato	 give-1sg-pfv-3sg
			 R		 T				 A
			 ‘He gave me a potato.’  (Watters 2002:â•›67f)
In (163b) the recipient-like argument (ŋa:lai) of the ditransitive construction carries
the object marker â•‚lai just as the patient-like argument of the monotransitive con-
struction in (163a) does (no:lai). This alignment strategy is found in 66 (17.5%) lan-
guages in Haspelmath’s sample.
In a neutral alignment (also called double-object alignment) P, R and T are all
encoded the same way:
		 Hdi (Afro-Asiatic (Biu-Mandara): Nigeria)
	 (164)	 a.	 ǹghà-n-ǹgh-í	 tá	 krì
			 see-3-see-1sg	 obj	 dog
					 A			 P
			 ‘I saw a dog.’
		 b.	 vlá-n-vl-í	 tá	 xə̀n	 tá	 kóɓù
			 give-3-give-1sg	 obj	 3pl	 obj	 money
						 A		 R			 T
			 ‘I give them money.’ (Frajzyngier & Shay 2002:â•›180,â•›182)
In (164) the R and the T (xə̀n ‘them’ and kóɓù ‘money’ respectively) of the ditransitive
construction in (b) are both marked with the object marker tá, as is the P (krì) of the
monotransitive construction in (a). This alignment strategy is found in 83 languages
(22%) of Haspelmath’s (2011a) sample.
In a tripartite alignment P, T and R are all encoded differently. This is very rare
(Malchukov et al. 2010a), but can be found in Kayardild:
246	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Kayardild (Australian (Tangkic): Australia)
	 (165)	 a.	 ngarrka-ngku	 ka	 yankirri	 luwa-rni
			 man-erg	 pres	 emu.abs	 shoot-npst
			 A			 P
			 ‘The man is shooting the emu.’
		 b.	 maku	 dun-maru-tha	 wuu-ja	 nguku-wuru
			 woman.nom	 spouse-vd-act	 give-act	 water-prop
			 A		 R			 T
			 ‘A woman gives water to her spouse.’  (Evans 1995:â•›139,â•›336)
In (165) the P (yankirri ‘emu’) of the monotransitive construction in (a) is marked in
the ablative case, while in the ditransitive construction in (b) the R (dunmarutha ‘to
(her) spouse’) is marked in the verbal dative case and the T (ngukuwuru ‘water’) is
marked in the proprietive case. All three arguments are thus encoded differently.
The fifth logical possibility, where the R and the T of the ditransitive clause are
encoded the same way but the P of the monotransitive clause is encoded differently,
has so far not been reported (Malchukov et al. 2010a).
The smallest group in Haspelmath’s (2011a) sample consists of 40 languages
(10.6%) that have a mixed system, such as English. Consider, for example, the sen-
tences John gave a book to Mary and John gave Mary a book. In the former sentence
there is a formal distinction between the R (to Mary) and the T (book), where in the
latter there is not (Mary and book respectively). This strategy is usually called dative
shift (see further 9.2.3.2 below).
9.1.3.5	 Verb agreement
Reference to the participants in a clause may also be coded on the verb. Many lan-
guages have various morphological ways of marking participant reference on the verb,
verb agreement (sometimes also verb coding or (verb) concord). What makes this a
case of agreement is that the form of the marking (whether an affix or a stem change)
is chosen paradigmatically according to the semantic properties of the participant
referred to. While English has very little morphological marking, the verb be changes
form according to the number and person properties of the participant referred to.
Thus a first person singular participant reference requires the form am (I am), while
a first person plural participant reference requires the form are (we are), and so on.
Similarly, one of the few morphological markings in English is the present tense suffix
â•‚s, which is required if the S/A (‘subject’) argument is in third person singular, as in
The girl sees a flower. If the S/A changes to the plural, the verb loses the suffix, as in The
girls see a flower (but not *The girls sees a flower).
Languages differ in whether or not they allow verb agreement to be the only refer-
ence to a participant in a clause. In English, for example, a free-form reference to the
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 247
argument is obligatory. A sentence like *am is not possible, even though the form of
the verb clearly indicates that the participant referred to is the first person singular.
This is sometimes called grammatical agreement as opposed to anaphoric agree-
ment, where the verbal reference to a participant is the only needed reference to the
argument in question. In Italian, for example, the word parlo ‘I speak’ forms a per-
fectly grammatical sentence. The verb ending â•‚o indicates that the participant referred
to is in the first person singular and the free form io ‘I’ is not obligatory. Languages
that allow anaphoric agreement are sometimes called pro-drop languages, while lan-
guages that do not allow anaphoric agreement are sometimes called lexical argument
languages. It is much more common to not require a subject pronoun for a clause (i.e.
to allow ‘pro-drop’). In Dryer’s (2011c) sample of 711 languages, 437 (61.5%) languages,
spread all over the world, have anaphoric agreement, as is the case in Italian, while
only 82 (or 11.5%), found especially in Europe and West Africa, require the pronomi-
nal subject to be present, as is the case in English. Even if we add Dryer’s fourth value,
which indicates the 67 (9.4%) languages where “pronominal subjects are expressed by
subject pronouns that occur in a different syntactic position from full noun phrase
subjects” (Dryer 2011c), we get 149 languages (21%), which is still a minority. However,
it makes sense to differentiate between the two values, since included in this latter
value are languages where the subject pronoun is a portmanteau for both pronominal
and TMA values. This latter value also includes languages where the subject pronoun
is obligatory even if a full noun phrase is expressed in the clause. In both these cases
one could argue that the pronouns in question are fulfilling similar tasks as verbal
affixes, even though they are phonologically free words, and that as such they could
be argued to belong to the verbal complex in the same way as verbal affixes do. An
example of a language where this is particularly evident is Bali-Vitu, where a preverbal
particle expresses both TMA values and person values.
		 Bali-Vitu (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
	 (166)	 e	 Lingei	 te	 vigi-ho	 na	 kalabaka
		 art	 PN	 real.3	hit-2sg	 prep	 stick
		 ‘Lingei hit you (sg) with a stick.’  (Ross 2002a:â•›374)
In (166) the preverbal particle te is a portmanteau for realis mood and third person,
and it is obligatory even though the full noun phrase (Lingei) is present. Languages
of this kind are predominantly found in sub-Saharan Africa and the western Pacific.
In 32 languages (4.5%) in Dryer’s sample the pronominal subject is expressed by
a clitic which can have variable hosts while in 61 languages (8.6%) the presence of the
subject pronoun is optional. Chemehuevi is an example of a language with subject pro-
noun clitics, where the pronominal subject attaches to the first word of the clause un-
less the clause contains a demonstrative, in which case it attaches to the demonstrative.
248	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Chemehuevi (Uto-Aztecan (Numic): USA)
	 (167)	 a.	 wahaku-a-n	 totoci-vɨ	 punikai-vɨ
			 two-obl-1sg	 head-pl(obl)	 see-past
			 ‘I saw two heads.’
		 b.	 aipaci	 aŋa-ja-n	 kwipa-vɨ
			 boy.obl	 that-obl-1sg	 hit-past
			 ‘I hit that boy.’  (Press 1975:â•›109,â•›186)
In (167a) the first person singular marker â•‚n attaches to the first word in the sentence,
the numeral wahakuâ•‚ ‘two’, while in (167b) it attaches to the demonstrative aŋaâ•‚ ‘that’.
Recall that a clitic is a phonetically bound unit that is not constrained by the syntax
of its host. Languages with subject pronoun clitics are predominantly found in North
America and Australia. An example of a language where the pronoun subject is op-
tional in the clause is Chantyal, where overt marking of the participant is not neces-
sary if it is otherwise clear from the context.
		 Chantyal (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): Nepal)
	 (168)	 mÇšnchi-sÇš	 thar-ra	 bÇšnnu	 lɦi-si-rÇš	 sar-ji	 chala	
		 person-erg	 mountain.goat-dat	 gun	 hit-ant-seq	 kill-pfv	 skin

		 ‘The man shot a mountain goat and killed it. He skinned it, cleaned it, took it
home, put it in a pot, cooked it and ate it.’  (Noonan 2003:â•›334)
In (168) there is no overt subject pronoun nor is there any verb affix referring to any of
the arguments; once the participants have been introduced (the man and the moun-
tain goat), there is no need to repeat any reference to them, since it is clear from the
contexts who is doing what to whom. Compare that to the English translation, where
the pronouns are obligatory (he, the subject, is used once and it, the object, is repeated
seven times). Languages where the subject pronoun is optional are predominantly
found in East and Southeast Asia as well as Australia.
The remaining 32 languages (4.5%) in Dryer’s sample have a mixed system where
presence or absence of the pronominal subject in the clause is either dependent on
various factors such as person, animacy, transitivity, and so on, or where more than
one of the above-mentioned the strategies are allowed.
The figures for the WALS sample are only minimally affected by the subtraction
of the two contact languages in Dryer’s (2011c) sample: Ndyuka, which is coded as
having obligatory pronouns in subject position, and Sango, which is coded as hav-
ing anaphoric agreement (the latter differs from the APiCS coding; see below). The
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 249
pattern for whether or not the subject pronoun is obligatory differs radically in the
APiCS sample, as shown in Table 9.2.
Table 9.2â•‡ Comparison between WALS and APiCS languages for expression
of pronominal subject. Adapted from Dryer (2011c) and Michaelis et al. (2013: feature 62).

This means that while non-creoles are much more likely to express the pronominal
subject through verbal affixes, pidgins and creoles seem much more likely to have ob-
ligatorily expressed subject pronouns (i.e. they do not seem likely to allow ‘pro-drop’).
Languages also differ in how many and which arguments are marked on the verb.
Those of us mostly used to Western European languages might assume that verbal af-
fixes only say anything about the ‘subject’, the A argument in transitive clauses. How-
ever, it is actually much more common to mark both the A and the P of transitive
clauses on the verb. In Siewierska’s (2011d) sample of 378 languages, only 73 (or 19.3%)
restrict their marking to the A only, as is the case in English. This is particularly com-
mon in Eurasia and eastern Africa but is not found at all in the Australian languages
of the sample. 193 languages (51.1%), however, mark both the A and P on the verb. This
is a very common strategy in all areas of the world except Eurasia and is particularly
dominant in North America, New Guinea and Australia. An example of a language
that marks both the A and the P is Palauan:
		 Palauan (Austronesian (Palauan): Palau)
	 (169)	 te-‘illebed-ii	 a	 bilis	 a	 rengalek
		 3pl(A)-hit-3sg(P)	 art	 dog	 art	 children
		 ‘The children hit the dog.’  (Georgopoulos 1991:â•›30)
151.â•‡ The languages for value 2 are Lingala, Ma’a/Mbugu (Mixed language (Bantu, Cushitic): Tan-
zania), Media Lengua and Michif; the languages for value 4 are Eskimo Pidgin and Papiamentu
(Creole (Spanish-lexified): Netherlands Antilles); the languages for value 6 are Bislama (Creole
(English-lexified): Vanuatu), Réunion Creole (Creole (French-lexified): Réunion) and Singapore
Bazaar Malay. In APiCS Sango is coded as having optional subject pronouns.
250	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (169) the prefix teâ•‚ indicates that the ‘subject’ (A) is a third person plural (namely
rengalek ‘the children’), while the suffix â•‚ii indicates that the ‘object’ (P) is a third per-
son singular (namely bilis ‘dog’). Much less common is to mark only the P on the verb.
This is found in only 24 (6.3%) languages in Siewierska’s sample, mainly in Africa and
South America. Kisi is an example of such a language:
		 Kisi (Niger-Congo (Southern Atlantic): Guinea)
	 (170)	 í	 sílá-ŋ	 lé
		 1sg	 advise-3sg	 neg
		 ‘I didn’t advise him.’  (Childs 1995:â•›72)
In (170) the verbal suffix â•‚ŋ denotes the P, while the A (í ‘I’) appears as a free form.
A very rare strategy indeed is to mark either the A or the P, but never both at the
same time. This is found only in six languages (1.6% of the sample), three of which –
Awa Pit (Barbacoan (Barbacoan): Colombia), Iquito (Zaparoan (Zaparoan): Peru)
and Tiriyo (Example (171)) – are located in northern South America, while the others
are scattered, with Kiowa (Kiowa Tanoan (Kiowa Tanoan): USA) in North America,
Kalkatungu (Australian (Pama-Nyungan)) in Australia and Chepang (Sino-Tibetan
(Bodic): Nepal) in South Asia.
		 Tiriyo (Cariban (Cariban): Suriname)
	 (171)	 a.	 manko	 j-ennoo-ne	 makapa-pona
			 1:mother	 1P-send-past.pfv	 Macapá-dirc

		 b.	 ji-nmuku	 wi-po-ka-e
			 1-son	 1A-clothes-priv.vzr:pres.ipfv-cty
			 ‘I am undressing my son.’  (Meira 1999:â•›263,â•›270)
In Tiriyo the verb may only index for one argument, the choice of which is based on
person ranking. Thus if one argument is either first or second person (1/2) and the
other argument is third person (3), the 1/2 person is indexed on the verb irrespective
of whether it constitutes an A or a P, as shown in Example (171). In the first sentence
the P (jâ•‚ ‘I’) is indexed, since it refers to the first person, while the A (manko ‘my.
mother’) is the third person. In the second sentence the A is indexed, because this
time the A is the first person (wiâ•‚ ‘I’) while the P is the third (nmuku ‘son’). If both
arguments are either the first and/or the second person the “speech act participants
only”152 prefix (k-/kï-) is used and if both participants are the third person the “non-
speech act participants” prefix (n-/ni-/nï-) is used:
152.â•‡ Speech act participants (SAP) means the first or second persons, i.e. the speaker(s) or
addressee(s).

Roughly one fifth (82 languages or 21.7%) of Siewierska’s (2011d) sample lack verbal
person marking altogether, mainly found in West Africa, the Caucasus and South and
Southeast Asia. Babungo, for example, lacks verbal person marking.

		 1sg	 hold.pres	 child

Languages also differ with respect to the alignment of their verbal marking. Siewierska
(2011a) mapped 380 languages for their verbal person marking alignment. In contrast
to noun phrases and pronouns, where the most common system is a neutral one (cf.
Comrie 2011a and 2011b as well as the previous section), this is found only for about
a fifth (84 languages or 22.1%) of Siewierska’s sample for verbal person marking, cor-
responding to those languages that do not have verbal person marking (and conse-
quently found in the same areas, see above). Instead, the most common system is the
accusative alignment, found in 212 languages (55.8%) spread over all areas of the world.
Pipil is an example of a language with accusative verb person marking alignment:
		 Pipil (Uto-Aztecan (Aztecan): El Salvador)
	 (174)	 a.	 ni-panu
			 1sg-pass
			 ‘I pass/cross.’
		 b.	 ti-panu
			 2sg-pass
			 ‘You pass/cross.’
		 c.	 ni-mits-ita-k
			 1sg-2sg-see-past
			 ‘I saw you.’
		 d.	 ti-nech-ita-k
			 2sg-1sg-see-past
			 ‘You saw me.’  (Campbell 1985:â•›68)
In (174) the S of the intransitive clauses (niâ•‚ ‘I’, tiâ•‚ ‘you’) are marked in the same way
as the A in the transitive clauses (niâ•‚ ‘I’, tiâ•‚ ‘you’), while the P are marked differently
(â•‚mitsâ•‚ ‘you’, â•‚nechâ•‚ ‘me’).
252	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
All other systems are comparatively rare in Siewierska’s sample. The ergative sys-
tem is found only in 19 languages (5%), mainly in South America and Southeast Asia.
An example of a language with ergative verbal person marking alignment is Tzutujil:
		 Tzutujil (Mayan (Mayan): Guatemala)
	 (175)	 a.	 x-in-war-i
			 compl-1sg.abs-sleep-IV.phrf
			 ‘I slept.’
		 b.	 x-at-war-i
			 compl-2sg.abs-sleep-IV.phrf
			 ‘You slept.’
		 c.	 x-in-aa-choy
			 compl-1sg.abs-2sg.erg-hit
			 ‘You cut me.’
		 d.	 x-at-nuu-ch’ey
			 compl-2sg.abs-1sg.erg-hit
			 ‘I cut you.’  (Dayley 1981:â•›85,â•›88)
In (175) the S (â•‚inâ•‚ ‘I’ and â•‚atâ•‚ ‘you’) look the same as the P (â•‚inâ•‚ ‘me’ and â•‚atâ•‚ ‘you’)
while the A look different (â•‚nuuâ•‚ ‘I’ and â•‚aaâ•‚ ‘you’).
Slightly more common than the ergative system is the so-called active system
of verbal person marking alignment, found in 26 languages (6.8%) in Siewierska’s
sample. Here S aligns with either A or P depending on various semantic or prag-
matic factors. In Yagua, for example, the S may look like the P in various discourse
contexts.
		 Yagua (Peba-Yaguan (Peba-Yaguan): Peru)
	 (176)	 a.	 sa-jú̜ú̜y	 Anita
			 3sg-fall	 PN
			 ‘Anita falls.’
		 b.	 sa-suuta	 Rospita	 raruvá̜á̜va-níí
			 3sg-wash	 PN	 down.river-3sg
			 ‘Rospita washes him/her downriver.’
		 c.	 múúy	 jú̜ú̜-níí	 munuñúmiy
			 there	 fall-3sg	 savage
			 ‘There falls the savage.’  (Payne 1985a:â•›45,â•›47,â•›57)
The S in Example (176a) looks like the A in (176b) (saâ•‚ ‘3sg’), while in (176c) the S
looks like the P in (176b) (â•‚níí ‘3sg’). A few languages, 11 (2.9%) in Siewierska’s sample,
arrange the alignment according to a referent hierarchy and usually the argument
with the higher ranking gets the special treatment.
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 253
The tripartite system is very rare indeed and is not included in the map. An ex-
ample of a language with the tripartite system for the second person singular as well
as the first person singular and plural is Yukulta.

In (177) each of the verbal person markings for the S (â•‚kaâ•‚ ‘I’), A (â•‚ŋaâ•‚ ‘I’) and P (â•‚nki
‘me’) arguments look different. Languages may also have more than one type of sys-
tem, split systems, found in 28 languages (7.4%) of Siewierska’s sample.
9.1.3.6	 Split systems
Languages tend to group together items with similar roles, so that those elements
that have similar kinds of functions also end up looking formally similar (this is what
Haiman 1980b calls isomorphism). Thus there are probably functional motivations
for grouping S, A and P in various ways. What ties S and A together, functionally, are
the semantic roles of agent and the pragmatic roles of topic. For example, in Mary
(S) ran ahead and Mary (A) batted the ball, both the S and A are the agents and topics
of the clause. What ties S and P together, on the other hand, are the semantic notions
of change of state and the pragmatic roles of focus. For example, in The lake (S)
froze and Mary opened the envelope (P), both S and P undergo a change of state and
constitute the focus of the clause. In languages with split systems, the motivation for
grouping S with either A or P lies with various semantic and pragmatic factors. For
instance, languages may have various alignments depending on the semantic and/or
pragmatic properties of the intransitive clause (split intransitivity) while others may
have various alignments depending on the semantic and/or pragmatic properties of
the transitive clause and more specifically the semantic and pragmatic roles that the
arguments get in the clause (split ergativity).
With split intransitivity the S is marked differently depending on the semantic
role it has. If it is essentially an agent-like role, the S will be marked as an A of a transi-
tive clause, showing accusative alignment. If, however, the S has an essentially patient-
like role, it will be marked as the P of a transitive clause, showing ergative alignment.
254	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
The two types of S arguments may be termed SA (for the type that aligns with the A
of a transitive clause; SA arguments are sometimes called ‘actors’) and SP (for the type
that aligns with the P of a transitive clause; SP arguments are sometimes called ‘un-
dergoers’). The semantic role of S may be determined by the semantic properties of
the verb; for instance, that dynamic verbs take an SA while stative verbs take an SP. Or
the S may be split along the lines of volition, where SA is used when the argument is
volitional and SP when the argument is not. Verbs that specifically take SA arguments
are sometimes called ‘unergative’ verbs while verbs that specifically take SP arguments
are sometimes called ‘unaccusative’ verbs. Chochtaw is an example of a language with
split intransitivity, where dynamic verbs take ‘actor’ S arguments (SA) while stative
verbs take ‘undergoer’ S arguments (SP).

In Example (178a) the intransitive clause contains a dynamic verb with a volitional
argument and the S takes the same form as in the A in the transitive clause in (178c)
(â•‚liâ•‚ ‘I’). Here the S and A have in common that they are both actors in the clause.
In the intransitive clause containing a stative verb with a nonvolitional argument
(b), the S takes the same form as the P in the transitive clause in (178d) (â•‚saâ•‚ ‘I,
me’). Here the S and P have in common that they are both undergoers in the clause.
In (178e) the same person is once an undergoer (SP) and once an actor (SA). In
Eastern Pomo (Hokan (Pomoan): USA) the semantic feature of volition is particu-
larly dominant in governing the choice of the alignment. The SA is used when the
Â�
intransitive argument is volitional, while the SP is used when it is nonvolitional. This
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 255
works both ways: with some verbs either SA or SP can be used, affecting the meaning
of the whole clause.
		 Eastern Pomo (Hokan (Pomoan): USA)
	 (179)	 a.	 há	 mi·pal	 šá·k’a
			 1sg.A	 3sg.O	 killed

ʾe
ʾ·xélka
			 1sg.O(SP)	slide/slip
			 ‘I am slipping.’ (not on purpose)  (McLendon 1978:â•›1–3)
In Example (179) the intransitive takes an SA argument if the subject acts with voli-
tion, while it takes an SP argument if there is minimal or no volition in the act. Notice
that the verb in (179c and d) is the same, but gets different readings (‘sliding’ versus
‘slipping’) depending on the argument chosen, and the choice of the argument itself
depends on the presence or absence of volition with the subject.
foursome split
The Saibai dialect of Kalaw LagawYa (Australian (PamaÂ�
-Nyungan): Australia) has four different
alignments depending on the type of NP:
	 i.	 tripartite for singular pronouns
	 ii.	 neutral for plural pronouns
	 iii.	 accusative for proper names and kin terms
	 iv.	 ergative for common nouns (Comrie 1981a:â•›8ff)
Split intransitivity may be based on other criteria, such as animacy or pragmatic roles.
The Yagua Example (176) above, for instance, illustrates a split based on pragmatic
roles. The SA and the SP in the example are both nonvolitional arguments, but the SP
expresses a change of scene and is thus a focussed argument.
While split intransitivity is based on the semantics and/or pragmatics of the
intransitive clause, split ergativity is based on the semantics and/or pragmatics of
256	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the transitive clause.153 One determining factor of the split in alignment may be the
animacy of the arguments, especially the agent-like arguments. Thus it is often the
case that pronouns, which are higher up the animacy hierarchy (or empathy hierar-
chy, see, for example DeLancey 1981), have an accusative alignment, while all other
nominals have an ergative alignment. This is sometimes called agent-worthiness or
topic-worthiness (cf., for example, Payne 1997). In Kham, for instance, the speech act
participants (SAP) have an accusative alignment while all other nominals (i.e. those
ranking lower than the speaker and the addressee on the animacy hierarchy) have an
ergative alignment.
		 Kham (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): Nepal)

			 2sg-nom	 1sg-objv	2sg-see-1sg-pfv
			 ‘You saw me.’  (Watters 2002:â•›66–8)
In Example (180a, b and c) the S and the P are marked in the same way, with the ab-
solutive (â•‚Ø) case, while the A are marked with the ergative (â•‚(y)e) case. In (180d) the
A argument, an SAP, is marked with the nominative (â•‚Ø) case, while the P argument,
not an SAP, is marked with the absolutive (â•‚Ø) case. In (180e), however, where both
participants are SAPs, we see a classic accusative system, where the A is marked in the
nominative (â•‚Ø) case, while the P is marked in the ‘objective’ (â•‚lai) case.
153.â•‡ There is no particular reason why this should be called “split ergativity” and not, for example,
“split accusativity”. As Scott DeLancy says, “[i]t is very telling that we talk about ‘ergativity’ – and
have conferences and workshops on topics like ‘Ergativity in Amazonian Languages’ – but confer-
ences or thematic volumes devoted to ‘accusativity’ or ‘nominativity’ (which I think is the preferable
term) seem to be a less prominent feature of the linguistic landscape. (…) Our tradition inclines
us to think of ‘ergativity’ as some special deviation from the norm; in fact it is a non-category, it is
simply the absence of nominativity” (2006:â•›6). See also McGregor (2009).
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 257
Another determining factor of the split alignment may be the tense, mood or as-
pect of a clause. More often than not the tenses referring to the past and perfective or
completive aspects trigger an ergative alignment while nonpast tenses and imperfec-
tive aspects trigger an accusative alignment. Chol is an example of a language where
the accusative alignment is used only in imperative declarative sentences while all
others follow an ergative alignment.
		 Chol (Mayan (Mayan): Mexico)
	 (181)	 a.	 c̸a-h	 k’el-e-Ø
			 asp-1sg.A	 see-pfv-3sg.P
			 ‘I saw it.’ (perfective)
		 b.	 c̸a	 til-ig-on
			 asp	 come-pfv-1sg.SP
			 ‘I came.’ (perfective)
		 c.	 mi-h	 wahl-en-et
			 asp-1sg.A	 mock-ipfv-2sg.P
			 ‘I ridicule you.’ (imperfective)
		 d.	 mi-h	 suht-el
			 asp-1sg.SA	 return.ipfv
			 ‘I return.’ (imperfective)  (Quizar & Knowles-Berry 1988:â•›77–8)
In (181) the perfective sentences (a and b) display an ergative alignment, where the
single argument of the intransitive clause is expressed with the suffixes used for P
arguments in transitive clauses. In the imperfective sentences (c and d), however, the
single argument of the intransitive clause is expressed in the same way as A arguments
of transitive clauses.
9.2	 Valency
We have seen that verbs differ in how many (if any) objects they can take. Verbs also
differ in their valency, that is, in how many arguments they obligatorily have to take.154
The former, transitivity, overlaps a great deal with valency, but the two should not be
confused. A ditransitive verb, for example, takes two objects (direct and Â�
indirect),
154.â•‡ Strictly speaking there are two different notions, semantic valency, which refers to the amount
of necessary participants to a verb, and syntactic valency, which refers to the amount of arguments
that are present in the clause. While the semantic valency remains the same – put is always a triva-
lent verb (i.e. it has a valency of three) – the syntactic valency may vary depending on whether and
which valency-adjusting operations are used. See further below. For a thorough discussion on the
typology of valency, see Kulikov (2010).
258	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
as in John gave the book to Mary, where the book is the direct object and Mary is the
indirect object. But consider a verb like place, where somebody (subject) places some-
thing (object) somewhere, as in John placed the book on the table. Here we have only
one object (the book); on the table is not an indirect object. It is, however, a necessary
argument to the verb place. Sentences like *John placed the book, *Placed the book on
the table or *John placed on the table, where one of the arguments is missing, are not
acceptable. An example of a monovalent verb (i.e. a verb with a valency of one) is
dance, since only one participant is necessary to make the clause grammatical: Mary
danced. An example of a bivalent verb (a verb with a valency of two) is kill, since two
participants are necessary to make the clause grammatical: John killed the fly (but not
*John killed or *Killed the fly).
In English there is no such thing as an avalent verb (i.e. a verb with a valency of
zero, also called zero-intransitives or ambient clauses), so every clause needs a sub-
ject, even if it does not refer to any actual entity, a so-called dummy or expletive sub-
ject. An example of a dummy subject can be found in the sentence It is raining, where
It does not refer to any actual entity. Avalent verbs usually involve environmental
conditions, and are especially typical for weather conditions (cf. Dryer 2007a:â•›267ff).
In Italian, for example, there is no dummy subject.
		 Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italy)
	 (182)	 piove
		 rain.3sg.pres
		 ‘It is raining.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In (182) the verb is inflected for the third person singular, but there is no noun phrase
argument in the clause. Notice that avalent clauses are not the same as clauses with
‘pro-drop’, since with ‘pro-drop’ the pronoun may optionally be included or left out,
the choice hinging on various factors such as, for example, focus. A sentence like
lui parla ‘he speak.3sg.pres’ is as grammatical as parla ‘(he) speak.3sg.pres’. This is,
however, not possible with weather expressions: something like *lui piove is not ac-
ceptable.
Since having a dummy subject in weather expressions is the norm for German-
ic languages, which many of us are familiar with, especially English, it might come
as a surprise that this is, in fact, extremely rare cross-linguistically. In a genetically
balanced survey of 218 languages, I found that only six (2.8%) languages, including
English,155 had a dummy subject in weather expressions, as shown in Map 9.1 below.
155.â•‡ The other five languages are Comanche, Cuiba (Guahiban (Guahiban): Colombia), Car Nico-
barese (Austro-Asiatic (Nicobarese): Nicobar Islands), Tlingit (Na-Dene (Tlingit): USA) and Záparo
(Zaparoan (Zaparoan): Ecuador).
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 259
The most common strategy for expressing ‘it is raining’ (or some similar environ-
mental expression) is to have a referential subject, found in 128 languages (58.7%). An
example of a referential subject construction can be found in Mauwake, where the
clause contains both a full noun (‘rain’) and a verb (‘descend’):
		 Mauwake (Trans-New Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (183)	 ipia	 or-om-ik-eya
		 rain	 descend-SS.SIM-be-2/3sg.DS
		 ‘It was raining.’ / ‘It rained.’  (Berghäll 2010:â•›143,â•›237)
Avalent constructions, as in the Italian example above, are found in 78 languages
(35.8%). The remaining six languages156 (2.8%) have a noun used predicatively in the
clause, as in Kambera, where the noun ‘rain’ may be used to express ‘it is raining’ (or,
‘(There is) rain’).
		 Kambera (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia)
	 (184)	 urang
		 rain(noun)
		 ‘It is raining.’ / ‘(There is) rain.’  (Klamer 1998:â•›410)
As Map 9.1 below shows, there is some areal patterning to the strategies: while the
few languages with a dummy subject and with referential subjects are scattered
about, avalent clause strategies cluster in Southern and Eastern Europe, on the
Southeast Asian islands and in North and South America but are almost completely
absent in Africa, Mainland Asia and Meso-America, while the referential subject
strategy clusters in Africa, mainland Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea, as well
as Meso and South America, but is almost completely absent in insular Southeast
Asia and North America.
Whereas arguments are obligatory, adjuncts are not, but instead constitute op-
tional noun phrases included in a clause. An example of an adjunct can be found in
Mary danced on the street, where on the street is an adjunct (a non-obligatory noun
phrase); a sentence like Mary danced is perfectly acceptable without any further
specification.
All languages have various strategies for adjusting the valency of a clause. Valency
may be increased, decreased, or the roles of the arguments may be swapped. While
it is beyond the scope of this section to give an exhaustive list of the various valency
alternating strategies known across languages, some examples of the more commonly
discussed strategies will be mentioned below.
156.â•‡ These are: Aikanã, Nivkh (Isolate: Russia), Kambera, Kanoé (Kapixana (Kapixana): Brazil),
Pwo Karen (Sino-Tibetan (Karen): Myanmar) and Kuot (Isolate: Papua New Guinea).

9.2.1	 Increasing valency
Increasing the valency of the clause involves bringing in a new necessary participant
into the clause. Merely adding optional information, such as adjuncts, does not entail
valency increase. The crucial point is that with the valency increasing device the new
participant becomes an argument, an obligatory participant, without which the clause
would be ungrammatical.
9.2.1.1	 Causatives
Causative constructions essentially merge two separate events into one single com-
plex event which in turn increases the valency of the original event by one. For exam-
ple, in the clause Mary laughed we have one argument. A causative construction of the
basic event (Mary laughed) would be something like John made Mary laugh. Here two
separate events are merged into one: the causing event, where John (the causer) does
something, and the caused event, where Mary (the causee) does something (laughs)
because of John’s action. It is the notion of causation that demands an additional par-
ticipant: someone has to be the causer of the event (a sentence like *made Mary laugh
is not acceptable, for example). Causative constructions have been the focus of much
research and interest, and it is quite beyond the scope of this section to adequately
deal with the full complexity of the topic. For accessible discussions on causatives,
see Comrie (1989:â•›165ff) and Dixon (2000). A very thorough discussion indeed on
causatives is Song (1996).
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 261
Causatives are commonly divided into three different types, lexical, morphologi-
cal and analytic causatives. In lexical causatives the semantics of the verb itself con-
tains a notion of causation. Compare the difference between die and kill, where the
former does not contain any notion of causation (John died does not imply any other
actor in the event) but the latter does (in Peter killed John we may assume that Peter
caused John to die). It is extremely common, if not universal, for languages to have at
least some lexical causatives. In morphological causatives a morphological process is
applied to the base verb in order to get the notion of causation. Very often the mor-
phological process involves affixation, but it may also involve other morphological
processes that the language makes use of, for example various non-linear markers
such as tone, ablaut or the root-and-pattern. Turkish is an example of a language with
morphological causative constructions.
		 Turkish (Altaic (Turkic): Turkey)
	 (185)	 a.	 Hasan	 koş-tu
			 PN		 run-past
			 ‘Hasan ran.’
		 b.	 (ben)	 Hasan-ı	 koş-tur-du-m
			 1sg		 PN-acc	 run-caus-past-1sg
			 ‘I made Hasan run.’
		 c.	 Hasan	 kitab-ı	 oku-du
			 PN		 book-acc	 read-past
			 ‘Hasan read the book.’
		 d.	 (ben)	 Hasan-a	 kitab-ı	 oku-t-tu-m
			 1sg		 PN-dat	 book-acc	 read-caus-past-1sg
			 ‘I made Hasan read the book.’  (Kornfilt 2003:â•›331)
In (185) the intransitive clause Hasan ran (a) is changed into a transitive clause I made
Hasan run (b) by means of the causative suffix â•‚tur. Notice that Hasan goes from
subject to direct object, which seems straightforward enough, since the causer must
be the subject, which makes the causee an object. In (185d), however, where the transi-
tive clause of (185c) has been made ditransitive, Hasan goes from subject to indirect
object, which might seem counter-intuitive. Here we have an instance of what may be
termed a ‘causee accessibility hierarchy’ of subject > direct object > indirect object >
oblique (Comrie 1989:â•›176), where the causee (in this case Hasan) moves to the high-
est available slot in the causative clause (i.e. the left-most available slot). The slot of
subject will be taken by the causer (in this case ‘I’) and since the direct object slot is
already taken (in this case by ‘the book’), Hasan moves to the next available slot, that
of the indirect object.
262	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
An analytic causative is one where a separate verb is used to get the notion of
causation, as in English to make someone do something.157
The difference between these three types of causatives is not merely in form, but
also in concept. A lexical causative expresses a more direct causation, or a tighter link
between cause and event, than an analytic causative. Compare the difference between
the following sentences: John killed the dog versus John caused the dog to die. In the
former sentence we may assume that John was directly responsible for the death of
the dog. In the latter, however, John is further removed from the event of the dog’s
death and it might not necessarily be intentional. For instance, John might inadver-
tently have given the dog something to eat which it was highly allergic to. Or John
might have used a fertilizer for his flowerbeds that happened to smell so incitingly
that the dog ate some and was poisoned by it. In the former case we have an instance
of direct causation, while in the latter we have an instance of indirect causation.
Haiman (1983) proposed that the form of the expression and the directness correlate:
the longer the morphological form of the construction, the more indirect the causa-
tion, or conversely, the shorter the morphological form of the causative construction,
the more direct the causation. This would make lexical causatives express more direct
causation while analytic causatives would express more indirect causation, and mor-
phological causatives would come somewhere in between.
The above also implies varying degrees of control over the caused events. Languag-
es may code the causee differently morphologically to differentiate between degrees
of control of the causee. For instance in English the nominative case is used when the
causee has a high degree of control, while the accusative is used when the causee has a
lower degree of control. Compare the sentences I asked that he leave with I asked him
to leave, where in the former the causee (he) has a right to say no (high degree of con-
trol), but in the latter the causee (him) is not likely to have the option of saying no (low
degree of control). The causee has no control at all in a sentence like I made him leave.
In Japanese this is expressed through different postpositions (case markers):
		 Japanese (Japanese (Japanese): Japan)
	 (186)	 a.	 Taroo	 ga	 ik-u
			 PN	 nom	 go-pres
			 ‘Taro goes.’
157.â•‡ I am in fact simplifying matters greatly here by including analytic causatives as a valency in-
creasing device. It is a matter of contention if a construction like the English to make someone do
something belongs to the nonperiphrastic causative type (where two events are merged into one
clause of a complex event) or to the periphrastic type (where the two events constitute two clauses).
For more details on periphrastic causatives and how they differ from nonperiphrastic ones, see, for
example, Song (1996, 2011a and 2011b) and the references therein.
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 263

			 PN	 nom	 PN	 ag	 go-caus-past
			 ‘Hanako had Taro go.’  (Shibatani 1990:â•›308f)
In (186a) we have an intransitive clause with only one argument. In (186b and c) the
clause is made transitive by way of the causative construction (the suffix â•‚se). The dif-
ference between (186b and c) is that in (186b) Taro, marked in the accusative case, has
minimal control (is not able to refuse to go), while in (186c) Taro, marked in the agen-
tive case, has more control (Taro may choose not to go). In (186c) Taro was persuaded
to go, while in (b) Taro was basically forced to go.
9.2.1.2	 Applicatives
An applicative construction increases the valency of a base clause by one by mak-
ing an optional argument (adjunct) into an obligatory argument (object) through a
marker on the base clause verb. The new object of the clause is called the applied
object. If the applicative is formed from a transitive base clause this means that the
base clause already has an object. This “original” object is called the basic object in
applicative constructions, to distinguish it from the new, applicative, object. For a very
thorough discussion on applicative constructions, see Peterson (2007). Tukang Besi is
an example of a language with applicative constructions:
		 Tukang Besi (Austronesian (Sulawesi): Indonesia)
	 (187)	 a.	 no-ala	 te	 kau
			 3.real-fetch	 the	 wood
			 ‘She fetched the wood.’
		 b.	 no-ala-ako	 te	 ina-su	 te	 kau
			 3.real-fetch-appl	the	 mother-my	 the	 wood
			 ‘She fetched the wood (as a favour) for my mother.’  (Donohue 1999:â•›256)
In (187a) we have an ordinary transitive, a two-place predicate, demanding two argu-
ments, the subject (indicated as a person affix noâ•‚ ‘s/he’ on the verb) and the direct
object (kau ‘wood’). With the applicative suffix â•‚ako in (187) we get a clause contain-
ing a three-place predicate, i.e. a verb demanding three arguments, the subject and
the direct object, both of which stay the same from the base clause, and the applied
object (in this case a benefactive), inasu ‘my.mother’. A sentence like *noalaako te kau
‘I fetch.applicative the wood’ would not be acceptable, as the necessary argument of
who I am fetching it for is missing.
264	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In her sample of 183 languages Polinsky (2011b) found 83 (45.4%) languages with
applicative constructions of varying kinds. Of these, the majority (74 languages or
40.4% of the entire sample) allow applicatives for both transitive and intransitive
clauses, while seven languages (3.8% of the entire sample) restrict applicative construc-
tions to transitive clauses, and only two languages (1.1% of the entire sample), Fijian
and Wambaya (Australian (West Barkly): Australia), restrict applicative constructions
to intransitive clauses. Furthermore, languages may differ in terms of which role gets
promoted to an applicative object. In the Tukang Besi example above it was the bene-
factive. In Yagua, however, the instrumental may be promoted.

In (188) the instrumental of sentence (a) becomes an obligatory argument of sentence
(b) because of the applicative suffix â•‚ta. Of the languages in Polinsky’s sample that
have applicative constructions, most (51 or 27.9% of the entire sample) allow applica-
tive objects for arguments with a benefactive role as well as arguments with other
semantic roles. A number of languages (36 or 19.7% of the entire sample) allow appli-
cative objects to be formed with benefactive roles only. The common semantic roles
for the applicative object are locatives (18 languages or 9.8% of the entire sample),
instruments (17 languages or 9.3% of the entire sample) or both locatives and instru-
ments (12 languages or 6.6% of the entire sample) (Polinsky 2011b). Applicatives tend
to be found in areas with languages with rich verbal morphology, such as sub-Saharan
Africa (especially the Bantu languages), Papua New Guinea and northern Australia,
as well as North and Meso-America. The Eurasian continent almost completely lacks
applicative constructions, except for a cluster in the Caucasus area, which also cor-
relates with languages that have rich verbal morphology.
9.2.2	 	 Reducing valency
Reducing the valency of a clause means employing devices that render an obligatory
participant optional. Crucially, the omission of one of the arguments from the base
clause in the valency reduced clause does not make the new (valency reduced) clause
ungrammatical.
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 265
9.2.2.1	 Passives
A passive construction reduces the number of arguments by demoting the subject
of the base clause, the active counterpart clause. The subject of the active counter-
part clause thus becomes either an optional participant (an adjunct) or is omitted
entirely. The sentence John hit the ball is an example of an active transitive clause
where John is the subject (or more exactly the A of the clause) and the ball is the
object (or more exactly the P of the clause). This clause can be made intransitive by
passivizing it to The ball was hit (by John), where the previously necessary argument
John is now only an optional argument and may be omitted. If a ditransitive clause is
passivized and loses one argument, it thus becomes a simple transitive clause (com-
pare I gave her a book with A book was given to her (by me)).158 Active and passive
constructions belong to the category of grammatical voice (or diathesis), which,
very simplified, basically announces the semantic role of the subject in the clause.
In the active voice the subject is the agent or actor, while in the passive the subject
is the patient, recipient or benefactive. For a thorough discussion on grammatical
voice in general, see Klaiman (1991). For thorough and accessible discussions on the
passive in particular, see, for example, Keenan & Dryer (2007) and the classic piece
of work by Siewierska (1984).
Typical features of the passive are, as hinted above, that it has an active counter-
part and that the subject of the active counterpart is rendered non-obligatory or even
omitted completely in the passive counterpart clause. Another typical feature of the
passive is that its subject corresponds to the direct object of the active counterpart.
Yet another typical feature of the passive is that it tends to be used as a foregrounding
device: in the sentences John hit the ball and I gave her a book the direct objects are not
the topics of the clauses. With passivization the direct objects get topicalized: in The
ball was hit and A book was given to her the direct objects of the active counterparts
have become the topics of the passive clauses.
Passives may be expressed either morphologically (synthetically) or analytically
(periphrastically). English is an example of a language with an analytic passive, where
the active verb is passivized through the construction auxiliary + verb.participle, as in
be + vb-en (e.g. was given). Mualang is an example of a language with a morphologi-
cal passive, where voice is marked by affixation on the verb.
158.â•‡ The agent of the clause may thus optionally be either overt or covert: in The ball was hit by John
and The book was given to her by me the agents (John and me respectively) are overt. In The ball was
hit or The book was given to her, the agent is covert but is implied – even if the agent of the action is
supressed there is still an implication that the ball was hit by someone and that the book was given
by someone.
266	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Mualang (Austronesian (Malayic): Indonesia)
	 (189)	 a.	 urang	 N-curi	 manuk	 ku
			 person	 act-steal	 chicken	 1sg
			 ‘Somebody stole my chicken.’
		 b.	 manuk	 ku	 da-curi
			 chicken	 1sg	 pass-steal
			 ‘My chicken was stolen.’  (Tjia 2007:â•›151)
In (189) the verb of the active clause in (a) has been passivized in (b) by the passive
prefix daâ•‚. Notice also that the subject (urang ‘somebody’) in the active clause (a)
has been demoted and omitted, while the object (manuk ‘chicken’) of (a) has been
promoted to the subject of the passive clause in (b). The two arguments of the active
clause have thus been reduced to one argument in the passive clause.
The kinds of passives discussed so far typically involve the demotion of the most
agent-like argument and the promotion of the most patient-like argument of the
clause. The resulting passive thus has an overt lexical subject (the promoted patient-
like argument). These kinds of passives are called personal passives. In the kinds of
passives that only involve the demotion of the agent-like argument, but not the pro-
motion of the patient-like argument, the overt lexical subject is lacking. These kinds
of passives are called impersonal passives. An example of an impersonal passive,
where there is no lexical subject, can be found in German:
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (190)	 Hier	 wird	 ge-tanz-t
		 here	 be	 ptcp-dance-ptcp
		 ‘Dancing takes place here.’ (lit. ‘here is danced’)  (source: personal knowledge)
In (190) there is no lexical subject, but only the passive form of the verb tanzen ‘to dance’.
It is somewhat more common cross-linguistically for languages to lack passives than
to have them. In her sample of 373 languages Siewierska (2011c) found that 162 languages
(43.4%) have passives while 211 (56.6%) lack them. Passives are very common in Eurasia,
Eastern Africa, Eastern North America and northern South America while they are
relatively uncommon in coastal West Africa, Southeast Asia and northern Australia,
Meso-America and eastern North America. The figures change insignificantly once the
contact languages Ndyuka and Sango (both lacking passives) have been subtracted from
Siewierska’s sample. The pattern differs in APiCS, where only 23 languages (20.3%) lack
the passive altogether (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 90). It thus seems that pidgin and
creole languages are more likely to have passives than non-creoles.
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 267
9.2.2.2	 Antipassives
The term antipassive was coined by Silverstein (1972:â•›395) to capture the fact that the
construction is basically a mirror image of the passive. Just as with passives the an-
tipassive construction makes one of the two necessary arguments of the base clause
optional. However, while in passives the agent-like argument of the active clause gets
demoted and the patient-like argument of the clause gets promoted, in antipassives
it is the patient-like argument that gets demoted while the agent-like argument stays.
The crucial thing for both passives and antipassives is that valency is reduced. Thus
a two-place verb like throw, which normally requires two arguments (the entity that
does the throwing and the entity that gets thrown), only requires one argument if it
gets passivized (as in The ball was thrown). Likewise, with antipassives, a two-place
verb can be modified through antipassivization to require only one argument. The
difference between the two constructions lies in which argument it is that stays and
which argument it is that becomes optional or even suppressed. As with passives, the
reason for using an antipassive construction very often lies in pragmatic factors of fo-
cus and topicalization, as one participant is downplayed and the other is highlighted.
Consider the following example:
		 Chukchi (Chukotko-Kamchatkan (Northern Chukotko-Kamchatkan): Russia)
	 (191)	 a.	 ʔaaček-a	 kimiʔ-ən	 ne-nlʔetet-ən
			 youth-erg	 load-abs	 3pl.subj-carry-aor.3sg.obj
			 ‘(The) young men carried away the/a load.’
		 b.	 ʔaaček-ət	 ine-nlʔetet-gʔə-t	 kimitʔ-e
			 youth-abs	 antip-carry-aor.3sg.subj-pl	 load-instr
			 ‘(The) young men carried away the/a load.’  (Kozinsky et al. 1988:â•›652)
In (191a) we have a transitive clause and the two-place verb is marked for both argu-
ments, with neâ•‚ indexing the A (ʔaačeka ‘youth.ergative’) and the portmanteau â•‚ən
signalling the aorist as well as indexing the P (kimiʔən ‘load.absolutive’). In (191b)
the clause only has one argument, as the antipassive form of the verb shows by being
indexed only for the single argument of the clause (ʔaačekət ‘youth.absolutive’) with
the portmanteau suffix â•‚gʔə and the plural suffix â•‚t. The participant that was originally
the patient-like argument has now become an adjunct, as is also signalled by the in-
strumental case marking (â•‚e). Very often antipassives generalize the meaning of the
patient-like argument of the base clause. Thus what in (191a) might refer to specific
loads, may in (191b) have been “de-individualized” (they have become semantically
generic) into loads in general. A possible way of trying to capture the difference in
English could be to translate (191b) as ‘The young men went load-carrying’, or ‘The
young men engaged in load-carrying’, where no specific loads are referred to.
268	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Antipassives are much less common cross-linguistically than passives. In
Â�
Polinsky’s (2011a) sample of 194 languages, only 48 (24.7%) have antipassives while
146 (75.3%) lack them. Languages with antipassive constructions cluster mainly in
the Caucasus, in northern Australia and in North America. It is often assumed that
antipassives correlate with ergative alignment, but while there are more ergative
languages than accusative ones with antipassives in Polinsky’s sample there is “no
principled correlation between ergativity and the antipassive” (2011a). Notice also
that passives and antipassives are not mutually exclusive. For example, thirteen lan-
guages are listed in the WALS database as having both passive and antipassive con-
structions.159
9.2.2.3â•‡ Noun incorporation
Noun incorporation was discussed in 6.1.2. What it essentially means in terms of va-
lency is that one of the arguments, typically the object, gets incorporated into the
verb stem, thus creating a one-argument clause. An example of this can be found in
Yucatec (52), repeated here for convenience:
		 Yucatec (Mayan (Mayan): Mexico)
	 a.	 t-in-p’oʔ-Ø-ah	 nòok
		 compl-1sg-wash-it-perf	 clothes
		 ‘I washed (the) clothes.’
	 b.	 p’oʔ-nòok-n-ah-en
		 wash-clothes-antipass-pfv-1sg.abs
		 ‘I clothes-washed.’ (= ‘I washed clothes.’) (Bricker 1978:â•›15)
In (a) the noun nòok ‘clothes’ stands alone as an object to the verb p’oʔ ‘wash’. Notice
that the verb is not only inflected for the agent-like argument (â•‚inâ•‚ ‘1sg’), but also for
the patient-like argument of the clause (â•‚Øâ•‚ ‘it’). In (b) the noun has been incorporat-
ed into the verb; notice that the verb now only carries an inflection for one argument
(â•‚en ‘1sg.absolutive’). The clause has thus been detransitivized and now only demands
one argument. A possible way of trying to capture the decrease in valency is in the
English translation ‘I clothes-washed’.
159.â•‡ These are Basque, Koyraboro Senni (Nilo-Saharan (Songhay): Mali), Krongo, Päri, Chamorro,
Yukulta, Upriver Halkomelem (Salishan (Central Salish): Canada), Nez Perce, Comanche, West
Greenlandic, Jakaltek (Mayan (Mayan): Guatemala), Tzutujil and Sanuma (Yanomam (Yanomam):
Venezuela).
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 269
valency increasing incorporation
Nadëb (Nadahup (Nadahup): Brazil) allows postposition incorporation (see also Example (54)
above) which transitivizes an intransitive verb, promoting the argument of the postposition
to an object and making the original subject of the intransitive verb an agent. Postposition
incorporation is also possible for transitive verbs in Makú, in which case again the argument
of the postposition is promoted to an object, and the original object gets delegated to the
periphery (Martins & Martins 1999:â•›262).
9.2.2.4â•‡ Anticausatives
Anticausatives, also called middles or mediopassives, are the logical opposites of
causatives. With causative constructions we have a non-causative verb and add an
element to make it causative, thereby increasing the valency by one. With anticaus-
atives it is exactly the opposite: we start with a causative base and add an element to
take out the sense of causation, thereby reducing the valency by one (the causer is
no longer needed). The reason for the term ‘middle’ for anticausatives is because the
constructions are neither passive nor active; in active clauses we have the agent do-
ing something to the patient. In passive clauses we have something happening to the
patient but the identity of the agent is downplayed. In middles, on the other hand, the
role of the agent is completely ignored, and the situation is treated more like a process.
With passives we have a covert agent: in The ball was thrown there is an implication
that someone threw the ball. Thus a sentence like The ball was deliberately thrown is
acceptable, since even if the identity of the agent is only optional or even suppressed,
we may still assume that there is an agent involved. In other words, the clause is se-
mantically transitive even if its valency has been reduced syntactically. With anticaus-
atives (or middles), however, there is no implied agent for the situation. Compare the
following sentences:
	 (192)	 a.	 The man broke the vase.
		 b.	 The vase broke.
In (192a) we have an active transitive clause; the passive equivalent is The vase was
broken (by the man). Sentences like The man deliberately broke the vase and The vase
was deliberately broken (by the man) are quite acceptable. In (192b), however, we have
an example of an anticausative (or middle), where no agent is implied – something
like *The vase broke (by the man) is not possible. Furthermore, the lack of the implied
agent precludes any sense of volition: something like *The vase broke deliberately is
not acceptable.
English does not have any morphological marking for the anticausative (or mid-
dle) voice, but many languages do. Yagua is an example of such a language:
270	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Yagua (Peba-Yaguan (Peba-Yaguan): Peru)
	 (193)	 a.	 sa-nóóta-máá-rà
			 3sg-knock.down-perf-inan
			 ‘S/he has knocked it down.’
		 b.	 sa-nóóta-y-máá
			 3sg-knock.down-anticaus-perf
			 ‘S/he has fallen down.’  (Payne 1985a:â•›62f)
In (193a) we have an active transitive clause, as indicated by the verbal prefix saâ•‚ refer-
ring to the agent-like argument ‘s/he’ as well as the verbal suffix â•‚rà referring to the
inanimate patient-like argument ‘it’. In (193b), however, the anticausative suffix â•‚y not
only takes out one argument (there is no P anymore), but also takes out the sense of
causation, which can only be captured in English by changing the verb in the transla-
tion from ‘knock down’ to ‘fall down’. Notice that the Yagua base verb nóóta ‘knock.
down’ has not been replaced by any new verb, but merely been modified by the anti-
causative suffix â•‚y.
9.2.3	 	 Transposing valency
With valency transposing devices the number of arguments of a clause is not changed,
but the roles between them is somehow altered. This means that the verb still requires
the same number of arguments as in the base clause to make the clause grammatical.
It is simply that their respective semantic roles get swapped. As with valency reducing
or increasing devices, the main motivation for these operations are such pragmatic
factors as topic and focus, and so on.
9.2.3.1	 Inversion
With inversion the alignment between the arguments in the base (or direct) clause
has been exchanged (or inverted). Consider the two sentences from Nocte:
		 Nocte (Sino-Tibetan (Northern Naga): India)
	 (194)	 a.	 nga-ma	 ate	 hetho-ang
			 I-erg	 he	 teach-1sg
			 ‘I will teach him.’
		 b.	 ate-ma	 nga-nang	 hetho-h-ang
			 he-erg	 I-acc	 teach-inv-1sg
			 ‘He will teach me.’  (DeLancey 1981:â•›641 citing Das Gupta 1971)
The verbal ending agrees with whichever argument is higher on the animacy hier-
archy, in this case the first person. The default is that whichever argument that is
higher on the animacy hierarchy is interpreted as the subject of the clause, i.e. the
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 271
first person in (194a). With the inverse marker â•‚h this is switched so that the subject
is interpreted to be whichever argument is lower on the animacy hierarchy, in this
case the third person. Notice that the verbal ending still agrees with the first person,
which is now the P of the clause (nganang ‘I.accusative’). This is also supported by
the ergative case marking â•‚ma, which appears on the first person in (194a) but on
the third person in (b). The purpose of this is basically one of topicality; whichever
argument is intended to be more topical will be placed in the subject (or, more ac-
curately, the A) position.
Some languages, such as Plains Cree, mark both the direct and the inverse clause:
		 Plains Cree (Algic (Algonquian): Canada)
	 (195)	 a.	 ni-wa·pam-im-a·-w-a	 o-kosis-a
			 1-see-obv-dir-3-obv	 3-son-obv
			 ‘I see his son.’
		 b.	 ni-wa·pam-iko-yi-w-a	 o-kosis-a
			 1-see-inv-obv-3-obv	 3-son-obv
			 ‘His son sees me.’  (Dahlstrom 1986:â•›43)
In both sentences in Example (195) there are two arguments, one which is unmarked,
the proximate, and one which is marked, the obviative. With the direct marking it
is the proximate which functions as the most agent-like argument of the clause (also
called the ‘actor’ in literature discussing inverse constructions and obviatives), in this
case the first person. The argument marked in the obviative is thus the patient-like ar-
gument (also called the ‘goal’ in literature discussing inverse constructions and obvia-
tives). With the inverse marking this relationship is swapped: the argument marked
in the obviative (okosisa ‘his son.obviative’) is interpreted as the A (the ‘actor’) of the
clause while the proximate is interpreted as the P (the ‘goal’). The difference between
the two sentences is not quite possible to capture in English; the closest equivalent
would be something like I see his son (a) versus I am seen by his son (b).
9.2.3.2â•‡ Dative shift
Dative shift, a strategy found in English but which is not cross-linguistically common,
seemingly realigns the two objects of a ditransitive clause. Compare the English sen-
tences I gave the book to him with I gave him the book. In the first sentence we have a
direct object (the book) and an indirect object (to him), flagged by the preposition to.
In the second sentence we have what looks like two direct objects (the book and him),
that is, the two objects formally look the same, called double object, as mentioned
above (see 9.1.3.4). We saw above that about a fifth of the languages in Haspelmath’s
(2011a) sample have double objects, while only about ten percent have a mixed system
where a ditransitive clause may have either one direct and one indirect object, or two
272	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
direct objects. Notice that dative shift typically involves the semantic roles of recipient
or benefactive.
Dative shift does not alter the number of participants in the clause; the motivation
for choosing one construction over the other again lies in pragmatic factors such as
topicality.160 However, even if there is a difference in topicality between I gave the book
to him and I gave him the book, the number of obligatory participants remains the
same and as such dative shift is a valency transposing device. Something like *I gave
him or ??I gave the book are not acceptable, except possibly the latter under specific
elliptic contexts (such as an answer to the question What did you end up giving him,
the book or the film? – I gave the book).
9.3	 Simple clauses in sign languages
Alignment of clause participants in sign languages is typically neutral, that is, there
is no overt marking differentiating between the S-argument of an intransitive clause
from the A-argument or P-argument of a transitive clause. These arguments all look
formally the same, irrespective of what grammatical relation or semantic role they
have in the clause, as is the case with spoken English nouns.
Due to the nature of sign languages, verbs (or event signs) show a much greater
degree of modification in accordance with the participants of the clause than spo-
ken languages do. Depending on which participant is the subject (or A) of the clause
and which is the object (or P) of the clause, the spatial movement of the verb will be
modified accordingly. Thus a sentence like I help you will be formed by signing the
movement towards the object (or P) of the clause, you. The movement of the sign will
be reversed if the sentence is You help me, with the movement going from the A (you)
and towards the P (me).
A very common feature with sign languages, in fact probably universal, is the
use of verbal classifiers, as mentioned in 5.3. Here the verb (or event sign) is modi-
fied to incorporate the object of the clause. In other words, if the basic sign for GIVE
is both palms turned upwardsâ•›+â•›movement from the body outwards, a sentence like
I give you a book will be formed by modifying the event sign GIVE to have the hand
shape resemble the sign for book, while the movement of give will remain the same.
160.â•‡ This is again a simplification. It could also be argued that dative shift may function as a valency
increasing device, where a bivalent verb such as write is made trivalent: compare I wrote a letter (two
arguments, I and letter) with I wrote her a letter (three arguments: I, her and letter). Seen this way the
dative shift construction differs from applicative constructions (discussed in Section 9.2.1.2) only in
that the valency increasing strategy involves constituent order and case-marking with dative shift,
while with applicatives it also involves verbal marking.
	 Chapter 9.â•‡ Simple clauses	 273
The sentence I give you a book will thus be expressed something like I BOOK-GIVE
YOU, where the event sign BOOK-GIVE signifies ‘to give a book’. The spatial move-
ment of this complex sign may then be altered according to the syntactic roles of the
participants. In other words, the motion of the event verb will begin at the location of
the subject (A) participant of the clause and end with the indirect object participant,
or recipient (R). This could be analysed as an instance of object agreement, i.e. that the
verb shows agreement with the patient-like argument of the clause as opposed to the
agent-like argument of the clause, a very rare strategy among spoken languages. The
event signs that are possible to modify in this way are often called ‘agreement verbs’
(see, for example, Meir 2002). With event signs that cannot be modified with classi-
fiers (‘plain verbs’) the grammatical relations of the clause are usually, but not always,
determined through word order.
Some sign languages avoid having more than one nominal participant in the
clause, instead chopping up the situations described into several intransitive proposi-
tions. IPSL is an example of such a language, where a sentence like The man lied to
his wife would be expressed as The man lied. His wife was angry. However, transitive
clauses where one participant is expressed with a pronominal are frequent (Zeshan
2003c:â•›170). A similar preference for one-argument clauses can be found in, for ex-
ample, ISL and ABSL (Meir 2010).
An example of a valency increasing causative can be found in Greek Sign Lan-
guage (ENG), where the verb GIVE may be used as an auxiliary to express causation:
		 ENG (Sign Language: Greece)
	 (196)	 INDEX2 2GIVE-AUX3 BURDEN END
		 ‘Stop being a trouble/nuisance to him/her!’  (Pfau & Steinbach 2006a:â•›46)
The auxiliary is used only with intransitives and “transitive psych-verbs”, i.e. verbs
that describe being in a specific psychological state (Pfau & Steinbach 2006a:â•›46). In
Example (196) the psych-verb BURDEN thus means that ‘X is in mental a state of
discomfort’. The auxiliary GIVE161 causativizes the clause and adds the meaning that
‘someone causes X to be in a mental state of discomfort’. An obligatory participant
(the causer) has thus been added to the clause.
While valency reducing devices such as passives are not generally reported for
sign languages, Janzen et al. (2001) argue that the object agreement mentioned above
actually is an instance of passive formation in ASL. Future macro surveys on possible
valency alternating devices in sign languages will shed more light on the fascinating
topic whether the mode of communication affects the types of clauses uttered.
161.â•‡ The difference between the full verb GIVE and the auxiliary GIVE lies mainly in the lack of
non-manual markers for the latter.
274	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
	 9.4	 Summary
The elements that make up a simple clause have various roles and functions. Participants have
different semantic roles in a clause, depending on how they develop the meaning of the clause.
Participants also have different pragmatic roles, reflecting the information flow in the clause.
Finally, participants have different syntactic roles, depending on which function they have in
the grammar of the clause.
In an intransitive clause there is only one argument, the subject (S), while in a transitive
clause there are two arguments, the most agent-like argument (A) and the most patient-like
argument (P). Some languages also have avalent clauses, with no arguments. Languages have
different ways of aligning S, A and P. Languages also differ in how they align the recipient-like
argument (R) and the theme-like argument (T) in ditransitive clauses with the P of monotransi-
tive clauses. Some languages have split systems, where alignments differ in different contexts.
Furthermore, languages differ as to which arguments, if any, they index on the verb.
The valency of the verb can be altered in various ways. Causative constructions increase the
valency by adding a concept of causation, making the argument of causer necessary. Applica-
tives increase the valency by turning an adjunct into an argument. Passives and antipassives
reduce the valency by one, the former by making the A argument optional and the latter by
making the P argument optional. Noun incorporation reduces the valency by incorporating one
of the arguments into the verbal stem, while anticausatives reduce the valency by taking out the
concept of causation. Inversion transposes the valency by swapping the syntactic roles of the A
and P arguments, while dative shift transposes the valency by turning a ditransitive clause into
a double object clause.
Sign languages generally have a neutral alignment. They very commonly, or even univer-
sally, have a subset of verbs that have object agreement in the form of verbal classifiers. Sign
languages frequently show a preference for single argument clauses, except when one or both of
the arguments is a pronoun.While valency adjusting operations do not seem to play a prominent
role in sign language grammars, causative constructions have been reported.

Word order
We have seen that sentences consist of units such as verbs and their arguments. Lan-
guages differ in the way these units, or constituents, are arranged relative to one an-
other, as well as to what extent this arrangement is fixed or flexible. Syntax deals with
how meaningful units may be ordered, both on the clausal and on the phrasal level.
This chapter gives a very brief introductory note on some key concepts in syntax (10.1)
before discussing the typology of word order, that is, the order of the meaningful ele-
ments in a clause or phrase (10.2.1 and 10.2.2). Examples of some typical word order
correlations are given (10.2.3), as well as examples of languages where the word order
is determined by other factors than grammatical relations (10.2.4). Section 10.3 gives
an overview of issues relating to word order in sign languages.
10.1	 A very brief introductory note on syntax
We have seen that smaller units, phonemes and morphemes, may combine to form
larger units, words, which in turn may combine to form even larger units, such as
phrases, clauses and sentences. However, languages do not allow units to be thrown
together haphazardly. For example, noun phrases like the dog or the happy dog are
grammatical, but *dog the and *dog the happy are not, even though they as such con-
tain the same information (it is a specific dog and it is happy). Likewise, while The
dog was chasing the cat is a grammatical sentence in English, something like *Was
chasing the cat the dog is not. Syntax, which derives from the Greek word sýntaxis
‘arrangement’, deals with how words or a set of words are put together, or arranged,
to form grammatical phrases, clauses and sentences. Specifically, syntax deals with
the order or arrangement of constituents, which are the functional elements of any
larger construction. This section is intended as a very brief introductory note on
syntax, with the main purpose of presenting some essential terminology. It makes
no claims whatsoever of presenting a comprehensive discussion of the various is-
sues and traditions in studies of syntax. A very accessible introduction to syntax for
the complete beginner is Tallerman (2005). For an extraordinarily detailed intro-
duction to syntax, where a multitude of perspectives are included, see Givón (2001a
and 2001b).
278	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
10.1.1		 The building blocks of sentences
A sentence consists minimally of a clause, which in turn consists of phrases, which are
made up of one or several words. As Huddleston & Pullum put it
iii.	 Sentences have parts, which may themselves have parts
iii.	 The parts of sentences belong to a limited range of types
iii.	 The parts have specific roles or functions within the larger parts they belong to
 (2002:â•›20)
The way languages tend to structure their lexicon into word classes, or parts-of-
speech, was discussed in Chapter 6. Different types of parts-of-speech may take dif-
ferent syntactic functions in the next larger unit, the phrase.
10.1.1.1â•‡ Phrases
A phrase minimally consists of one word, but may also be a group of words that be-
long together to form one syntactic unit. The entire phrase is classified according to
the category that the head of the phrase belongs to and usually takes the syntactic po-
sition that the head would take. Thus noun phrases, for example, where the head is a
noun (or a substitute for a noun, such as a pronoun), take the positions and functions
that a noun has in the clause (see Chapter 7). Likewise, verb phrases, where the head
is a verb, take the positions and functions that a verb has in the clause (see Chapter 8).
It is very important here to keep in mind that while a constituent may minimally con-
sist of one word, it may also consist of several words or even whole clauses. Thus the
noun phrase the dog consists of two constituents, the and dog. This noun phrase may
in turn be a constituent in the clause The dog was barking, which also consists of two
constituents (the dog and was barking). Further, the entire clause may be a constituent,
as in the sentence The man heard that the dog was barking. Languages may have other
kinds of phrases than NPs and VPs. What follows are some of the most commonly
distinguished ones.
Adjective phrases (AP or AdjP) have an adjective as its head, for example young
in The young doctor was just about to treat his first patient. Adjective phrases may
contain modifiers to the head, such as very in very young (as in, for example, The very
young doctor was just about to treat his first patient). An example of an entire clause
that functions as a modifier to an adjective phrase is that his diagnosis will be wrong
in The doctor is afraid that his diagnosis will be wrong where the underlined sequence
constitutes an AdjP.
Adverb phrases (AdvP) have an adverb as a head, for example, quickly in The man
ran quickly and may also contain modifiers, such as very in The man ran very quickly
(where the AdvP is underlined).
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 279
Adpositional phrases have an adposition as its head, most commonly either a
preposition or a postposition (either PP for both types or, in order to distinguish
between the two, PrepP versus PostP), such as after in The man ran after the bus. Ad-
positional phrases may also consist of several words, for example until after in You’ll
have to wait until after dinner, or entire clauses, such as until they’ve finished their game
in You’ll have to wait until they’ve finished their game (where the PP is underlined).
10.1.1.2â•‡ Clauses
As mentioned in Chapter 9, a clause will consist minimally of a predicate and the argu-
ments of that predicate. This means that if the verb requires one or more argument(s),
the clause will not be grammatical without these arguments.
A simple sentence consists only of one main clause. The man saw the dog is an
example of a simple sentence. A complex sentence consists either of two or more
coordinated main clauses, or a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses.
A main clause is, very simplified, a clause that can function on its own, i.e. which is in-
dependent of any other clause. A subordinate clause, on the other hand, cannot stand
on its own, but is dependent on the main clause. Examples of subordinate clauses
(underlined) are The baby was crying because it was hungry (adverbial clause), The
mother knew that the baby was hungry (complement clause), The nurse, who was very
kind, helped the old man up the stairs (relative clause). For more on complex sentences
and various types of subordinate clauses, see Chapter 11.
10.1.2		 Constituents
The above-mentioned building blocks form functional components, constituents, of
larger structures. As mentioned, phrases generally take the syntactic function and
position in the clause of their head. On the clause level, in addition to the core con-
stituents already discussed, namely the verb and its arguments, a sentence may also
have a complement and an adverbial. A complement is typically an attribute to an
argument, such as a doctor in The woman is a doctor.162 An adverbial is a constituent
that functions as an adverb. While it may consist of an adverb, it does not necessarily
have to. Examples of adverbials (underlined) are:
162.â•‡ It may, however, also be defined as a subcategorized obligatory unit of a head, such as a direct
object of a transitive verb. According to this definition, a book in The man took a book would be a
complement to took, since take is a transitive verb. The reason that subjects are not generally consid-
ered complements according to this definition, even though they too are obligatory to a transitive
verb, is because the subject in this definition is considered a clause-level constituent on par with the
other clause-level constituent, the predicate.
280	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
We arrived early.	 (the adverb early)
We arrived in the evening.	 (the PrepP in the evening)
We arrived the following day.	 (the NP the following day)
We arrived after the others had left.	 (the subordinate clause after the others had left)
On the phrase level constituents typically function as modifiers. Examples of modi-
fiers in the NP are adjectives (or AdjPs), such as red in the red book, numerals, such
as three in the three books, adpositional phrases, such as on the shelf in the book on the
shelf, and so on. Examples of modifiers in the VP are auxiliaries, such as will in will
run, adverbs (or adverbials), such as quickly in run quickly, and so on. Examples of
modifiers in the AdjP are adpositional phrases, such as with the result in happy with
the result, or adverbs (or adverbials), such as very in very happy. Examples of modi-
fiers in the AdvP are adverbs (or adverbials), such as very in very quickly or somewhat
in somewhat hastily.
In order to keep track of how elements group together to form constituents, the
internal structure of a phrase, clause or sentence may be illustrated through bracket-
ing or tree diagrams. The sentence above, for instance, may be analysed as follows:
[[[The] [man]][heard [that [[[the] [dog]] [[was] [barking]]]]]]
Each unit receives its own brackets until the constituents are not further divisible.
The largest unit is the sentence [The man heard that the dog was barking], which
consists of two units, the NP [The man] and the VP [heard that the dog was barking].
These units further consist of two units each: the definite article [the] and the noun
[man] make up one unit, while the verb [heard] and the subordinate clause [that the
dog was barking] make up the other. The latter unit, that the dog was barking, can be
even further divided into the complementizer [that], the NP [the dog] and the VP
[was barking]. Finally, [the dog] may be divided into the definite article [the] and
the noun [dog], while [was barking] may be divided into the auxiliary [was] and the
main verb [barking].
This analysis may also be rendered as a tree diagram, which gives the same infor-
mation as the bracketing, but simply illustrates in it a different manner. The “tree” is
upside-down, with the root at the top and the branches spreading downward. Each
level is connected through a branch and each connecting point of two (or more)
branches forms a node.
This kind of analysis, where each constituent is divided into exactly two parts un-
til no further division is possible, starts with the general assumption that the two core
constituents of the sentence at the highest level are a subject and a predicate. Notice
that each node forms a constituent (which may or may not be further divisible into
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 281
smaller constituents); at no point are constituents divided and lumped together across
constituent boundaries. For example, there is no single node with the sequence man
heard or that the or dog was.163
10.2	 Word order typology
Since the seminal study by Greenberg (1963, reprinted in Greenberg 1990) on the
order of meaningful elements in languages, word order has been a highly prominent
area of research in typology. Strictly speaking ‘word order’ actually refers to constitu-
ent order, and concerns constituents on both clausal and phrasal levels. For accessible
overviews on word order typology, including the history of research on word order
typology, see Song (2009) and (2010). See also Givón (2001a:â•›233ff).
Languages differ in how fixed, or rigid, their word order is. English is an example
of a language with a rigid word order. For instance a sentence like The child stole my
money is not normally possible to express as, for example, *My money stole the child,
*Stole the child my money or *Stole my money the child. This is because the syntactic
roles of the constituents in English are determined by the word order: the subject
163.â•‡ There are other ways of illustrating how the constituents relate to each other, depending on
what tradition is followed. See, for example, Culicover & Jackendoff (2005), for a less hierarchical
analysis, illustrated through so-called flat constituent structures.

comes before the verb and the object comes after it. Thus in the sentence The dog
chased the cat, we assume that the dog is the subject of the sentence and the cat the
object. If we swap the two NPs, giving the sentence The cat chased the dog, the two
NPs by default also swap grammatical relations: the cat is the subject and the dog the
object. However, not all languages are as rigid in their word order as English. Nhanda
is an example of a language with free, or flexible, word (constituent) order.
		 Nhanda (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia)
	 (197)	 abarla-lu	 wumba-yi	 wur’a-tha
		 child-erg	 steal-pperf	 money-1sgobl
		 S		 V	 O
		 abarla-lu	 wur’a-tha	 wumba-yi
		 S		 O	 V
		 wumba-yi	 wur’a-tha	 abarla-lu
		 V		 O	 S
		 wumba-yi	 abarla-lu	 wur’a-tha
		 V		 S	 O
		 wur’a-tha	 wumba-yi	 abarla-lu
		 O		 V	 S
		 wur’a-tha	 abarla-lu	 wumba-yi
		 O		 S	 V
		 ‘The child stole my money.’  (Blevins 2001a:â•›125)
In (197) the case marking makes clear what syntactic roles the arguments have, so the
meaning of the sentence stays the same even if the constituents are swapped around.
Having said this, it is worth to keep in mind that even languages with a rigid word
order can be claimed to allow varied word orders. Consider the following:
	 (198)	 a.	 The child stole my money.			 [SVO]
		 b.	 The child my money stole.			 [SOV]
		 c.	 Stole it, the child did, my money.	 [VSO]
		 d.	 (There it was), stealing my money, the child.	 [VOS]
		 e.	 My money, the child stole.			 [OSV]
Intuitively, any fluent speaker of English would consider (198a) an example of an or-
dinary, declarative, unmarked sentence. All the other sentences are somehow spe-
cial. A sentence like (198b) would only be acceptable in a rhyming context. Sentences
(198c–e) are rewritten in various ways, even the last one, where the comma marks a
pause. In fact the last sentence is only acceptable in a contrastive context (for example,
It left the jewellery and silver, but my money, the child stole.)
Word order typology seeks to map the basic constituent order in languages, which
is not as straightforward to determine as one might initially think. First of all, in Â�
order
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 283
to determine the basic word order of a language, simple declarative sentences are
sought, where both arguments of the verbs are nominal (i.e. consist of a noun and
whatever constituents that belong to it, for example the dog, the big dog, and so on)
and not pronominal. This is because pronominal arguments may follow different
word order rules from nominal arguments. In Italian, for example, the pronoun may
pre-cliticize to the verb, changing the word order from SVO to SOV.
		 Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italy)
	 (199)	 a.	 il	 ragazzo	 ha	 visto	 la	 donna	 [SVO]
			 art	 boy	 aux	 see.ptcpl	 art	 woman
			 S		 V		 O
			 ‘The boy has seen the woman.’
		 b.	 il	 ragazzo	 l’=ha	 visto			 [SOV]
			 art	 boy	 art=aux	 see.ptcpl
			 S		 O	 V
			 ‘The boy has seen her.’  (source: personal knowledge)
Apart from mapping sentences where the arguments of the verbs are nominal, the
sentences also have to be simple declaratives, such as Mary throws the ball (for more
on declaratives, see 12.1.1). As we saw in Example (198), pragmatically marked sen-
tences, where, for example, items are rearranged due to such things as focus and topi-
cality, may take a different word order from the most unmarked kind of declarative.
Therefore it is the pragmatically neutral sentence that is considered to exhibit the
basic word order. Another more marked sentence type is that of questions. In English,
for example, the question word is sentence initial, irrespective of whether it refers to
the subject or the object.164 Compare The man saw the ball (SVO) with the questions
Who saw the ball? (SVO) and What did the man see? (OSV). Again, the less marked
sentence type, the declarative statement, is considered to exhibit the more basic word
order. Often, though by no means always, this is also the most frequent word order
in the language. Frequency is, in fact, the most straightforward factor in determining
basic constituent order. This demands a large amount of varied texts. While it may be
the case that the choice of text will affect the frequency of word order – different sets
of texts might exhibit entirely different word orders – frequency is still a rather neutral
operational test. In languages where one order is considerably more frequent than
the others, anyone examining a large amount of texts is likely to arrive at the same
conclusion. In most languages there is likely to be a dominant word order, but, as we
will see, there are also languages where two or more word orders occur with roughly
164.â•‡ Unless a preposition is involved, in which case the object is clause initial, as in To whom did
you give the ball?
284	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
the same frequency. For more on how to identify the basic word order in a language,
see Dryer (2007b:â•›73ff).
The following sections will discuss patterns of the dominant word order on both
the clause level and phrase level. I am here following Dryer in using the expression
‘dominant word order ’, and not ‘basic word order’ so as “to emphasize that priority
is given […] to the criterion of what is more frequent in language use, as reflected in
texts” (2011b). For details on how Dryer determines the dominant word orders, see
Dryer (2011b).
10.2.1		 Order of clause constituents
There are six logical possibilities to order the core constituents subject (S), verb (V)
and object (O) of a transitive clause: SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV and OVS. To make
the discussion more comparable to other studies, I will refer to core clause constitu-
ents as ‘subject’, ‘verb’ and ‘object’, although these terms are used in a loose semantic
sense where the ‘subject’ of a transitive clause denotes the most agent-like argument
while the ‘object’ of a transitive clause denotes the most patient-like argument of the
clause. As the discussion in Chapter 9 shows, a stricter and more correct notation
would in fact be to list the six possibilities as AVP, APV, VAP, VPA, PAV and PVA.
All six word orders are attested in Dryer’s (2011r) huge database of 1377 languages.
A seventh group of languages consists of those where there is no dominant word or-
der in terms of frequency in pragmatically neutral contexts. Table 10.1 summarizes the
figures (ND stands for ‘no dominant word order’):
Table 10.1â•‡ Word order patterns for three constituents:
S, O and V (Dryer 2011r).
â•›N %
SOV 565 41â•⁄
SVO 488 35.4
VSO 95 6.9
VOS 25 1.8
OVS 11 0.8
OSV 4 0.3
ND 189 13.7
Total 1377 99.9
The vast majority of languages fall into the first two groups, where the subject is the
first constituent of the three. Verb initial languages, the third and fourth groups, are
rather rare. Object initial languages, the fifth and sixth group, are attested, but are very
rare indeed. The group of languages listed as having no dominant order is actually
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 285
bigger than the verb and object initial languages taken together. Examples of the six
different word orders, in descending order of size, are:

SOV word order is spread over the globe in Dryer’s (2011r) sample, but is especial-
ly prominent in Asia (except Southeast Asia and the Middle East) as well as Papua
New Guinea and Northern America (except the Pacific coast). SVO word order is
286	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
especially common in Europe, sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Verb initial
languages (VSO and VOS) are scattered around the world, but are very rare on the
Eurasian continent (except for the Celtic languages in the far west of Europe). VOS
order is not found at all on the Eurasian of African mainland in Dryer’s sample. The
object initial languages in the sample are not found on the Eurasian continent or in
North America. Of the nine OVS languages, six are found in South America, Asuriní
(Tupian (Tupi-Guaraní)), Hixkaryana and Tiriyo in Brazil, Cubeo (Tucanoan (Tu-
canoan)) in Colombia, Urarina (Isolate) in Peru and Selknam in Argentina, two in
Australia (Mangarrayi (Australian: Mangarrayi) and Ungarinjin) and one in Sudan
(Päri). Of the four OSV languages, two are found in South America (Nadëb in Brazil
and Warao in Venezuela), one in Indonesia, Tobati (Austronesian (Oceanic)) and one
in Australia, Wik Ngathana (Australian (Pama-Nyungan)).
The pattern for the APiCS languages differs considerably from that in WALS
(where the proportions do not change after the two contact languages Ndyuka and
Sango – both with SVO word order – have been subtracted from the sample). While
all logical possibilities are attested (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 1) , the vast majority
of the languages, 62 of 76 (or 81.6%) have SVO as their dominant word order, while
only six (7.9%) have SOV. Of the other logical possibilities, three languages (or 3.9%),
Ternateño, Zamboanga and Caviteño, have VSO as their dominant word order and
one (1.3%), Yimas-Arafundi Pidgin, has OSV as its dominant word order. Afrikaans
(Indo-European (Germanic): South Africa), Michif, Pidgin Hindustani and Singlish
(Creole (English-lexified): Singapore) have no dominant word order. VOS and OVS
word orders are attested, but not as the dominant word order for any of the languages
in the database.
Mapping languages for the constituents subject, object and verb (where, I repeat,
the notions of subject and object are in a loose semantic sense of the most agent-like
and most patient-like arguments respectively) requires enough examples of transitive
sentences where both NP arguments are nominal. In fact, it is very often the case in
available descriptions that one or both of the NP arguments in a transitive clause is a
pronoun.165 We have already seen (Example (199)) that languages may have a different
word order for sentences where both arguments are nominal from sentences where
one of the arguments is a pronoun. Very often this is due to the fact that the pronoun
either cliticizes to the verb or is expressed exclusively through verb morphology. It
may also be that the transitive clauses in available texts contain one covert argument,
165.â•‡ Whether or not that reflects actual usage would be an interesting topic for further investi-
gation. A large-scale corpus survey might show that, depending on the genre of the text, simple
transitive declarative sentences more often contain at least one pronominal argument, or one covert
argument, than that both arguments are full nouns.
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 287
that is, one argument that is not spelled out, but is inferred from the context (for in-
stance via verb morphology). This often happens in Salinan, for example:
		 Salinan (Salinan (Salinan): USA)
	 (206)	 ra’m-hala’	 umck’au’yu
		 then-used	 talons
		 ‘Then (he) used his talons.’  (Dryer 1989b:â•›42)
In (206) the subject is covert and is simply inferred from the context (such as the
previous sentences in the narrative). A sentence like this, despite the fact that it has a
transitive verb, does not give adequate information about the order of subject, object
and verb.
Apart from the fact that transitive clauses where both arguments are nominal may
not be easily available, mapping the word order of subject, object and verb also com-
pletely ignores intransitive clauses. One way of getting around both of these problems
is to separately map languages for the order of subject and verb (which would then
include intransitive clauses) and mapping the order of object and verb (which would
make available all those instances where the subject is covert).
Of the 1498 languages in Dryer’s (2011q) sample, the vast majority, 1194 languages
(79.7%) have the dominant order subject-verb (SV) while 194 (13%) have the domi-
nant order VS and 110 languages (7.3%) do not have any dominant order. Again the
languages have been mapped for clauses where the subject is a nominal. The languag-
es with VS are found largely in the same areas as VSO and VOS languages (cf. above).
Examples of SV and VS orders follow:
		 Mbili (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Cameroon)
	 (207)	 [a-bugu	 ya]	 a-yaŋa
		 [cp-hand	 my]	 ce-hurt
		 S		 V
		 ‘My hand hurts.’  (Ayuninjam 1998:â•›327)
		 Roviana (Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands)
	 (208)	 taloa	 [se	 Zima]
		 leave	 [abs	 PN]
		 V	 S
		 ‘Zima left.’  (Corston-Oliver 2002:â•›491)
The majority of the languages in Dryer’s (2011r) and (2011q) databases overlap in the
sense that SOV, SVO and OSV languages are also SV languages, while VSO, VOS and
OVS are also VS languages. However, with some languages the position of the subject
relative to the verb differs between transitive and intransitive clauses. In these cases
Dryer (2011q) lists the languages according to the order of their intransitive clauses.
288	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In Tepehua, for example, transitive clauses where both arguments are nominals typi-
cally have SVO order, while in intransitives the nominal argument typically follows
the verb (VS).
		 Tepehua (Totonacan (Totonacan): Mexico)

		 b.	 maqtali:-n	 ta-‘u-y	 piyu:
			 wild.animal-pl	 3pl.S-eat-ipfv	 chicken
			 S			 V			 O
			 ‘Wild animals eat chickens.’  (Watters 1988:â•›460)
Another instance where Dryer’s two maps do not match is when a language has been
listed as having no dominant order for the constituents subject, object and verb, but
where the reason for this is due to the fact that the position of the object differs relative
to the verb. In other words, a language that has been listed as not having any dominant
order because SVO and SOV are more or less equally frequent, will in the map dealing
with only subject and verb be listed as having SV order. German is an example of such
a language, due to the fact that the word order in subordinate clauses differs from that
of main clauses.
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (210)	 a.	 [der	 Mann]	 kauft	 [einen	 Ball]
			 [art.m.nom	 man]	 buy.3sg.pres	 [art.n.acc	 ball]

			 comp	 [art.m.nom	 man]	 [art.n.acc	 book]	 buy.3sg.pres
			 S				 O		 V
			 ‘I think that the man is buying a ball.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In (210a) we have a main clause declarative sentence, with the typical SVO word order.
However, if the clause is made into a subordinate, as in (210b), the verb is moved to
sentence final position, which automatically changes the word order to SOV.
Dryer (2011o) surveyed 1519 languages for their word order of the object and the
verb. I repeat that the notion of ‘object’ here is in a loose semantic sense and that
is would more accurately be described as the order of P and V. The languages are
mapped for nominal (and not pronominal) objects, for the reasons discussed above.
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 289
However, for this map the subject may be pronominal or covert, since what is crucial
here is simply the order between the verb and the (nominal) object. This fact alone
makes more data available. The two logical orders OV and VO are found to be domi-
nant in almost exactly the same amount of languages (713 or 46.9% with OV and 705
or 46.4% with VO word order), while 101 languages (6.6%) do not have any dominant
order. OV languages are found in most of Asia, Papua New Guinea, North America
and northern South America, as well as in a belt across Africa just under the Sahara.
OV is also quite common in Australia. VO languages are predominantly found in
Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, Meso-America and along the Pacific
North American coast. Examples of the two kinds of word orders follow:
		 Wayampi (Tupian (Tupi-Guaraní): Brazil)
	 (211)	 t-ata	 a-mɔɛnɨ́
		 art-fire	 1sg-light
		 O	 V
		 ‘I light the fire.’  (Grenand 1980:â•›75)
		 Sama Bajau (Austronesian (Sama Bajau): Indonesia)
	 (212)	 kita-ku	 uggo’
		 see-1sg	 pig
		 V		 O
		 ‘I saw the pig.’  (Donohue 1996:â•›784)
Again the languages in Dryer (2011r) and (2011o) mostly overlap, in the sense that lan-
guages with SOV, OVS and OSV word order also have OV order and that languages
with SVO, VSO and VOS order also have VO order. However, there are some mis-
matches between the two samples. First of all, there are some languages that are listed
as not having any dominant word order in Dryer (2011r), but are listed as either VO or
OV in Dryer (2011o). This may be due to the fact that in these languages the position
of the subject varies, but not that of the object. Macushi, for example, has both SOV
and OVS word order with roughly the same frequency, which places it in the group
of languages with no dominant order in Dryer (2011r). Nevertheless, the object fairly
consistently precedes the verb, making it an OV language in Dryer’s database on the
position of the object with respect to the verb (2011o).
Of the 189 languages listed in Dryer (2011r) as not having any dominant order, 39
are listed as having either SV or VS and OV or VO orders respectively in Dryer (2011q
and 2011o).166 In these languages the subject tends to be in the same position relative
to the verb, and the object tends to be in the same position relative to the verb, but the
order of the subject and object relative to each other may vary. Of these, just under 60%
166.â•‡ Cf. also Dryer (2011f).
290	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
are verb initial languages, which may indicate that variability of the position of S and O
is somewhat more common in verb initial languages than in verb final or medial ones.
10.2.2	 Order of phrase constituents
The constituents on the phrase level may also vary with respect to their order. This is
especially true of NPs, where the order of the adjective and noun, genitive and noun,
demonstrative and noun, numeral and noun, and so on may vary. Notice that for
NP constituents we are, again, dealing with lexical constituents (i.e. those containing
nouns) and not pronominal ones for the reasons discussed above.
In a genitive construction, or possessive construction, we have an NP consist-
ing of a head noun (the possessee noun or the possessum) and the genitive noun
phrase (the possessor phrase). The genitive phrase (possessor phrase) describers who
or what the head noun belongs to. Examples of genitive constructions are the man’s
hat, John’s bike and the roof of the house, where the man’s, John’s and of the house are
genitive noun phrases (possessor phrases) and hat, bike and the roof are head nouns
(possessee nouns). There are two logical possibilities for the order of constituents of
genitive constructions, either that the genitive noun phrase precedes the head noun
(abbreviated GenN) or that the genitive noun phrase follows the head noun (abbre-
viated NGen). The majority of languages in Dryer’s (2011l) database, 685 of 1248 (or
54.9%), have a GenN order, while 467 (37.4%) languages have NGen and 96 (7.7%) do
not have any dominant order. English belongs to the latter category, due to the fact
that the genitive phrase either has the ’s or of NP construction (as in John’s bike and
the roof of the house). Examples of the two logical orders are:
		 Evenki (Altaic (Tungusic): Russia)
	 (213)	 kungaka-r	 evike-r-tyn
		 child-pl		 toy-pl-3pl.poss
		 Gen		 N
		 ‘(the) children’s toys’  (Nedjalkov 1997:â•›82)
		 Gela (Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands)
	 (214)	 mimi-na	 bolo
		 bladder-const	 pig
		 N		 Gen
		 ‘(the) pig’s bladder’ (Crowley 2002:â•›530)
The distribution of GenN and NGen is very similar to that of OV and VO respec-
tively, except that GenN is more widespread than OV due to the fact that many SVO
languages are GenN. (For a discussion on where the genitive marking appears in the
genitive construction, see 7.2.1).
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 291
The pattern differs slightly for the APiCS languages, in that the two logical combi-
nations are more evenly distributed than among the WALS languages (Michaelis et al.
2013: feature 2), where the proportions are hardly at all affected by the subtraction of
the two contact languages in the sample, Ndyuka (with no dominant order) and Sango
(with NGen order). Unlike in the WALS database, NGen as the dominant word order
forms the biggest group in APiCS, with 35 of 76 languages (or 46.1%), while GenN is
found in 33 languages (43.4%). The group of languages with no dominant word order
is proportionally larger in APiCS as in WALS, with eight (10.5%) languages.
When it comes to NPs containing an adjective modifying the noun, there are
again two logical word orders: either the adjective may precede the noun (AdjN)
or it may follow the noun (NAdj). English is an example of an AdjN language: in
a red flower the adjective (red) precedes the noun (flower). In Dryer’s (2011h) sam-
ple of 1366 languages the absolute majority, 878 languages (or 64.3%), have NAdj as
their dominating word order, while 373 (27.3%) have AdjN and 110 (8.1%) have no
dominant word order. For five languages (0.4%), Choctaw, Mesa Grande Diegueño
(Hokan (Yuman): USA), Kutenai, Seri and Jamul Tiipay, the closest equivalent to a
modifying adjective is a type of relative clause (see further 11.2.3). Examples of the
two logical orders are:
		 Gününa Küne (Chon (Puelche): Argentina)
	 (215)	 atek	 a	 bahai
		 mountain	 lk	 big
		 N		 Adj
		 ‘big mountain’  (Adelaar & Muysken 2004:â•›562)
		 Assamese (Indo-European (Indic): India)
	 (216)	 dami	 kitap
		 costly	 book
		 Adj	 N
		 ‘costly books’  (Goswami & Tamuli 2007:â•›475)
Languages with NAdj word order are spread over the world in Dryer’s sample, but
are almost entirely absent from the Eurasian mainland except for the far west of Eu-
rope and Southeast Asia, where AdjN word order dominates. Languages with AdjN
word order also form a belt just under the Sahara and along the Northern American
Pacific coast.
The pattern for the APiCS languages differs considerably in that the absolute ma-
jority of the languages (49 of 76 or 64.5%) have AdjN as their dominant word order
while 20 (26.3%) have NAdj and seven languages (9.2%) have no dominant word order
for modifying adjectives and the noun (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 3).
292	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
A demonstrative can either take the form of a free word or an affix (see 6.2.2.1
for more on demonstratives), which can either precede or follow the noun. English
has the demonstratives this/that and these/those (as in this/that book or these/those
books). The logical combinations are thus that either the demonstrative word pre-
cedes the noun (DemN) or follows the noun (NDem). Or the demonstrative affix is
either a prefix on the noun or a suffix on the noun. Lastly, the demonstrative word
or affix may simultaneously precede and follow the noun. In Dryer (2011k) 560 lan-
guages (45.8%) have NDem as their dominant order, just slightly more than the 542
languages of 1223 (44.3%) with DemN as their dominant order. Examples (218) and
(217) show the two orders:
		 Konzime (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Cameroon)
	 (217)	 mʉd	 ɲâ(k)
		 person	 this.cl1
		 N		 Dem
		 ‘this person’  (Beavon 1986:â•›174)
		 Minnesota Ojibwe (Algic (Algonquian): USA)
	 (218)	 a’aw	 wemittokōs̍i
		 that	 Frenchman
		 Dem	 N
		 ‘that Frenchman’  (Schwartz & Dunnigan 1986:â•›300)
Demonstrative affixes are uncommon in the sample, with only nine (0.7%) languag-
es with a demonstrative prefix and 28 (2.3%) with a demonstrative suffix. Barbareño
Chumash is an example of a language with a demonstrative prefix (heʔâ•‚ ‘this’) and
Agar Dinka is an example of a language with a demonstrative suffix (â•‚è̤ ‘this’).
		 Barbareño Chumash (Chumash (Chumash): USA)
	 (219)	 heʔ-l-ʔašḱaʔ
		 this-art-coyote
		 Dem-N
		 ‘this coyote’  (Wash 2001:â•›58)
		 Agar Dinka (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Sudan)
	 (220)	 mò̰ɲ-è̤
		 man.cs1-dem1
		 N-Dem
		 ‘this man’  (Andersen 2002:â•›14)
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 293
To have a simultaneous demonstrative word or affix both preceding and following
the noun is also rare, found in 17 languages (1.4%). An example of such a language is
Malagasy.
		 Malagasy (Austronesian (Barito): Madagascar)
	 (221)	 io	 trano	 io
		 this	 house	 this
		 Dem	 N	 Dem
		 ‘this house’  (Keenan & Polinsky 1998:â•›567)
Note that both elements in (221) need to flank the noun for the phrase to be gram-
matical; something like *io trano or *trano io is not acceptable. For 67 languages
(5.5%) no order or strategy is dominant. Languages where the demonstrative pre-
cedes the noun (whether as a free word or a prefix) are very common on the Eurasian
mainland in Dryer’s sample, except for the far west of Europe and Southeast Asia.
They are also very common in both North and South America. Languages where the
demonstrative follows the noun are particularly common in Africa, Southeast Asia
and Papua New Guinea.
The figures for the languages in APiCS are at the time of writing still temporary
for this feature, but they seem to differ somewhat in their pattern from those in WALS
(where the pattern is not noticeably affected by the subtraction of the two contact lan-
guages in the sample, Ndyuka and Sango, both NDem). More than half seem to have
DemN as their dominant order, while only just under at third have NDem (MichaelisÂ�
et al. 2013: feature 5). Only very few seem to lack any dominant word order for demon-
stratives and even fewer seem to have any demonstrative affix.
Languages also differ with respect to the relative position of the numeral and the
noun in such phrases where the number of things are referred to (for which cardinal
numbers are used, as opposed to when the rank in the order of items is referred to,
for which ordinal numbers are used). Of the 1154 languages in Dryer’s (2011n) sample,
the majority, 608 (or 52.7%), have the numeral following the noun (NNum) as their
dominant order, while in 479 languages (41.5%) the numeral preceding the noun is the
dominant order and 65 languages (5.6%) have no dominant order. The languages in
Dryer’s sample with NNum as their dominant order predominate in sub-Saharan Af-
rica and a limited area of Southeast Asia stretching roughly from Nepal to Cambodia
and Papua New Guinea. Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East and Asia are almost
entirely dominated by languages with NumN order, except for the aforementioned
area in Southeast Asia. NumN languages also predominate along the Pacific coast of
North America and North-western South America. English is an example of the latter,
as in five books. Other examples are:
294	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Buma (Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands)
	 (222)	 mwoe	 tili
		 house	 five
		 N		 Num
		 ‘five houses’  (Tryon 2002:â•›576)
		 Hungarian (Uralic (Ugric): Hungary)
	 (223)	 négy	 toll
		 four	 pen
		 Num	 N
		 ‘four pens’  (Kenesei et al. 1998:â•›96)
approximation through word order
East Slavic languages have the typologically very rare strategy of expressing approximation
(‘about X, roughly X’) by inverting the word order of numeral and noun:
		 Russian (Indo-European (Slavic): Russia)
	 a.	 na	 dva	 mal’čika
		 prq	 two	 boy.sg.gen
		 ‘two boys’
	 b.	 mal’čika	 na	 dva
		 boy.sg.gen	 prq	 two
		 ‘about two boys’ (Billings 1995:â•›31,â•›33)
In two languages in Dryer’s sample (0.2%), Wari’ and Arára Karó, the only normal
way of expressing a numeral is a construction where the numeral does not modify the
noun but the verb.
		 Arára Karó (Tupian (Ramarama): Brazil)
	 (224)	 maʔwɨt	 ip	 ʔɨy	 matet	 cagárokōm=nem
		 man	 fish	 catch.ind	 yesterday	 two=advz
		 ‘The man caught two fish yesterday.’  (Dryer 2011n citing Gabas, Jr 1999:â•›172)
In (224) the numeral takes the form and position of an adverb in a construction which
is similar to the English sentence The men have both gone, where both takes the posi-
tion of an adverbial.
The figures for the languages in APiCS are at the time of writing still temporary
for this feature, but they seem to indicate that pattern among in the APiCS sample
differs a great deal from that in WALS (where the subtraction of Ndyuka (NumN) and
Sango (NNum) does not affect the pattern noticeably). In APiCS it seems as if almost
nine tenths have NumN as their dominant order, while only a few languages have
NNum as their dominant order (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 6).
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 295
There seems to be a certain correlation between the various word orders dis-
cussed above, in that some modifiers seem to parallel each other with respect to
word order. For instance, the majority of the AdjN languages in the printed version
of WALS (Haspelmath et al. 2005) are also DemN, and the majority of DemN lan-
guages are also NumN. Conversely, slightly more than half of the NAdj languages
are also NDem and the majority of NDem languages are also NNum. This is, how-
ever, by no means any set rule and is only a rather weak tendency. Furthermore, the
tendency only holds on a binary basis, that is, if we combine two features with each
other. Thus, if we combine all features of GenN + AdjN + DemN + NumN (that is,
all those instances discussed above where the modifier167 precedes the noun) we get
144 languages, and if we combine the features NGen + NAdj + NDem + NNum (that
is, all those instances where the modifier follows the noun) we get 116 languages, the
sum of which (260) is only about a quarter of the languages in Dryer’s (2005a, 2005b,
2005c and 2005d) maps.
10.2.3	 Constituent order correlations
The position of the verb tends to correlate with a number of other word orders on
different levels. This is especially true when it comes to the position of the verb with
respect to the object. OV languages typically behave in one way while VO languages
typically behave in a different way. The following will list some, but by no means all,
typical characteristics of OV and VO languages respectively. I stress, however, that
these are tendencies and not absolute universals. For a very detailed discussion on
word order correlations, see Dryer (2007b). It is beyond the scope of this chapter to
discuss the various attempts at explanations for why languages exhibit the word order
patterns and correlations that they do. For a very accessible overview of the various
theories that have been put forth, see Song (2009). See also Dryer (2007b:â•›130f) for
further references.
10.2.3.1â•‡ OV languages
Most OV languages are verb final languages, i.e. languages where the verb follows
both the subject and the object, except for the rare OVS languages, which are essen-
tially verb medial.
An example of a fairly typical OV language is Khwarshi, which displays a number
of characteristics with respect to constituent order that are commonly found in OV
languages. First of all, obviously the object precedes the verb.
167.â•‡ For the sake of simplicity I am here treating a genitive construction as a modifier plus noun,
along the lines that the genitive phrase provides specifying or descriptive information about the
noun, much in the same way as a demonstrative does.
296	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Khwarshi (Nakh-Daghestanian (Avar-Andic-Tsezic): Russia)
	 (225)	 obu-t’-i	 lɨdo	 b-ɨt’-x-i
		 father-obl-erg	 firewood(III)	 III-divide-caus-past.w
				 O	 V
		 ‘The father chopped the firewood.’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›69)
In OV languages, the adverb typically precedes the verb:
	 (226)	 xexiłin	 Muħamad	 ø-ot’uq’-še	 golło
		 fast	 Magomed(I)	 I-come-pres	 be.pres.cond
		 Adv					 V
		 ‘If only Magomed would come quickly.’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›252)
In (226) the adverb xexiłin ‘fast, quickly’ is placed prior to the verb øot’uq’še ‘come.
present tense’ and its auxiliary golło ‘would’.
Khwarshi is also typical in that the genitive phrase (possessor phrase) precedes
the head noun (the possessee or possessum):
	 (227)	 obu-t’-ɨs	 tubi
		 father-obl-gen1	 gun
		 Gen	 N
		 ‘father’s gun’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›70)
When comparisons are made, we need a standard of comparison (St), a marker of
comparison (M) and an adjective (Adj), as in Mary is taller than Jane, where Jane is
the standard of comparison (she is what we are comparing with), than is the marker
of comparison (i.e. the marker indicating that X is being compared with Y) and
taller is the adjective of comparison. In OV languages the standard of comparison
is typically followed by the marker of comparison, which is in turn followed by the
adjective:
	 (228)	 Qurban	 Nazir-λ’o-zi-n	 lebala-w	 goli
		 Kurban(I)	 Nazir-sup-abl-and	 brave-I	 be.pres
			 St	 M	 Adj
		 ‘Kurban is braver than Nazir.’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›76)
In (228) we are comparing Kurban with Nazir, so Nazir is the standard of comparison.
The marker, indicating that comparison is being made, is here the suffix â•‚λ’o, which
attaches to the standard of comparison (Nazir). The adjective of comparison, lebalaw
‘brave’, follows the construction standard-marker (Nazir-λ’o-).
In OV languages adpositions tend to follow the noun, i.e. are postpositions, as in
(229) where λ’olo ‘above’ is placed after the noun γoboλ’o ‘pile.case marker’:
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 297
	 (229)	 γobo-λ’o	 λ’olo	 γur-a-ba	 l-eč-i
		 pile-sup	 above	 stone-obl-pl.abs	 nhpl-be-past.w
		 N	 Po
		 ‘There were stones on the top of the pile.’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›135)
That an OV language like Khwarshi has postpositions is, in fact, a bidirectional im-
plicational universal (cf. 2.3.2). That is, the correlation between OV languages and
postpositions is so strong that we may claim that a postpositional language is an OV
language, and, conversely, if the language is OV then it will have postpositions. Other
examples of bidirectional correlations with OV languages are that the adpositional
phrase precedes the verb and that the auxiliary follows the verb.
	 (230)	 [miljljo	 b-oλoλ’o]	 henše	 gul-o
		 [2pl.gen2	 III-in.middle]	 book(IIII)	 put-imp
		 PP			 V
		 ‘Put the book between you!’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›42)
In (230) the adpositional phrase miljljo boλoλ’o ‘between you.plural’ precedes the verb
gulo ‘put’.
	 (231)	 íljo	 b-odo-še	 goli
		 1pl.abs	 hpl-work-pres	 be.pres
			 V	 Aux
		 ‘We are working.’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›188)
In (231) the auxiliary goli ‘are’ follows the lexical verb bodoše ‘working’.
Khwarshi is also typical for an OV language in that it does not have articles. How-
ever, while the majority of OV languages lack articles, it is a bidirectional correlation
that if an OV language has articles, then the article will follow the noun, and con-
versely, if in a language the article follows the noun, then it is highly likely to be an OV
language. Mugil is an example of an OV language that has articles:
		 Mugil (Trans-New Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (232)	 in	 karuw	 araʔ	 yag-01168-iy
		 they	 animal	 a	 give.me-past-n1p
			 N (O)	 Art	 V
		 ‘They gave me a pig.’  (Hepner 2006:â•›28)
168.â•‡ The notation 01 indicates a place holder for a zero morpheme indicating either tense or mood
(Hepner 2006:â•›11).
298	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (232) the object, the noun karuw ‘animal’, precedes the verb, yagiy ‘gave’, so it is an
OV language. Furthermore, the article araʔ ‘a’ follows the noun it classifies (karuw).
Mugil thus conforms to the typical pattern of OV languages with articles.
10.2.3.2â•‡ VO languages
VO languages comprise both the verb initial languages with VSO and VOS word or-
der, and the large group of verb medial languages with SVO order. They are in many
ways the mirror image of OV languages. SVO languages behave almost exactly like
verb initial languages, except when it comes to the order of the genitive phrase and
the head noun, as we will see below. To illustrate the similarities between verb initial
languages and SVO languages, I will give examples of both a verb initial language and
an SVO language; unless otherwise stated, the following examples are from San Bar-
tholomé Zoogocho Zapotec and English.
		 San Bartholomé Zoogocho Zapotec (Oto-Manguean (Zapotecan): Mexico)
	 (233)	 dx-aogo	 be’ko’	 yet
		 cont-eat	 dog	 tortilla
		 V		 O
		 ‘The dog is eating tortillas.’  (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›126)
	 (234)	 The	 dog	 is	 eating	 tortillas.
					 V		 O
As Examples (233) and (234) show, irrespective of whether the verb is sentence initial
or not, the relative order between the verb and the object is the same for both lan-
guages.
In VO languages, the adverb tends to follow the verb:
	 (235)	 ble=na’	 dx-lonhgh=e’	 sholazhe
		 clan=demdist	 cont-run=3fm	 slowly
			 V	 Adv
		 ‘That person runs slowly.’  (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›161)
	 (236)	 That	 person	 runs	 slowly.
					 V			 Adv
It should be noted, however, that the position of the adverb is relatively free in San
Bartholomé Zoogocho Zapotec (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›251; adverbs may also vary some
in English). An example of aVO language where the adverb has a more rigid order is
Fijian, where the manner adverb follows the verb (Dixon 1988:â•›63).
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 299
		 Fijian (Austronesian (Oceanic): Fiji)
	 (237)	 bau	 ‘ada	 va’a.totolo	 noo
		 modif	 run	 quickly	 asp
			 V	 Adv
		 ‘Try and run more quickly.’  (Dixon 1988:â•›80)
In VO languages the adpositions tend to precede the noun (or noun phrase), i.e. are
prepositions:
	 (238)	 lenh	 yaa	 wag
		 with	 iron	 wood
		 Pr		 NP
		 ‘with an axe’  (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›332)
	 (239)	 with	 an	 axe
		 Pr		 NP
In genitive constructions verb initial languages tend to have the order NGen. How-
ever, with SVO languages, both NGen and GenN orders are common. English is an
example of a language with no dominant order for genitive constructions (cf. Ex-
ample (241)), but for most SVO languages a dominant order of either NGen or GenN
can be identified.
	 (240)	 yichgh	 bedw

In comparative constructions in VO languages, the marker of comparison tends to
follow the adjective, and the standard of comparison tends to follow the marker of
comparison:
	 (242)	 n-ak=dx	 bdxee	 be	 lis	 kleka’	 be’ko’
		 stat-be=more	 ant	 clan	 small	 than	 dog
						 Adj	 M	 St
		 ‘Ants are smaller than dogs.’  (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›232)
	 (243)	 Ants	 are	 smaller	 than	 dogs.
					 Adj	 M	 St
300	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (242) the adjective lis ‘small’ precedes the marker of comparison kleka’, which in
turn precedes the standard of comparison (the thing we are comparing with), be’ko’
‘dog’. As (243) shows, English exhibits the same pattern. With the bidirectional cor-
relations, again VO languages are essentially the mirror image of OV languages. Thus
the adpositional phrase follows the verb, the auxiliary precedes the verb, and the ar-
ticle precedes the noun.
	 (244)	 sh-chog=a’	 yag-en	 [lenh	 yaa	 wag]
		 cont-cut=1sg	 tree-det	 [with	 iron	 wood]
		 V			 PP
		 ‘I cut the tree with an axe.’  (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›332)
	 (245)	 I	 cut	 the	 tree	 [with an axe].
			 V			 PP
In (245) the prepositional phrase lehn yaa wag ‘with an axe’ is placed to the right of the
verb; English exhibits the same pattern.
In VO languages the auxiliaries, if and when used, tend to be placed before the
lexical verb:
	 (246)	 dx-eyala	 si-i=e’	 shon	 gayoa
		 cont-should	 pot-grab=3f	 three	 hundred
		 Aux	 V
		 ‘She should grab three hundred.’  (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›216)
	 (247)	 She	 should	 grab	 three	hundred.
			 Aux	 V
Finally, articles tend to precede the noun in VO languages:
	 (248)	 b-enh	 bidao	 neda’	 to	 libr
		 compl-give	 child	 1sg	 one	 book
					 Art	 N
		 ‘The child gave me a book.’  (Sonnenschein 2004:â•›157)
	 (249)	 The	child	 gave	 me	 a	 book.
							 Art	 N
10.2.4	 Flexible word order
A number of languages have so-called ‘flexible’ (or ‘free’) word orders, where the order
of the constituents is not determined by syntactic roles, such as subject and object,
but by some other principle. In some languages the order is determined by semantic
factors such as animacy, in others by various pragmatic factors such as topicality or
focus, or information structure, in yet others the word order is determined by gram-
matical factors such as aspect. In Navajo, for example, the order of the subject and
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 301
object is dependent on the relevant NP’s position on the animacy hierarchy according
to the following principles:
human > animals (large > medium > small) > insects > natural forces > plants & inanimate
	 objects > abstract notions
The ranking thus not only takes animacy into account, but, with animals, also size. In
other words, a bigger animal ranks higher than a smaller one, a small animal ranks
higher than an insect, and so on. The NP ranking higher on the hierarchy appears
further to the left in the sentence.
		 Navajo (Na-Dene (Athapaskan): USA)
	 (250)	 a.	 dóola	 dibé	 yiyiisxį́	 b.	 *dibé	 dóola	 biyiisxį́
			 bull	 sheep	 killed		 sheep	 bull	 killed
			 S	 O	 V
			 ‘The bull killed the sheep.’  (Uyechi 1996:â•›124)
		 c.	 *toís’ná	 na’astǫǫsí	 yishish	 d.	 na’astǫǫsí	 toís’ná	 bishish
			 bee	 mouse	 stung		 mouse	 bee	 stung
												 O	 S		 V
			 ‘The bee stung the mouse.’  (Uyechi 1996:â•›124)
In (250) the order of the subject and object relative to each other are not dependent
on grammatical relations, but on position on the animacy hierarchy. Thus, (250a) is
grammatical, since the bull is bigger than the sheep, but (250c) is not, since the mouse
is higher up on the hierarchy than the bee. The mouse therefore has to precede the bee
in word order, as in (250d), irrespective of what syntactic role it has.169
Cayuga is an example of a language where the object either precedes of follows the
verb, depending on pragmatic factors.
		 Cayuga (Iroquoian (Northern Iroquoian): USA)
	 (251)	 a.	 katsihwá’	 kihsa:s
			 hammer	 1sg.seek
			 O	 V
			 ‘I’m looking for a hammer.’ (said in shop, with no particular hammer in mind)
		 b.	 to:	 ti’	 nika:nô:’	 nê:kyê	 katsíhwa’
			 how	 then	 so.it.costs	 this	 hammer
					 V		 O
			 ‘How much does this hammer cost?’ (indicating specific hammer)
 (Mithun 1992:â•›28)
169.â•‡ The person marking on the verb alternates between yiâ•‚ and biâ•‚ depending on whether or
not the word order has been ‘inverted’ (i.e. with the object placed before the subject). See further
Uyechi (1996).
302	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (251a) the object is a non-specific newly introduced piece of information or item
and thus comes early in the clause. In (251b) the object is a specifically identified item
and thus appears later in the clause.
In Yi the word order varies according to the grammatical aspect of the proposi-
tion. In clauses denoting ongoing events, the order is SOV, while in clauses denoting
resultative events, the order is OSV.
		 Yi (Sino-Tibetan (Burmese-Lolo): China)
	 (252)	 a.	 m̩33ka55	 ʂa33ma55	 kvṵ33	 ȡʑɔ33
			 PN		 PN		 frighten	 cont
			 S		 O	 V
			 ‘Muga is frightening Shama.’ (ongoing)
		 b.	 lo55ȶɕɨ́33	 ȶɕi33	 ŋa33	 ȡʑɔ33	 ko44ʂa33	 o44
			 finger	 cl	 1sg	 fell	 send	 dp
			 O			 S	 V
			 ‘I have cut off my finger.’ (resultative)  (Gerner 2004:â•›114, 117)
In (252a) the event is ongoing, and the subject precedes the object. In (252b), however,
we have an event in the resultative, and the subject follows the object.
In these kinds of languages it is only accurate to label it ‘flexible’ word order if the
criterion is the position of constituents according to grammatical relations, since they
are only flexible in the sense that constituents with various syntactic roles may appear
in different positions. However, the word order in the above-mentioned languages
may be said to be rigid with respect to other criteria, such as animacy, pragmatic roles
or whatever else it is that determines the position of the constituents.
10.3	 Word order in sign languages
We have seen that it is less than straightforward to determine the basic word order
for spoken languages. In a sense, it is even less straightforward for signed languages.
This is partly because it is less common in signed languages than in spoken languages
to have clauses containing two overt nominal arguments; in fact it seems to be very
common indeed for all known sign languages to allow clauses that only contain the
verb, where the arguments are covert and only implied through context. This is espe-
cially true for clauses with pronominal arguments, but also nominal arguments may
be covert, as in Example (253). Some sign languages, such as IPSL, avoid clauses with
more than one nominal argument altogether (Zeshan 2003c).
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 303
		 AdaSL (Sign Language: Ghana)
	 (253)	 MOVE FLY-TO-SIDE BALL TAKE:CL-round LIFT&THROW:CL-round ENTER
		 ‘(The bird) flew to the side, took (a) ball and threw it inside.’  (Nyst 2007:â•›165)
In (253) the subject (the bird) is not overtly expressed, but has to be inferred from the
context.
With pronouns it is common for a clause to lack both arguments, since the verb
may agree with both the subject and the object through direction. The pronouns are
indicated with subscript number, where 1 means ‘fist person’ and 2 ‘second person’.
		 LIU (Sign Language: Jordan)
	 (254)	 1TELL2
		 ‘I tell you.’  (Hendriks 2008:â•›59)
In (254) the sign for TELL involves the motion from the subject (whoever does the
telling) towards the object (whoever is being told). Reversing the sign to 2TELL1
would therefore reverse the meaning to ‘You tell me’. In both cases the arguments are
only marked through agreement on the verb (the direction of the motion) and are not
overtly signed.
Nevertheless, while the word order is typically less rigid in signed languages, a ba-
sic word order has been determined for a number of sign languages. ST, for example,
is SVO, while DGS is SOV.
		 ST (Sign Language: Sweden)
	 (255)	 DRIVER	 WASH	 CAR
		 S			 V	 O
		 ‘The driver washed the car.’  (Ahlgren & Bergman 2006:â•›43)
		 DGS (Sign Language: Germany)
	 (256)	 MAN	 BOOK	 BUY
		 S		 O		 V
		 ‘The man buys a book.’  (source: personal knowledge)
While there are no large-scale surveys of the word order in sign languages yet,
Map 10.1 gives an overview of 30 sign languages. Notice that the word order of the
sign language is independent from the word order of the spoken language in the area.
Thus BSL has no dominant order, while spoken English has SVO as its dominant or-
der, and while LSA in Argentina has SOV word order, spoken Spanish has SVO as its
dominant word order.
304	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Map 10.1â•‡ Word order in 30 sign languages. Black dots: SVO (12 languages); black squares:
SOV (5 languages); black triangles: OSV (2 languages); white dots: flexible word order
(11 languages). For a full legend, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/z.176.additional.
The most common word order reported is SVO, while SOV – the most common word
order for spoken languages – has only been reported for five languages: ABSL, LSA,
ÖGS, DGS and NS. OSV has been reported as the basic word order in CSL (Massone
& Curiel 2004), and possibly also in UKSL (Kakumasu 1968). A much higher propor-
tion of sign languages than spoken languages have a flexible word order based on
pragmatic factors such as topic and comment. Most typically the topic of the proposi-
tion is signed first.
It will be a matter for future research to investigate which word order correlations
can be established for sign languages and to what extent this mirrors or differs from
the correlations found for spoken languages.
	 10.4		 Summary
Languages tend to organize their utterances structurally according to some principle. Syntax
investigates how meaningful units, or constituents, group together to form larger units, which
in turn group together to form grammatical sentences. Constituents may be arranged in various
ways, and some languages are more rigid in which kinds of arrangements they allow than others.
Word order typology investigates the various ways constituents may be ordered and how
the various orders pattern across the world. When investigating the dominant constituent order
on any given level, whether phrasal or clausal, the focus is on unmarked declarative sentences
where the argument or arguments of the verb are nominal and not pronominal.
	 Chapter 10.â•‡ Word order	 305
On the clause level the patterns may either differ greatly or be rather balanced depending
on how many and which constituents are being mapped.Thus the vast majority of languages are
SV and notVS, while the ordersVO and OV are equally common. For transitive clauses, the major-
ity of languages are either SOV or SVO, but all six logical possibilities are attested in the world.
Phrase constituents may also vary with respect to word order.There tends to be a correlation
between clausal and phrasal constituent orders, especially between the order of the object and
the verb and various phrasal word orders.
Some languages have so-called flexible word order in that they organize their constituents
according to other criteria than grammatical relations, such as pragmatic roles or animacy.
Sign languages also vary with respect to their constituent orders. SVO seems rather common
but others are attested. However, most sign languages are more flexible in their word order than
spoken languages, and with many the word order is determined by pragmatic factors.

Complex clauses
We have seen that languages have ways of combining elements into larger units, where
the elements take their various roles within the larger unit. Languages may also com-
bine elements to jointly take a certain role in a larger unit. Combined units may be of
the same or of different ranks. Section 11.1 gives an overview of the main features of
coordinated clauses, where units of the same rank are linked together to form a com-
plex clause. In Section 11.2 the three main types of subordinated clauses are discussed:
those that serve as arguments to their matrix (11.2.1), those that serve as adjuncts to
their matrix (11.2.2) and those that serve as NP modifiers (11.2.3). Section 11.3 briefly
summarizes the notion of cosubordination, where clauses neither are embedded in
each other nor can function independently. This specifically relates to serial verb con-
structions (11.3.1) and clause chaining (11.3.2). Finally, Section 11.4 sketches some of
the characteristics of complex clauses in sign languages.
11.1	 Coordination
Coordination is when linguistic units of the same syntactic status are linked to-
gether to form a larger linguistic unit which carries the same function as its parts.
For instance, a clause may have a subject, a verb and an object, as in The man boiled
the water. However, we may combine two verbs and still get a clause with a subject,
verb and object, as in The man boiled and poured the water, where both boiled and
poured combine on the same level to jointly carry out the same function of the clause
predicate. This may also be done with phrases, as in The man and the woman boiled
the water, where the man and the woman combine on the same level, or it may be
done with full clauses, as in The man boiled the water and the woman filled the teapot,
where the man boiled the water and the woman filled the teapot combine on the same
level. What is crucial here is that none of the combined units are dependent on each
other. It is not essential for the verb boil to be combined with the verb pour in order
to make a well-formed clause, nor is it essential for the NP the man to combine with
the NP the woman in order to make the clause complete, nor for the two clauses The
man boiled the water plus The woman filled the teapot to be combined in order to
make a grammatical sentence. In other words, independent units are coordinated
with each other.
308	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
All known languages have some way of combining elements of the same levels
into larger units where they jointly have a certain function, but the strategies may
differ. Units may be coordinated by simply placing them next to each other (juxta-
position), as in I came in, sat down, crossed my legs. Or an overt linker may be used,
a coordinator (also called coordinating conjunction).170 The most frequently used
coordinator is the conjunctive coordination (or conjunction) and (as in I came in
and sat down). Other coordinators are the disjunctive coordination (or disjunction)
or (as in I wanted an apple or a pear), the adversative coordination but (I was tired but
happy), and the causal coordination for (as in I fell asleep, for I was exhausted). For an
accessible typological overview of coordination, see Haspelmath (2007), which this
section relies heavily on.
11.1.1		 Asyndetic coordination
Asyndetic coordination, or juxtaposition (also called the ‘zero strategy’, cf. Payne
1985b:â•›25ff), is the coordination of units without any overt linker. The term itself de-
rives from Greek a-sýndetos ‘not-bound.together’. This is a very common strategy in
the world. Many languages permit juxtaposition even though it has coordinators, as is
the case in English: compare the sentences Quietly and furtively the detective searched
the desk of the suspect and Quietly, furtively the detective searched the desk of the sus-
pect where the coordinator (underlined) in the first sentence is simply omitted in
the second. In English juxtaposition is stylistically marked and is generally used to
achieve specific effects in written language. Juxtaposition is also possible for clauses in
English, although it also tends to be stylistically marked. Compare the sentence John
saw Mary and Mary smiled at him with John saw Mary. Mary smiled at him. Notice
that with juxtaposition intonation is the only way to signal that we have a coordinated
construction (illustrated in the English examples with punctuation, such as commas
or full stops), that is, intonation is the only indicator that the units we are linking be-
long together in a larger unit.
In many languages juxtaposition is the default method of coordination, although
they may have optional overt linkers. Rapanui is an example of a language where co-
ordination is normally expressed through juxtaposition, both for words, phrases and
clauses:
170.â•‡ Due to the similarity between the terms coordinating conjunction and conjunctive coordination,
I am here following Haspelmath (2007) and using the term coordinator to indicate the overt linker
of units in coordinating constructions.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 309
		 Rapanui (Austronesian (Oceanic): Easter Island)
	 (257)	 a.	 me’e	 nehe 	 nehe	 iti 	 iti	 era	 ko	 ia

			 ‘I went off (and) came to see him, (and) when I had got there, (and) he had
seen me, he said to me…’  (Du Feu 1996:â•›85,â•›88)
In (257a) the adjectives nehe nehe ‘pretty (reduplicated)’ and iti iti ‘small (redupli-
cated)’ are coordinated; they are simply juxtaposed. In (257b) the verb phrases (he)
a’a kiruŋa ‘get up’ and (he) u’i ‘look’ are also simply juxtaposed, as are the coordinated
clauses in (257c), indicated in the example by commas. This is also the default strategy
for disjunctive coordinations (‘or’-coordination):
		 Rapanui (Austronesian (Oceanic): Easter Island)
	 (258)	 he	 oro	 ki	 te	 po’e	mo	 kai,	 he	 inaki	 koe	 ki	 te	 kiko
		 actn	 grate	 dat	 spe	 po’e	ben	 eat	 actn	 accompany	 2sg	 dat	 spe	 meat
		 ‘You grate it to make po’e (or) you use it to accompany meat.’  (Du Feu 1996:â•›87)
In (258) the two clauses are disjunctively coordinated through juxtaposition only, in-
dicated by a comma.171
171.â•‡ It should be noted that conjunctive and disjunctive coordination may in Rapanui optionally be
marked with a linker borrowed from Spanish. It is very common for languages with no coordinators
that have been colonized to adopt the coordinators of the colonizing language. Very often this is due
to the bilingual setting of societies that were colonized, and it seems reasonable to assume that one
pulling factor for borrowing coordinators is the emerging literacy: many languages with overt coor-
dinators have a long literary tradition – coordination by juxtaposition is dependent on intonation,
which does not show in written language. For languages with a young literary tradition the need
for overt coordination markers is thus recent and a convenient way of filling that need is to simply
import the necessary marker. The colonizing language is then typically the easiest available source.
See further Mithun (1988). For more on linguistic borrowing, see 13.2.
310	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
11.1.2		 Syndetic coordination
Syndetic coordination (from Greek sýndetos ‘bound.together’), sometimes also called
linked coordination, involves an overt linking device, or coordinator (often called
conjunction). The coordinators may either precede the unit they are coordinating
(prepositive coordinators) or may follow the units they are coordinating (postpositive
coordinators), and they may be either free words or bound clitics. Furthermore, if two
units are being coordinated, this may be done with only one coordinator, as in English
(A and B) or with two coordinators (something like A and B and). Coordination done
with only one coordinator may be termed monosyndetic, while bisyndetic coordina-
tion involves two overt linkers. Each strategy will be exemplified below. For the sake
of simplicity, I will here limit the discussion to binary coordinations only, that is, when
only two elements are coordinated. Following Haspelmath (2007) I will label the overt
linker co (for coordinator) and the two units that get coordinated A and B respectively.
Due to space limitations, the focus will be on conjunctions. In English the con-
junction appears in the same position as other coordinators, such as disjunctions
(compare pizza and pasta with pizza or pasta). This need not be the case. In Khwarshi,
for example, while conjunctions and disjunctions are both bisyndetic, the former is
postpositive while the latter is prepositive:
		 Khwarshi (Nakh-Daghestanian (Avar-Andic-Tsezic): Russia)
	 (259)	 a.	 bataxu-n	 k’oro-n
			 bread.v-and	 cheese.iv-and
			 ‘bread and cheese’
		 b.	 ya	 kad	 ya	 uže
			 or	 girl	 or	 boy
			 ‘girl or boy’  (Khalilova 2009:â•›311f)
As mentioned in 6.2.2.6, languages differ as to whether they have the same coordina-
tor for NPs as they do in VPs and clauses. Languages also differ as to whether or not
the conjunction is the same word as the comitative (‘with’). In English the NP con-
junction differs from the comitative: The man and the woman went to the market (NP
conjunction) versus The man went to the market with the woman (comitative phrase).
This is slightly more common than to use the same marker for the two constructions:
of the 234 languages in Stassen’s (2011) database, 131 (or 56%) differentiate between
conjunctions and comitatives, while 103 (or 44%) do not. An example of a language
where the two are not differentiated is Babungo:
		 Babungo (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Cameroon)
	 (260)	 Làmbí	 nə̀	 Ndùlá	 gə̀	 táa	 yìwìŋ
		 PN	 and/with	 PN	 go.pfv	 to	 market
		 ‘Lambi and Ndula went to the market’ / ‘Lambi went to the market with Ndula.’
 (Schaub 1985:â•›84)
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 311
The proportions in the WALS sample do not change with the subtraction of the two
contact languages in the sample, Haitian Creole and Sango, none of which differentiate
between ‘and’ and ‘with’. The figures for the languages in APiCS are at the time of writ-
ing still temporary for this feature, but they seem to exhibit a similar pattern, in that
differentiation is somewhat more common than not (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 71).
In about a fifth of the languages there seems to be an overlap between the two markers
in that one marker may function both as a conjunction and as a comitative, while the
other has only one of those functions. Papiamentu is an example of such a language:
		 Papiamentu (Creole (Spanish-lexified): Netherlands Antilles)
	 (261)	 a.	 ela	 kumpra	 pan	 i	 keshi
			 3sg	 buy.pfv	 bread	 and	 cheese
			 ‘He bought bread and cheese.’
		 b.	 ela	 kumpra	 pan	 ku	 keshi
			 3sg	 buy.pfv	 bread	 with/and	 cheese
			 ‘He bought a cheese sandwich.’ Or: ‘He bought bread and cheese.’
 (Muller 1989:â•›472)
The coordinator i in (261a) can only function as a conjunction (‘and’), while the mark-
er ku ‘with/and’ in (261b) may function both as a comitative (‘with’) and as a conjunc-
tion (‘and’).
11.1.2.1â•‡ Monosyndetic coordination
In monosyndetic coordination we have only one overt linking device. There are four
logical possibilities for monosyndetic coordination: prepositive with the coordinator
preceding the first unit (co(-)A B); prepositive with the coordinator preceding the
second unit (A co(-)B, also called medial prepositive); postpositive with the coordina-
tor following the first unit (A(-)co B, also called medial postpositive); and postpositive
with the coordinator following the second unit (A B(-)co).
The most common strategy for coordination is A co(-)B, i.e. where the coordina-
tor precedes the second coordinated unit (cf. Stassen 2000, who terms this strategy
medial monosyndeton). English is an example of such a language; one indicator for
the fact that the coordinator groups with the second unit in a phrase like John and
Peter is prosody. If we make a pause between the two units, that pause tends to come
before the coordinator (compare John… and Peter with ??John and… Peter). Another
indicator is where the coordinator ends up if the two units get separated: compare
John will come to the party, and Peter if he can make it with *John and will come to the
party, Peter if he can make it.
Postpositive monosyndetic coordination is cross-linguistically rather rare (StassenÂ�
2011). An example of the A(-)co B strategy, i.e. where the coordinator follows the first
unit, can be found in Lezgian:
312	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Lezgian (Nakh-Daghestanian (Lezgic): Russia)
	 (262)	 Ali.di-ni-ni	 Weli.di-n	 buba
		 PN-gen-and	 PN-gen	 father
		 ‘Ali’s and Weli’s father’  (Haspelmath 1993:â•›327)
In (262) the coordinating suffix â•‚ni ‘and’ attaches to the first of the two coordinated
units.172 An example of the A B(-)co strategy, i.e. where the coordinator follows the
second unit, can be found in Pitjantjatjara:
		 Pitjantjatjara (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia)
	 (263)	 Henry-ku	 mama	 ngunytju	 puru
		 PN-gen	 mother	 father	 and
		 ‘Henry’s father and mother’  (Stassen 2000:â•›15 citing Glass & Hackett 1970:â•›66)
In (263) the coordinator puru ‘and’ follows the second of the two coordinated units.
The fourth logical possibility, co(-)A B, i.e. where the coordinator precedes the
first of the two coordinated elements, is not currently known to exist (at least not for
conjunctions).
11.1.2.2â•‡ Bisyndetic coordination
With bisyndetic coordination there are also four logical possible strategies: that both
coordinators are prepositive (co(-)A co(-)B), that both coordinators are postpositive
(A(-)co B(-)co) or that the coordinators are mixed with respect to position (either
co(-)A B(-)co or A(-)co co(-)B). All four types are attested, but not all are the default
strategy for coordination. Prepositive bisyndetic coordination (co(-)A co(-)B), for ex-
ample, only occurs in Stassen’s (2000) sample of 260 languages as an emphatic alter-
native to the prepositive monosyndetic coordination, such as in French:
		 French (Indo-European (Romance): France)
	 (264)	 a.	 Pierre	 et	 Sophia
			 PN	 and	 PN
			 ‘Pierre and Sophia’
		 b.	 et	 Pierre	 et	 Sophia
			 and	 PN	 and	 PN
			 ‘both Pierre and Sophia’  (source: personal knowledge)
172.â•‡ Lezgian also has the conjunction wa ‘and’, recently borrowed from Turkish:
		 šeher-r.i-n	 wa	 xür-er.i-n	 zehmetči-jar
		 town-pl-gen	 and	 village-pl-gen	 worker-pl
		 ‘the working people of towns and villages’  (Haspelmath 1993:â•›330)
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 313
The usual strategy for coordinating NPs in French is the prepositive coordinator et
‘and’ (Example (264a)). In order to achieve an emphatic coordination (‘both … and’),
the coordinator is used twice and thus becomes a bisyndetic prepositive coordination
(Example (264b)).
Postpositive bisyndetic coordination (A(-)co B(-)co) is common in the Cauca-
sus, North-Eastern Africa, Southern India, Papua New Guinea and Australia (Stassen
2000). Dargwa is an example of a language with postpositive bisyndetic coordination:
		 Dargwa (Nakh-Daghestanian (Lak-Dargwa): Russia)
	 (265)	 dudeš.li-ra	 neš.li-ra	 emħe	 b-abg-ili	 sa<b>i
		 father.erg-and	 mother.erg-and	 donkey.abs	 n-harness-ger	 be:hpl
		 ‘Father and mother harnessed the donkey.’  (van den Berg 2004:â•›199)
In (265) the conjunctive marker â•‚ra ‘and’ suffixes to both units that are coordinated.
Mixed bisyndetic coordination is an extremely rare strategy (Haspelmath 2007:
10). Examples can be found in Latin and Homeric Greek:
		 Latin (Indo-European (Italic): present-day Italy)
	 (266)	 et	 singulis	 universis-que
		 and	 individuals	 universal-and
		 ‘both for individuals and for all together’  (Haspelmath 2007:â•›11)
		 Homeric Greek (Indo-European (Greek): present-day Greece & E Mediterranean)
	 (267)	 Atreídēs	 te	 kaì	 Akhilles
		 PN’s.son	 and	 and	 PN
		 ‘Atreu’s son and Achilles’  (Haspelmath 2007:â•›11)
In (266) we have a mixed bisyndetic coordination of the co(-)A B(-)co type. Notice
that this is an emphatic coordination (‘both… and’) and that the unmarked conjunc-
tive coordination for Latin is with the monosyndetic clitic â•‚que. In (267) we have a
mixed bisyndetic coordination of the A(-)co co(-)B type. Notice, furthermore, that in
both cases the coordinators are two different markers.
11.1.2.3â•‡ Multiple coordination
In principle we may have an unlimited amount of units that get coordinated. It is com-
mon for languages to allow coordinator omission when more than two units are co-
ordinated. In English, for example, coordinator omission is preferred: compare John,
Mary, Peter and Lucy all came to the party with John and Mary and Peter and Lucy all
came to the party. Retaining the coordinator between each unit makes for an emphatic
kind of reading that is normally only used in special contexts. In English all but the last
coordinator is omitted, as seems to be the most common strategy. However, there are
languages where all but the first coordinator is omitted, such as Classical Tibetan.
314	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Classical Tibetan (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): present-day Tibet)
	 (268)	 a.	 sa-dan̄	 tšhu-dan̄	 me-dan̄	 rlun̄
			 earth-and	 water-and	 fire-and	 air
			 ‘earth and water and fire and air’
		 b.	 sa-dan̄	 tšhu	 me	 rlun̄
			 earth-and	 water	 fire	 air
			 ‘earth, water, fire and air’  (Beyer 1992:â•›241)
In (268a) the coordinator â•‚dan̄ ‘and’ is retained between each of the coordinated units,
while in (268b) all but the first are omitted.
Not all languages allow coordinator omission. Sonsorol-Tobi, for example, re-
quires a coordinator between each of the conjoined units:
		 Sonsorol-Tobi (Austronesian (Oceanic): Palau)
	 (269)	 Tekina	 ma	 Nninuo	 ma	 Yosio	 ma	 Kino	 le	 kae
		 PN	 and	 PN	 and	 PN	 and	 PN	 they	 often
		 pwi-wow	 dei-nako
		 go-dirc		 fish-dirc
		 ‘Tekina, Nninuo, Yosio, Kino often went out fishing.’  (Oda 1977:â•›59)
In (269) the coordinator ma ‘and’ has to be placed between each of the conjoined NPs;
something like *Tekina, Nninuo, Yosio ma Kino, with all but one of the coordinators
omitted, would not be acceptable in Sonsorol-Tobi (Oda 1977:â•›59).
11.1.3		 Ellipsis
When clauses are coordinated this often means that some material is repeated, as
in Mary baked the cake and John ate the cake (where the NP [the cake] is repeated).
Many languages allow ellipsis (also called coordination reduction or clause reduc-
tion) where all but one occurrence of the repeated material is deleted, as in Mary
baked _____ and John ate the cake (where the first occurrence of the NP [the cake] is
deleted).173
Ellipsis can be either forward or backward. Forward ellipsis, or analipsis, is when
the second of the coordinated units gets deleted:
	 (270)	 Mary bought a dress and John ____ a hat.
In (270) what would have been the second occurrence of the verb bought is delet-
ed. This is also often called gapping, since in many European languages the most
173.â•‡ In English this represents rather formal language. The informal equivalent would be something
like Mary baked the cake and John ate it, where an anaphoric pronoun fills the slot of the deleted NP.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 315
Â�
common form of analipsis is deletion of the repeated verb, which then leaves a gap
between the preverbal and postverbal constituents (John ____ a hat).
Backward ellipsis, or catalipsis, is when the first occurrence of the repeated mate-
rial gets deleted:
	 (271)	 Mary loves ____ and John hates romantic comedies.
In (271) what would have been the first instance of the repeated NP romantic comedies
is deleted. Here it is the last element of the first coordinated clause that gets deleted
(in this case the direct object romantic comedies); this is also called right periphery
ellipsis.
11.2	 Subordination
A subordinated (or dependent) clause is a clause that functions as a constituent, i.e. is
embedded, within a main (or superordinate) clause. In Mary said that she was going
to take the bus, for example, the full clause [that she was going to take the bus] func-
tions as the object of the verb said. In other words, one of the arguments (in this case
the object) is a full clause. Likewise a clause can function as an adjunct of a clause, as
in Mary will take the bus after she has finished packing her bag, where the full clause
[after she has finished packing her bag] functions as an adverbial. Full clauses may also
function as modifiers of phrases, as in Mary will pack the bag which John gave her for
Christmas where the clause [which John gave her for Christmas] functions as a modi-
fier of the NP the bag, much as an adjective might (compare Mary will pack the big bag
where the adjective big modifies the NP (the) bag).
The term matrix clause is sometimes used to denote a main clause. However it
makes sense to distinguish between the two types of clauses. Following Quirk et al.
(1985), I will here use the term main clause to denote an independent clause, i.e. a
clause that is fully formed and functional on its own. Examples of main clauses are
Mary saw John, Mary told John that she saw him, Mary saw John as he got out of the bus,
Mary saw the man who helped John get out of the bus, and so on. I will, again following
Quirk et al. (1985), use the term matrix clause to denote a clause which contains an
embedded subordinate clause, i.e. where a subordinate clause functions as a constitu-
ent. That is, a matrix clause is a main (or superordinate) clause minus its subordinate
clause part (Quirk et al. 1985:â•›991). Examples of matrix clauses are (underlined) Mary
told John that she saw him, Mary saw John as he got out of the bus, and so on. In other
words, a matrix clause is one which always carries a subordinate clause as one of its
constituents. While a main clause is always independent, a matrix clause may or may
not be independent. For instance, while Mary saw John functions on its own, *Mary
told John does not (since we lack the direct object of the verb told).
316	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In this section I will define and give examples of complement clauses, adverbial
clauses and relative clauses. The discussion will by necessity only scratch the surface
of the complex issues related to subordinate clauses. For a very detailed analysis of
subordination, including large cross-linguistic surveys, see Cristofaro (2005).
11.2.1		 Complement clauses
A complement clause is a clause that functions as an argument of its matrix clause.
This means that the matrix clause is incomplete without its embedded subordinate
clause, since an argument constitutes an obligatory participant. A subject comple-
ment is a clause that functions as the subject of its matrix clause, as in That the ball
landed on his head startled the sleeping dog, where the clause [That the ball landed on
his head] functions as a subject to the verb startled. English usually postposes a subject
complement and fills the subject slot with the pronoun it: It startled the sleeping dog
that the ball landed on his head. An object complement is a clause that functions as
the object of its matrix, such as The sleeping dog dreamt that a ball landed on his head,
where the clause [that a ball landed on his head] functions as an object to the verb
dreamt. A sentence can have several complement clauses embedded in each other:
	 (272)	 The dog hoped [that his master would realize [that it was time for dinner]].
In (272) the object complement [that his master would realize] in turn functions as a
matrix for the object complement [that it was time for dinner].
Languages often have complementizers, that is, overt markers to signal that an
entity is a complement clause. This may also be thought of as a subordinating particle,
since the complementizer is flagging that the clause is subordinated to a matrix. The
English complementizer is that, as in The dog wished that he would get his food soon,
where that signals that the clause [he would get his food soon] is subordinated to the
matrix The dog wished____.174
Complement clauses can be finite or non-finite. The former are more indepen-
dent, or sentence-like (sometimes termed s-like) in that the complement clause looks
similar in form to what it would have as an independent clause without the comple-
mentizer. The latter, non-finite complements, are less independent and do not look
similar in form to a main clause.
The following will give some examples of different types of finite and non-finite
complement clauses. It is by no means a comprehensive discussion of complementa-
tion. For a detailed and accessible overview of complementation from a typologi-
cal perspective, see Noonan (2007), which this section relies heavily on. Dixon &
174.â•‡ But see Noonan (2007) where if and to are also considered complementizers, as in I don’t know
if he will come tomorrow and Jane wants Peter to invite her out.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 317
Â�
Aikhenvald (2006) gives not only very accessible general information on complemen-
tation, but also presents a collection of studies on complement clauses in different
languages.
11.2.1.1â•‡ Finite complements
With finite complements the verb is typically finite in that it carries its own TMA in-
flection (and whatever necessary agreement), the subject is typically directly expressed
(i.e. need not be the same as the one in the matrix clause), and the case marking of the
arguments will typically be the same as in a main clause.175 In short, the complement
clause is sentence-like (s-like) in that it looks very similar in form to what it would
have if it had been a main clause. An example of an English finite complement would
be Robert said that the new teacher sings very well, where the complement clause [that
the new teacher sings very well] could function as an independent (or main) clause
without its complementizer that. The form of the elements in a complement clause
may be similar to or the same as the form of the elements in a main clause, even
though the constituent order changes. In German, for example, complements may be
s-like morphologically but the word order for the subordinate clause goes from SVO
to SOV:
		 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
	 (273)	 a.	 Der	 Mann	 sieht	 einen	 Film
			 art.m.nom	 man.nom	 watch.3sg.pres	 art.m.acc	 film
			 S		 V	 O
			 ‘The man is watching a film.’
		 b.	 Ich	 glaube,
			 1sg	 think.1sg.pres
			 matrix clause
			 dass	 der	 Mann	 einen	 Film	 sieht
			 compl	 art.m.nom	 man	 art.m.acc	 film	 watch.3sg.pres
					 S		 O	 V
			 complement clause
			 ‘I think that the man is watching a film.’  (source: personal knowledge)
The complement clause of (273b) is s-like in that the form of the verb as well as of
the arguments is the same as it would have been in a main clause (as in (273a)). The
difference is only that the complementizer dass ‘that’ governs a verb final word order.
Some languages do not have any complementizer to flag that a clause is a com-
plement clause, but the subordinate clause is simply juxtaposed. This is also called
175.â•‡ But see Dixon (2006b:â•›45) for a discussion on why finite is a term that should be avoided.
318	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
parataxis or apposition. In Mualang, for example, the complement clause is finite and
only prosody sets it off as a separate unit from the matrix clause:
		 Mualang (Austronesian (Malayic): Indonesia)
	 (274)	 ku	 N-dinga	 [ia	 udah	 datay]
		 1sg	 actv-hear	 3sg	 pfct	 come
		 S	 V	 O
		 matrix clause	 [complement clause]
		 ‘I heard [(that) he has come].’  (Tjia 2007:â•›274)
In (274) the object of the matrix clause is the entire complement clause ia udah datay
‘he has come’. There is no complementizer to flag the complement clause; only intona-
tion sets the complement clause off as a subordinate to the matrix ku Ndinga ‘I heard’.
11.2.1.2â•‡ Non-finite complements
Non-finite complements are less independent and typically are not formally similar
to a main clause. The verb is typically not inflected for its own TMA and often the sub-
ject of the complement clause must be identical with that of the matrix clause. An ex-
ample of a non-finite complement clause would be Mary likes to play with dogs, where
the infinitival complement clause [to play with dogs] functions as an object to the
verb likes. Notice that the complement clause could not function as an independent
sentence (*To play with dogs does not constitute a complete clause). Similarly, in Mary
enjoys playing with dogs, the participial complement clause [playing with dogs] func-
tions as an object and is incomplete as an independent clause (*Playing with dogs). In
both these example sentences the subject of the complement clause is the same as in
the matrix clause: it is Mary who likes something and it is Mary who plays with dogs.
Sentences like *Mary likes John to play with dogs or *Mary enjoys John playing with
dogs, where the matrix and the non-finite complement clauses have different subjects,
would not be acceptable.
In infinitive complements the verb of the complement clause is in its infinitive
form and carries no syntactic relation to its notional subject (Noonan 2007:â•›67). In
other words, there is no TMA or agreement marking on the verb. An example of an
infinitive complement is Mary tried to learn the poem, where the verb of the comple-
ment clause [to learn the poem] is in its infinitival form (to learn). Even if the verb is
in the infinitive and does not take any TMA or agreement marking, it still notionally
is a verb (and not, for example, a nominalization). This can, for instance, be seen in
the relation between the verb and the object in the complement clause. In English
little more than the word order can tell us anything in that matter (but notice that the
object occupies its usual slot, after the verb), but in other languages case marking on
the object remains the same as it would have in a main clause:
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 319
		 Hungarian (Uralic (Ugric): Hungary)
	 (275)	 Anna	 meg-próbál-t-a	 meg-tanul-ni	 a	 vesset
		 PN	 pfx-try-past-def	 pfx-learn-inf	 the	 poem.acc
		 ‘Anna tried to learn the poem.’  (Kenesei et al. 1998:â•›33)
In (275) the infinitive complement (underlined) has its verb in the infinitive (marked
by the suffix â•‚ni) with no tense or agreement marker, as opposed to the verb in the
matrix clause. The object in the complement clause is inflected for the accusative case,
as it would have been in a main clause.
In nominalized complements the verb is made to function as a noun (it is
nominalized), is the head noun of the NP and may take articles and case marking,
may combine with adpositions and may in some cases be pluralized. An example
of a nominalized complement clause is The king’s deer hunting gave entertainment
to the whole court, where the nominalized verb deer hunting functions as the head
of the NP [the king’s deer hunting], which in turn functions as the subject of the
matrix clause.
Some languages allow various kinds of verbal marking on the nominalized verb.
In Jamul Tiipay the nominalized verb takes the irrealis marker:
		 Jamul Tiipay (Hokan (Yuman): USA)
	 (276)	 [puu-ch	 w-yiw-x]-pu	 yaylly+pit
		 [that.one-S	 3-come-irr]-dem	 forget
		 ‘I forgot (that) he was going to come.’  (Miller 2001:â•›224)
In (276) the complement clause (in square brackets) functions as an NP, as evi-
denced by the demonstrative marker â•‚pu, which attaches to the verbal noun wyiwx-.
Even though the verb functions as a verbal noun, it takes the irrealis marker â•‚x. The
entire nominalized complement clause functions as the object of the matrix yayl-
lypit ‘(I) forgot’.
Participial complements are somewhat different from other complement clauses
in that syntactically they function as modifiers rather than as constituents. In other
words, they function as adjectives or adverbs. An example of a participial comple-
ment is I smelled Mary baking a cake, with the verb in its participial form (baking).
Here Mary functions as the object of the matrix and as the subject of the complement
clause. The participle baking (a cake) functions as an adjective to the NP Mary. The
modifying nature of the complement is, however, only syntactic and not semantic; it
is the whole event and not only the argument that functions as the object of the matrix
(Mary) that is being referred to. In other words, the sentence above does not mean ‘I
smelled Mary’.
320	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
11.2.2		 Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses function as adjuncts to their matrix clauses. That is, they func-
tion as non-obligatory supplementary modifications to the verb phrase or the entire
matrix clause. The term ‘adverbial clause’ thus refers to their “adverbial” function. Ex-
amples of adverbial clauses are Mary saw John when he stepped out of the house (time),
Mary lives where the road ends (location), Fold this as I showed you (manner), Mary
phoned John because she missed him (reason), and so on.
The following will give some examples of the kinds of adverbial clauses that can be
found cross-linguistically. It is beyond the scope of this section to give a comprehen-
sive discussion on adverbial clauses as a linguistic phenomenon. This section relies
mainly on Thompson et al. (2007), which is a very accessible overview of adverbial
clauses cross-linguistically. But see also Kortmann (1997) for a typology of adverbial
clauses in the languages of Europe, including a discussion on the grammaticalization
of adverbial clause subordinators in English, and van der Auwera (1998) for a col-
lection of chapters giving various perspectives on adverbial constructions, predomi-
nantly on the languages of Europe.
Cross-linguistically adverbial clauses tend to fall into one of two groups: those
that can be replaced with a single word and those that cannot (Thompson et al. 2007:
243). An example of an adverbial clause that can be replaced with a single word is
Mary saw John at the bus stop, where [at the bus stop] may be replaced with, for ex-
ample, there (or any other place adverbial) to form the sentence Mary saw John there.
An adverbial clause of reason, such as because she missed him in Mary phoned John
because she missed him, is not possible to replace with a single word adverb.
It should be noted that the types of adverbial clauses listed in the following are not
claimed to be universal: a language may or may not use subordination to achieve the
function of a given adverbial clause.
11.2.2.1â•‡ Adverbial clauses that can be replaced with one word
It is very common for languages to have specific adverbs expressing time, location
and manner. Therefore, adverbial clauses that function as time, location or manner
adverbials can generally be replaced with a single word. Time clauses function as a
time adverbial and give information about the temporal sequence of events. This may
either be indicated by a subordinating word, as in English (for example John felt bet-
ter after he had taken a nap), or with a verbal affix. In Kamula the temporal adverbial
clause is marked with a verbal sequence affix:
		 Kamula (Trans-New Guinea (Kamula): Papua New Guinea)
	 (277)	 koa	 yu	 solo-po,	 me-tle	 heta-wa
		 canoe	 water	 throw-imm.seq	 there-abl	 go.up-fp
		 ‘After we threw the water out of the canoe, we went up(stream).’ (Routamaa 1994:â•›83)
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 321
In (277) the verbal affix â•‚po marks sequentiality and indicates that the clause serves as
a temporal adverb to its matrix.
Locative clauses function as place adverbs and are often introduced by a subordi-
nator meaning ‘where’, as in Mary sat where she always used to sit.
Manner clauses function as manner adverbs and may either be indicated by a
subordinate marker, as in Peter felt like he could fly or may take the form of a relative
clause (see below), as in Do it the way (that) I told you.
11.2.2.2â•‡ Adverbial clauses that cannot be replaced with one word
While it is very common for languages to have specific adverbs expressing time, loca-
tion and manner, it is rarely the case that languages have a specific adverb expressing
purpose, circumstance, simultaneity, substitution, and so on. Therefore, the adverbial
clauses discussed here can generally not be replaced with a single word.
A purpose clause expresses the purpose for an action. A reason (or causal) clause
explains why an action or event took place. The difference between purpose and rea-
son clauses is that “purpose clauses express a motivating event which must be unreal-
ized at the time of the main event, while reason clauses express a motivating event
which may be realized at the time of the main event” (Thompson et al. 2007:â•›251, em-
phasis in original). Consider the difference between the following sentences:
	 (278)	 a.	 He went out to get groceries.
		 b.	 He had a snack because he was hungry.
In (278a) the adverbial clause [to get groceries] explains why he went out, but the gro-
ceries had not been bought at the time he went out. The purpose for the action is thus
still unrealized at the time of the main event. In (278b) the adverbial clause [because
he was hungry] explains why he had a snack. His hunger was a real fact at the time he
carried out the main event (had a snack). The explanation for the main event is thus a
realized motivating event. Th unrealized nature of purpose clauses as in (278a) is often
captured in the verbal morphology of the subordinate clauses. In Alacatlatzala Mix-
tec, for example, the subordinate verb in a purpose clause must be in the potential:
		 Alacatlatzala Mixtec (Oto-Manguean (Mixtecan): Mexico)
	 (279)	 a.	 ñā	 kihví	 kísā	 ún
			 it.inan	 stupid	 cont.do	 you.sg
			 chī	 sini	 ún	 kúmánī
			 because	 head	 your.sg	 cont.lack
			 ‘You do stupid things because you lack sense.’
		 b.	 vashī	 rā	 ñā	 chīndēé	 rā	 ndihi
			 cont.come	 he	 comp	 pot.help	 he	 us.excl
			 ‘He is coming (in order) to help us.’  (Zylstra 1991:â•›142,â•›146)
322	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (279a) we have a reason clause marked with the subordinator chī. The verb in the
subordinate clause (kúmanī ‘lack.continuative’) is inflected in the continuative, as
is the verb in the matrix clause. In (279b) we have a purpose clause, indicated by the
complementizer ñā and the fact that the verb in the subordinate clause is inflected in
the potential (chīndēé ‘help.potential’).
Circumstantial clauses express “the circumstances by which a given state of af-
fairs comes to be” (Thompson et al. 2007:â•›253) and seem to represent a typologically
rare type of adverbial clause (Payne 1997). An example of a circumstantial clause is
He got to the top at a young age by cheating in his work, where the adverbial clause [by
cheating in his work] states the circumstances that led to a situation described in the
matrix.
A simultaneous clause indicates that two events overlap, as in While he was jog-
ging, he got a bright idea, where the two events of jogging and getting an idea overlap.
Languages may have a specific verbal marker to denote simultaneity:
		 Mauwake (Trans-New Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (280)	 nefa	 ikum-am-ika-iwkin	 nan	 kerer-e-n
		 2sg.acc	 illicitly-SS.sim-be-2/3pl.DS	 there	 appear-pa-2sg
		 ‘They were just speculating about you when you arrived.’  (Berghäll 2010:â•›121)
In (280) the same-subject simultaneous verbal marker â•‚amâ•‚ indicates that the two
events of the speculation and the appearing overlap.
Conditional clauses can be divided into two basic semantic types, those that de-
note real conditions (reality conditional) and those that denote unreal conditions
(unreality conditionals). Examples of reality conditionals are If that milk is boiling,
(then) you’ve kept it on the stove for too long (present situation), If you set an alarm
clock, (then) it rings at the given time (habitual/generic), If you saw the film, then you
know how it ends (past). Unreality conditionals may be further divided into predictive
situations (such as If he comes today, (then) we’ll have a party) and imaginative situa-
tions. Imaginative situations may be of two kinds, hypothetical (If I were rich, (then)
I’d build a castle) and counterfactual (If you had read the news, (then) you’d know what
I’m referring to). The matrix of conditional clauses (the “then clause”), is sometimes
called the apodosis, while the subordinate, the condition itself (the “if clause”), is
sometimes called the protasis.
Concessive clauses make a contrast between the matrix and the adverbial clause.
Examples of concessive clauses are Although she went to bed early, she didn’t feel rested
the next day (definite concessive clause) and Wherever she went, she felt uncomfortable
(indefinite concessive clause). The difference between the two is that indefinite con-
cessive clauses convey a tone of ‘no matter what’.

Substitutive clauses denote that an expected event is replaced with an unexpected
one, as in Henry had dinner at a restaurant instead of going home, where the adverbial
clause [instead of going home] denotes the expected event that was substituted for the
unexpected one.
Additive clauses express that one thing happened in addition to another, as in
Besides being late for their date, he was rude to her, where the adverbial clause [Besides
being late for their date] expresses what happened in addition to the event or state of
affairs expressed in the matrix.
Those adverbial clauses that basically just serve to give a general background for
the situation expressed in the matrix clause are sometimes called absolutive clauses
(Thompson et al. 2007, Payne 1997) or participial adverbial clauses (Givón 2001b).
The latter term reflects the fact that the verbs in absolutive clauses tend to be in a par-
ticipial form in English, as in Having finished the whole pot of honey, Winnie-the-Pooh
contentedly licked his paws where the adverbial clause [having finished the whole pot of
honey] serves as a general background for the situation of Pooh licking his paws. No-
tice that the verb is in a non-finite form. Because the main function of this non-finite
form is to indicate that the clause is a subordinated adverbial, the verbs in such clauses
are sometimes called converbs (see, for example, Haspelmath 1995). Some languages
use a general subordinator to mark an absolutive clause:
		 Godié (Niger-Congo (Kru): Ivory Coast)
	 (281)	 ɔ	 yi	 mɔ	 Dakpaduu´	 nʌ	 bgesi	 ɔ	 tla	 a
		 he	 came	 to	 Dakpadu	 subord	 traps	 he	 set	 recent
		 ‘Having come to Dakpadu, he set some traps.’
 (Thompson et al. 2007:â•›266 citing Marchese 1976)
In (281) the subordinator nʌ marks the clause as subordinate, with the function of
providing the background for the event in the matrix (the setting of traps). Notice that
the verb here is not in any special (non-finite) form.
11.2.3		 Relative clauses
Relative clauses are essentially clauses that modify an NP, and are sometimes also
referred to as adjective clauses. A more specific definition for relative clauses is that
they refer to clauses “narrowing the potential reference of a referring expression by
restricting the reference to those referents of which a particular proposition is true”
(Comrie & Kuteva 2011c). For instance, in the sentence I met the actor who had per-
formed the day before the matrix has the referring expression [the actor]. The relative
clause [who had performed the day before] narrows the potential referents to only the
specific actor for which the proposition in the relative clause holds true, i.e. only that
actor who had performed the day before.
324	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In English a distinction is usually made between restrictive (or defining) relative
clauses and non-restrictive (or non-defining) relative clauses. A restrictive relative
clause is one that conforms to the above definition, namely a clause which restricts
the potential referents in the matrix to those for which the proposition in the relative
clause holds true. Compare The man who sported a chequered felt hat spoke to me with
The man, who sported a chequered felt hat, spoke to me. The former sentence contains
a restrictive relative clause which indicates that out of a number of men (for instance
one wearing a cap, one wearing a black hat, one wearing a chequered felt hat, and one
not wearing any hat at all), it was the one wearing a chequered felt hat that greeted
me. Here the implication is that a sentence like The man spoke to me would not pro-
vide enough information to the hearer, making the added information [who sported
a chequered felt hat] necessary in order for the hearer to identify precisely which man
is being referred to. In the latter sentence the relative clause is non-restrictive and
purely descriptive; it only adds some information about the man, but does not involve
specifying one man out of several.
There are various formal differences between restrictive and non-restrictive rela-
tive clauses in English. One is prosody: non-restrictive relative clauses are usually set
off from the matrix clause with pauses (indicated by commas in written text). Another
is the choice of marker: non-restrictive clauses require relative pronouns, restrictive
relative clauses also allow the relativizer that (compare The man that sported a che-
quered felt hat spoke to me with *The man, that sported a chequered felt hat, spoke
to me) or a gap (compare, for example, The man ____ I spoke to yesterday came to
my house with *The man, ____ I spoke to yesterday, came to my house). While there
are other languages with formal distinctions between restrictive and non-restrictive
relative clauses, this is very rare. For most languages it is therefore irrelevant to make
a differentiation between the two types (cf. Comrie 1989:â•›139). Because of this, the
remainder of this section will deal with so-called restrictive relative clauses only, i.e.
such clauses that conform to the definition given above.
Much has been written on relative clauses in general as well as the relative claus-
es of particular languages. For very accessible overviews of the typology of relative
clauses, see Comrie (1989:â•›138ff), Givón (2001b:â•›175ff) and Andrews (2007a). A very
thorough study indeed on the typology of relative clauses is Lehmann (1984), unfor-
tunately accessible only to those who read German.
11.2.3.1â•‡ The structure of the relative clause
There are several pertinent parts to a sentence that contains a relative clause, each of
which I will briefly mention. Consider the following sentences:
	 (282)	 a.	 I know the man [who waved at us]
		 b.	 The man [that waved at us] seems familiar to me
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 325
The matrix clause is the clause in which the relative clause is embedded (I know
the man and The man seems familiar to me respectively). The head of the relative clause
is the NP that the relative clause modifies (the man in both sentences). The head of
the relative clause may also be termed NPmat since it is an NP in the matrix clause
that is being delimited by the relative clause. The restricting clause, i.e. the clause that
delimits the reference of the referring expression, is the relative clause itself. This may
also be termed Srel. The Srel will, in this section, be indicated with square brackets (as
in Example (282)). A relative clause may be flagged, or set off, by a relativizer, as in
(282b) that and an Srel may or may not contain an overt element that is coreferential
with the head (or NPmat). In (282a) there is such an overt element, a relativized NP
(or NPrel): who is an NPrel which is coreferential with the head NP (or NPmat) the man.
In (282b) there is no such coreferential element; instead there is a gap where the NPrel
would have been: The man that [____ waved at us] seems familiar to me.
It is important to notice that the head (NPmat) and the relativized NP (NPrel) do
not necessarily have to have the same syntactic roles. Compare the following:
	 (283)	 a.	 I	 know	 the man	 [who	 waved at	 us]
			 S	 V	 O	 [S	 V	 O]
		 b.	 The man	 [who(m)	 I	 waved to]	 recognized	 me
			 S	 [O	 S	 V]	 V	 O
In (283a) the NPrel (who) is the subject of the relative clause but the NPmat is the object
of the matrix clause. In (283b) the NPrel (who(m)) is the object of the relative clause
but is coreferential with the subject of the matrix.176
Languages have different strategies for representing the NPrel. We have seen that
English may leave a gap for the NPrel. The gap strategy is extremely common, spread
all over the world. Of the 166 languages in Comrie & Kuteva’s (2011b) database on
the relativization on NPrel subjects 125 (or 75.3%) have a gap. Notice that this refers to
any strategy where there is no overt element that is coreferential with the head NP.
Whether a relativizer is present or not is irrelevant:
		 Turkish (Altaic (Turkic): Turkey)
	 (284)	 [____	 balıǧ-ı	 yi-yen]	 adam
			 fish-acc	 eat-ptcpl	 man
		 ‘the man [who eats/ate the fish]’  (Kornfilt 2003:â•›58)
176.â•‡ The Srel [who(m) I waved to] exhibits the typologically rare phenomenon of preposition
stranding, where the preposition is left hanging at the end of the clause because the NPrel has been
fronted to clause initial position (compare I waved to the man, where the NP the man follows the
preposition to). It is more common for the prepositional phrase to have its conventional order of
prepositionâ•›+â•›NP, which is also possible in English, though it is more formal (the man [to whom
I waved]). The latter strategy is informally termed pied-piping. The complexities of preposition
stranding versus pied-piping will not be discussed further here.
326	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (284) there is no relativizer equivalent to the English that. The strategy is still a
gap strategy, since there is no overt reference to the head NP (adam ‘man’) in the Srel.
Notice also that even though the verb is in a non-finite form, the clause follows the
definition of a relative clause in that it serves the function of narrowing the potential
referents of the head NP.
English may also have a relative pronoun (who or whom depending on syntactic
role), i.e. a pronoun inside the Srel that is coreferential with the NPmat and that at the
same time functions as a relativizer. This strategy is found in only 12 languages (or
7.2%) for subject NPrels, all of them, except Acoma, European languages.177 A some-
what more common strategy for subject NPrels is non-reduction, where the head noun
(re)appears as a full NP in the Srel, something along the lines of The man [I waved to
the man] recognized me. This is found in 24 (or 14.5%) of the languages in Comrie and
Kuteva’s database, most of them in the Americas. The strategy non-reduction actu-
ally covers three different subtypes in Comrie & Kuteva’s database: internally headed
clauses, correlative clauses and paratactic relative clauses. In internally headed rela-
tive clauses (also called internal relative clauses) the head NP (NPmat) appears inside
the relative clause and is not represented in the matrix. Jamul Tiipay is an example of
a language with such a strategy:
		 Jamul Tiipay (Hokan (Yuman): USA)
	 (285)	 [‘iipa	 peya	 nye-kwe-‘iny]-pe-ch	 mespa
		 [man	 this	 3/1-S.rel-give]-dem-subj	 die
		 ‘The man [who gave me this] died.’  (Miller 2001:â•›207)
In (285) the head NP ‘iipa ‘man’ appears not in the matrix but in the Srel itself.
In correlative clauses the head NP also occurs inside the Srel, but as opposed to
internally headed relative clauses, the head NP in correlative clauses has an overt ref-
erence in the matrix (either anaphorically with a pronoun or with a repetition of the
head NP). Supyire is an example of a language with correlative clauses:
		 Supyire (Niger-Congo (Gur): Mali)
	 (286)	 [pùcwòyì	 u	 ɲyɛ	 ná	 mu	 í	 ke]
		 [girl.def(i.sg)	 she(i.sg)	 be	 with	 you	 with	 rel]
		 uru	 sí	 ŋ̀-kwû
		 she(emph.i.sg)	 fut	 fut-die
		 ‘The girl [who is with you] will die.’ (lit. [The girl she who is with you] she will die)
 (Carlson 1994:â•›489)
177.â•‡ English is listed in this group in Comrie & Kuteva’s (2011b) database, although it also has other
strategies.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 327
In (286) the head NP pùcwòyì ‘girl’ appears inside the Srel and is anaphorically connected
with the pronoun uru ‘she’ in the matrix. The relativizer ke marks the clause as an Srel.
A paratactic relative clause “contains the full-fledged head and is the same as
an unmarked simple (declarative) clause; the relative and main clauses are only very
loosely joined together” (Comrie & Kuteva 2011b). Amele is an example of a language
with paratactic relative clauses:
		 Amele (Trans-New Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (287)	 mel	 mala	 heje	 on
		 boy	 chicken	 illicit	 take.3sg.subj.rem.pst
		 ((mel)	 eu)	 busali	 nu-i-a
		 boy	 that	 run.away	 go-3sg.subj-tod.pst
		 ‘The boy [that stole the chicken ran away].’
 (Comrie & Kuteva 2011b citing John Roberts p.c.)
In (287) the head NP mel ‘boy’ appears in what might be termed the relative clause
(even though it is not overtly subordinate). It may optionally be repeated in what
might be termed the matrix, together with an optional determiner. Intonation indi-
cates that these are not two independent main clauses. Notice also that, unlike in the
correlative clause above, there is no relativizer of any kind.
The last strategy coded in Comrie & Kuteva (2011b) is pronoun retention. This is
very rare, found only in five languages (3%) in their sample: Babungo, Baka (Niger-
Congo (Ubangi): Cameroon), Eastern Kayah Li, Ngemba (Niger-Congo (Bantoid):
Cameroon) and Yoruba.
		 Babungo (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Cameroon)
	 (288)	 wə̀	 [ntɨ́ə	 fáŋ	 ŋwə̀	 nə̀	 sàŋ	 ghɔ̀]	 jwì		 féenə̀
		 person	 [that	 who	 he	 past4	 beat.pf	 you]	 come.pf	 here
		 ‘The man [who has beaten you] has come here.’  (Schaub 1985:â•›33)
In (288) the relative clause contains a resumptive personal pronoun (ŋwə̀ ‘he’) which
is coreferential with the head NP.
A strategy not included in Comrie & Kuteva’s map is that of headless relative
clauses (also called free relative clauses), where the head NP is lacking altogether,
such as [Whoever disturbs me now] will get a scolding, where the reference to the NPmat
is in the Srel itself (cf. Any person [who disturbs me now] will get a scolding).
Languages do not necessarily use the same relativization strategy for different
syntactic roles. In English, for example, the gap strategy is not acceptable with pos-
sessors (compare I love the dog whose ears are floppy with *I love the dog that ____ ears
are floppy). The pattern described above for relativization of NPrel subjects thus differs
somewhat from the pattern in Comrie & Kuteva’s (2011a) database on relativization of
NPrel obliques, as shown in Table 11.1:
328	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Table 11.1â•‡ Comparison between relativization strategies for subjects and obliques.
Adapted from Comrie & Kuteva (2011a and 2011b). Absolute numbers in parentheses.178
Value Subjects Obliques
1. Relative pronoun â•⁄ 7.2% (12) 11.6% (13)
2. Non-reduction 14.5% (24) 12.5% (14)
3. Pronoun retention â•⁄ 3% (5) 17.9% (20)
4. Gap 75.3% (125) 49.1% (55)
Total 166 112178
The differences in these patterns conform to the Accessibility Hierarchy of Relativ-
ization formulated by Comrie & Keenan (1977). The hierarchy captures the general
cross-linguistic pattern that subjects are more likely to be relativized than objects,
which are in turn more likely to be relativized than possessives.179 Put differently, the
further to the left on the hierarchy, the easier it is for that position to be relativized.
subject > direct object > indirect object > oblique > possessor
Figure 11.1â•‡ The Accessibility Hierarchy of Relativization.
The hierarchy postulates that subjects are the easiest to relativize. It further postulates
that if a language allows relativization on direct objects, it will also allow relativization
on subjects, and if a language allows relativization on indirect objects, it will also allow
relativization on direct objects and subjects, and so on. Moreover, it generalizes that
explicitness increases further down the hierarchy, so that the least explicit (or overt)
strategy is more likely to be found further to the left and the more explicit (or overt)
strategies are likely to be found further to the right. This is borne out by Comrie &
Kuteva’s databases, since the gap strategy is more common with subjects than with
obliques, while pronoun retention, which is a more explicit strategy, is more common
with obliques than with subjects.
11.2.3.2â•‡ The position of the relative clause
We have seen that relative clauses can be either internally headed or externally head-
ed. It is vastly more common to have externally headed relative clauses than internally
headed ones. Of the 825 languages in Dryer’s (2011p) database on the order of the
178.â•‡ There is a fifth value ‘not possible’ in Comrie & Kuteva (2011a) containing ten languages (8.9%
of the sample).
179.â•‡ This of course presupposes that all languages have identifiable categories such as ‘subject’ and
‘(direct/indirect) object’. For a discussion on why those categories are not universal, see, for example,
Andrews (2007b) and LaPolla & Poa (2006).
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 329
Â�
relative clause and head NP, only 24 (or 2.9%) are internally headed. Eight languag-
es (1%) have adjoined relative clauses while seven languages (0.8%) have correlative
relative clauses and only one language (0.1%), Kombai (Trans-New Guinea (Awju-
Dumut): Indonesia), is listed as having ‘double-headed’ relative clauses.180 In contrast,
a full 721 languages (or 87.4%) have externally headed relative clauses. The remaining
64 languages (7.8%) have a mixed system.
The externally headed relative clauses can be divided into two groups, those where
the relative clause follows the head NP (postnominal relative clauses, or NRel for the
order (head) noun-relative clause), and those where the relative clause precedes the
head NP (prenominal relative clauses or RelN for the order relative clause-(head)
noun). The former type, NRel, is by far the most common type, with 580 languages
(80.4% of the languages with externally headed relative clauses or 70.3% of the entire
sample), while RelN is found in 141 languages (19.6% of the languages with externally
headed relative clauses or 17.1% of the entire sample) in Dryer’s database. English is an
example of a language with a predominantly NRel order (The manN [who wore a felt
hat]Rel) while Evenki is an example of a language with RelN as its dominant strategy:
		 Evenki (Altaic (Tungusic): Russia)
	 (289)	 bi	 [tatkit-tu	 haval-d’a-cha-ve]Rel	 beje-veN	 archa-Ø-m
		 I	 [school-dat	 work-ipfv-ptcpl-accd]	 man-accd	 meet-nfut-1sg
		 ‘I met the man [who worked at school].’  (Nedjalkov 1997:â•›36)
In (289) the Srel precedes the head NP beje ‘man’. Turkish is another example of a
language with RelN as its dominant strategy; cf. Example (284). Languages with NRel
order are spread all over the world, while languages with RelN as their dominant strat-
egy are found predominantly in Asia (except for Southeast Asia and the Middle East).
Taking out the contact languages (Ndyuka and Sango, both with externally head-
ed relative clauses and NRel order) does not affect the pattern for the WALS languages
noticeably. While the figures for the languages in APiCS are at the time of writing still
temporary for this feature, it seems that the pattern for the order of the relative clause
and noun differs somewhat from that in WALS (Michaelis et al. 2013: feature 7). The
absolute majority of the sample has NRel as the dominant strategy while only very few
180.â•‡ What Dryer terms ‘double headed relative clauses’ is essentially the same thing as correla-
tives except that the full head NP is repeated in the relative clause. In adjoined relative clauses the
Srel appears outside the NPmat and may be separate from it. The head NP is in the matrix and is not
anaphorically referred to in the Srel:
	 Martuthunira (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia)
	 ngayu	 nhawu-ngu-layi	 kanyara-lu	 [jalyuru-ma-rnura-lu]
	 1sg.nom	 see-pass-fut	 man-fut	 [hole-caus-pres.rel-eff]
	 ‘I'll be seen by the man [who is digging a hole].’  (Dench 1995:â•›244)
330	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
languages seem to have RelN as their dominant strategy. In other words, externally
headed relative clauses seem even more common for the languages in the APiCS than
for those in WALS.
animacy dependent relative clause markers
In English the choice of relative pronoun who(m)/which agrees with the animacy of the head
NP, as in Themanwhogreetedme (but not *Themanwhichgreetedme) and Thestonewhichfell
(but not *The stone who fell). This is quite rare cross-linguistically. In a survey of 275 languages
I found that 108 had some kind of relative clause marker (grey squares). Of these, the relative
clause marker was animacy dependent in only 13 languages (black triangles). White dots on
the map indicate languages that form relative clauses by other means than with a relative
clause marker. For a full legend, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/z.176.additional.
The English animacy dependency is not inherited: other Germanic languages either have an
invariant marker or have gender dependent relative pronouns. Swedish, for example, has an
invariant marker, while German has gender dependent relative pronouns:
Swedish (Indo-European (Germanic): Sweden)	 German (Indo-European (Germanic): Germany)
flickan	 [som	 vinka-de]	 das	 Mädchen	 [das	 wink-te]
girl.def	 [rel	 wave-past]	 art.n.nom	 girl	 [relp.n.nom	 wave-past]
‘The girl [who waved]’	 ‘The girl [who waved]’
stenen	 [som föll]	 der	 Stein	 [der	 fiel]
stone.def	 [rel	 fall.past]	 art.m.nom	 stone	 [relp.m.nom	 fall.past]
‘The stone [which fell].’(source: own knowledge)	 ‘The stone [which fell].’(source: own knowledge)
In Swedish the relative marker is the same irrespective of the semantics of the head NP. In
German the relative pronoun agrees with the head NP in gender and number. Notice that the
gender is not animacy dependent: Mädchen ‘girl’ (human) is in the neuter while Stein ‘stone’
(inanimate) is in the masculine gender.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 331
The order of the relative clause and noun forms a unidirectional correlation with the
order of object and verb. Of the 879 languages in Dryer’s (2011z) database on the
relationship between the order of the object and verb and the order of the relative
clause and noun, 245 languages have OV word order. Of these, 132 (53.9% of the OV
languages) have the order RelN, while 113 (46.1% of the OV languages) have the order
NRel. There is no significant correlation here. However, of the 421 languages with the
order VO a full 370 (87.8% of the VO languages) have the order NRel while only five
(1.2% of the VO languages), Amis (Austronesian (Paiwanic): Taiwan), Bai, Cantonese,
Hakka and Mandarin, have the order RelN. We may thus make the unidirectional
implicational statement that if a language is VO, then it is likely to be NRel.181
11.3	 Cosubordination
The term cosubordination was originally coined by Michael Olson (1981) to describe
a type of complex clause in Barai (Trans-New-Guinea (Koiarian): Papua New Guinea)
that had similarities with both coordination and subordination. Since then the term
has mostly been used in the Role and Reference Grammar approach of linguistic anal-
ysis (cf. Foley & Van Valin 1984 and, for example, Van Valin 2005, with references).182
It is a convenient term that neatly captures the essence of the kinds of complex clauses
that are not embedded (which makes them similar to coordinated clauses) but are
also not independent (which makes them similar to subordinate clauses). The dif-
ference between coordinate, subordinate and cosubordinate clauses are illustrated in
Figure 11.2 (from Van Valin 2005:â•›188):

description and theory in its linguistic analysis. For a detailed and recent book length introduction

raphy, as well as a generous list of downloadable works, see the RRG page: http://linguistics.buffalo.

332	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
As Figure 11.2 illustrates, the essence of coordinated clauses is that no unit is em-
bedded in any other and each may function independently as a main clause. This is
indicated by the separate boxes for each of Unit 1 and Unit 2, which are then linked
together with some kind of coordination (the “+” in the figure). With subordination,
on the other hand, the subordinated clause is embedded in the matrix: Unit 1 in Fig-
ure 11.2 is embedded in Unit 2. With cosubordination, on the other hand, none of the
units is embedded in the other. However, they are also not separate from each other;
they are not two independent units, as indicated by the fusion of the two boxes.
This section will briefly define and give examples of serial verb constructions and
clause chaining, two major types of cosubordination. Each of these constructions is
highly complex and deserves much more space for discussion than this section is able
to provide.
11.3.1		 Serial verb constructions
A serial verb construction (also simply called serial verbs) is “a sequence of verbs
which act together as a single predicate, without any overt marker of coordination,
subordination, or syntactic dependency of any other sort. Serial verb constructions
describe what is conceptualized as a single event” (Aikhenvald 2006c:â•›1). In other
words, a series of two or more verbs, which are not compounded and do not belong
to separate clauses, are stringed together to describe one event. English does not have
serial verb constructions; the closest examples would be certain kinds of commands
in colloquial English (especially in American English) such as Run go fetch the ball!,
where [run go fetch] jointly serve as the predicate of the clause. Here the command is
not that the addressee should first run, then go and then fetch something. The com-
mand is about fetching the ball, and the construction conveys a sense of both urgency
and motion, something to the effect of “off you go, fetch the ball and do it now”.
Serial verb constructions are quite common cross-linguistically and are especially
prominent in West Africa, Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea, among the languages
of Amazonia and among Oceanic languages. Roughly half of the languages in APiCS
have serial verb constructions (Michaelis et al. 2013: features 84–86), indicating that
they are also common for pidgins and creoles.
This section will give some examples of the most prototypical characteristics of
serial verb constructions. I stress that these characteristics are meant only as proto-
typical characteristics. Individual languages will have various kinds of serial verb con-
structions where the given characteristics hold to a higher or lesser degree. For an
accessible introduction to the typology of serial verb constructions, see Aikhenvald
(2006c), which serves as the introduction to Aikhenvald & Dixon (2006b), where ex-
amples and discussions of serial verb constructions in a number of diverse languages
can be found. A shorter and very accessible survey of serial verb constructions, in-
cluding their developmental processes, is Bisang (2009).
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 333
Prototypical serial verb constructions refer to one single event. Consider the fol-
lowing example:
		 Loniu (Austronesian (Oceanic): Papua New Guinea)
	 (290)	 u	 pin	 imon	 ime	 amat
		 1du	 r.nsg.change	 r3sg.return	 r3sg.come	 human
		 ‘We (two) changed back into human form.’  (Hamel 1993:â•›124)
In (290) the serial verb construction denotes one single event, the changing back (into
a certain shape); a translation like ‘we changed (and then) we returned (and then) we
came’ would be incorrect.
Serial verb constructions typically form a single clause, which means that they do
not take overt markers of syntactic dependency, such as coordinating or subordinat-
ing particles. In Logba, for example, a serial verb construction takes the person agree-
ment marker only on the first verb and allows no overt linkers. The event denotes one
single time frame, meaning that we have one event which is the sum of the semantics
denoted in the verbs:
		 Logba (Niger-Congo (Kwa): Ghana)
	 (291)	 a.	 selorm	 ó-huitɛ	 bá	 a-fán
			 PN	 sm.sg-run	 come	 cm-house
			 ‘Selorm ran home.’
		 b.	 selorm	 ó-huitɛ	 yɛ	 ɔ-bá	 a-fán
			 PN	 sm.sg-run	 conj	 3sg-come	 cm-house
			 ‘Selorm ran and (then) came home.’  (Dorvlo 2008:â•›193)
In (291a) we have one single clause denoting the single action of Selorm running
home. Notice that the verbal agreement marker occurs only once, on the first verb. In
(291b) we have two coordinated clauses, as indicated by the coordinating conjunction
yɛ ‘and’. This construction conveys a meaning of sequentiality involving two separate
actions, that of running and that of coming home: “[i]ndeed it gives the impression
that the man engaged in a race and after that he came home” (Dorvlo 2008:â•›193).
Notice that here the predicates of each clause get separate verb agreement markers,
another indicator that the verbs in (291b) belong to one clause each and do not func-
tion as a single predicate in a single clause.
Serial verb constructions typically share grammatical categories such as TMA,
negation or person agreement (as in Logba in (291) above) and typically share at
least one argument in the clause. In some languages the TMA marker can only occur
once for the entire construction, as in Example (292) below, while in other languages
the TMA marking is repeated for each of the verbs of the construction, as in Exam-
ple (290) above. Note, however, that in languages where the TMA marking is repeat-
ed, the individual verbs typically need to have the same TMA (i.e., to have some of
the verbs in realis and some in irrealis mood in (290) above would not be acceptable).
334	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Lokạạ (Niger-Congo (Cross River): Niger)

		 PN	 fut	 i.agr-fetch	 xiii-water	 i.agr-put	 in	 basin
		 ‘Ubi will fetch water and put it in the basin.’  (Baker 2005:â•›133)
In (292) the future marker nạ̀ may only occur once as its scope covers both verbs of
the construction (ọ́kọ́bí ‘fetch’ and ógạnạ ‘put’ respectively); something like *úbi nạ̀
ọ́kọ́bí lòwí nạ̀ ógạnạ kạ́ gbángbán, where the future marker is repeated for each verb,
would not be acceptable.183 We also see in Example (292) that the two verbs share ar-
guments: Úbi is the subject of both verbs and lòwi ‘water’ is the object of both verbs.
Serial verbs typically behave as one single predicate, in that, for example, nomi-
nalizing or relativizing markers appear only once:
		 Toqabaqita (Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands)
	 (293)	 kwaqe	 fole-la-na	 niu	 qe	 aqi	 si	 qafetaqi
		 hit	 split-nzr-3pl	 coconut	 3sg.nfut	 neg.v	 3sg.neg	 be.difficult
		 ‘Splitting coconuts is not difficult.’  (Lichtenberk 2006:â•›261)
In (293) the nominalizing suffix appears only on the last of the verbs in the serial
verb construction, but its scope covers the entire construction (as does the 3rd person
marker), showing that the construction functions as one single predicate. The closest
English equivalent would be something like “hit-splitting coconuts is not difficult”.
Furthermore, serial verbs typically form one intonational unit, that is, they do not
have pauses between the individual verbs of the construction, which again makes
them similar to monoverbal clauses (i.e. clauses with only one verb). In Toqabaqita,
for example, the serial verb constructions behave like one unitary word and are ut-
tered in one intonation contour (Lichtenberk 2006:â•›262).
11.3.2		 Clause chaining
A second type of cosubordination is clause chaining, where two or more clauses are
combined without any overt syntactic marker (i.e. no overt linker indicating coor-
dination or subordination). With chained clauses there is typically only one in the
string (or chain) that is inflected for TMA, while the other clauses in the chain are in
a non-finite and usually more restricted form (e.g. participial). In other words, two or
more clauses clauses are jointly subordinated to a matrix in a chain, the latter being
the clause that carries the TMA information, “like an engine that pulls a string of cars”
(Longacre 2007:â•›398). Most commonly, but by no means always, the matrix is the last
183.â•‡ For a definition of scope, see 12.1.1.2.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 335
clause in the chain. Due to the fact that the matrix, carrying the distinctive marking, is
usually the last clause, this is often called the ‘final clause’ as opposed to the ‘non-final
clauses’ coming before and carrying a more restricted marking. The term ‘non-final
clause’ has largely been replaced with the term medial clause, to capture the fact that
these clauses usually have a medial position in the string. Notice that the cosubordi-
nation here refers to the medial clauses, which are not embedded in each other, but
also do not function independently.
Medial clauses and serial verbs differ in two very significant ways. First of all,
contrary to serial verbs, chained clauses typically have independent marking to in-
dicate whether the following clause has the same or a different subject. The medial
verb (i.e. the verb of the medial clause) is thus typically marked twice, once for its
own subject and once to indicate whether the following clause (or, in some cases,
the final clause) has the same or a different subject, so-called switch reference. Sec-
ondly, chained clauses typically refer to a series of events, as opposed to serial verbs
which refer to one single event. Thus, chained clauses also often express temporal
relations with respect to the other clauses in the chain such as whether the events
overlap or occur in succession to each other (Longacre 2007:â•›399). Clause chain-
ing is typically used for discourse information structuring whereby long chains of
medial clauses have a narrative relationship as, for example, a foregrounding or
backgrounding device.
This section will give some examples of typical properties of medial verbs as well
as the argument tracking device of switch reference. It is by necessity merely a brief
overview of these very complex features. Longacre (2007) discusses clause chaining at
length. For more on clause chaining and foregrounding/backgrounding of informa-
tion, see, for example, Dooley (2010) with references. Much information on clause
chaining can be found in Haiman & Thompson (1988). For a thorough discussion on
switch reference in a formalized analytical framework, see Stirling (1993).
11.3.2.1â•‡ Medial clauses
Medial clauses, or medial verbs, are those clauses (or verbs) that are chained together
cosubordinately to form a structural narrative completed by the finite clause (the ma-
trix, sometimes also called the reference clause in clause chaining contexts). Clause
chaining is common in Papua New Guinea, Australia and the Americas (especially
northern South America and south-western USA), as well as in a belt from the Cauca-
sus stretching through Central Asia all the way to Korea and Japan in Northeast Asia
(Longacre 2007). Mauwake is an example of a language with clause chaining (medial
verbs underlined):
336	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Mauwake (Trans-New Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (294)	 a.	 wien	 en-emi,	 epira	 lolom	 if-emi	 ne	 owowa
			 3pl.gen	 eat-SS.sim	 plate	 mud	 spread-SS.sim	 add	village
			 p-urup-em-ik-e-mik
			 BPx-ascend-SS.sim-be-past-1/3pl
			 ‘They ate it themselves, spread mud on the plates and brought them up
to the village.’
		 b.	 nomokowa	 maala	 war-ep	 ekap-ep	 ifa	 nain	 ifakim-o-k
			 tree	 long	 cut-SS.seq	 come-SS.seq	 snake	 that	 kill-past-3sg
			 ‘He cut a long stick, came and killed the snake.’  (Berghäll 2010:â•›300,â•›304)
In (294a and b) only the last verb of the sentence carries the past tense marker (â•‚eâ•‚ and
â•‚oâ•‚ respectively) while none of the chained medial verbs carry any TMA marking at
all. Notice that the chain of events is coded for overlap versus succession: in (294a)
the medial verbs are coded for overlap with the same subject simultaneous marker
â•‚em(i)â•‚, while in (294b) the medial verbs are coded for succession with the sequential
marker â•‚epâ•‚. Notice also that in both sentences the chained clauses refer to a series of
events: (294a) refers to the eating, the spreading of mud and the bringing of the plates,
three separate events, while (294b) refers to the cutting of a stick, the coming, and the
killing of the snake, again three separate events.
While the majority of clause chaining constructions place the finite clause (matrix
or reference clause) last in the sequence, there are also languages where it appears ini-
tially. In Logoti, for example, the finite (matrix or reference) clause appears sentence
initially, with the chained medial clause following:
		 Logoti (Nilo-Saharan (Moru-Ma’di): DR Congo)
	 (295)	 yɨ̀ko	 dré	 bhógò	 bí	 a-kɨ́-zó	 lɨ́nyá	 bhà-zo
		 brother.in.law	 r	 banana	 leaf	 dirc-gather-srf	 fufu	 put-srf
		 àto	 bhà-zo	 dò-zo-á	 adzí-lé	 agó	 nda	 dré
		 vegetable	 put-srf	 take-srf-3obj	 send-orf	 man	 that	 to
		 ‘The brother-in-law gathered banana leaves, added fufu, added vegetables,
took these, and sent them to that man.’  (Wright 1995:â•›106)
In (295) the first verb in the chain is the finite one, inflected with the realis and direc-
tional markers (dré and aâ•‚ respectively). All other verbs form medial clauses, chained
together and dependent on the initial matrix (or reference) clause. Notice, again, that
the chained clauses refer to separate events: the gathering of leaves, the putting of
fufu, the putting of vegetables, the taking of the items and the sending them off – five
separate events.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 337
11.3.2.2â•‡ Switch reference
Another typical feature of clause chaining is, as mentioned, switch reference, which
is basically a referent tracking device indicating if the subject of the following clause
is the same as or different from the one in the present clause. Consider the examples
from Amele below:
		 Amele (Trans-New Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (296)	 a.	 ija	 hu-m-ig	 sab	 j-ig-a
			 1sg	 come-SS-1sg	 food	 eat-1sg-tod.past
			 ‘I came and ate the food.’
		 b.	 ija	 ho-co-min	 sab	 ja-g-a
			 1sg	 come-DS-1sg	food	 eat-2sg-tod.past
			 ‘I came and you ate the food.’  (Roberts 1988:â•›49)
In (296a) the finite verb is marked for TMA (the suffix â•‚a ‘today’s past’) as well as
for agreement (â•‚ig ‘1st singular’). The medial verb huâ•‚ ‘come’ is marked with the same
subject suffix â•‚m to indicate that the subject of the verb is the same as for the following
verb. In (296b) the switch reference marker changes to the different subject suffix â•‚co
to indicate that the subject of the verb is not the same as the following verb. Notice
that switch reference is not necessarily the same as verbal agreement: both verbs in
(296) are inflected for verbal agreement with their argument.
In some languages reference tracking is part of the verbal agreement. For these
languages the third person may be divided into two categories, essentially coding
“third person same subject” and “third person different subject”. Central Yup’ik is an
example of such a language:
		 Central Yup’ik (Eskimo-Aleut (Eskimo): USA)
	 (297)	 a.	 Dena-q	 quya-u-q	 Toni-aq	 cinga-llra-Ø-ku
			 PN-abs	 happy-intr-3.abs	 PN-abs	 greet-because-3/3-dep
			 ‘Denai is happy because shej greeted Toni.’
		 b.	 Dena-q	 quya-u-q	 Toni-aq	 cinga-llra-mi-ku
			 PN-abs	 happy-intr-3.abs	 PN-abs	 greet-because-SS-dep
			 ‘Denai is happy because shei greeted Toni.’  (Payne 1997:â•›322)
In (297a) Dena is happy because somebody else greeted Toni, which is indicated with
the verbal 3/3 agreement marker Ø (and noted in the translation with the subscript
i for Dena and j for the third person who is not coreferential with Dena). In (297b)
Dena is happy because she herself greeted Toni, indicated with the verbal agreement
marker â•‚mi which denotes third person same subject (and indicated in the translation
with the subscript i showing that Dena and she refer to the same person). The terms
for these kinds of systems may vary; ‘third person same subject’ marker is sometimes
referred to as, for example, ‘reflexive’, ‘fourth person’ and ‘recurrent’.
338	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Many languages have portmanteau markers for reference tracking and temporal
relation. In Eastern Pomo, for example, the reference tracking devices denote mood
in that there are different markers for realis and irrealis clauses. Furthermore, in the
realis mood two temporal references are distinguished, overlap or simultaneity (‘coin-
cident’ events in Mithun’s (1993) terminology) and succession or sequentiality (‘con-
secutive’ events in Mithun’s terminology). This leads to six different markers:
		 Eastern Pomo (Hokan (Pomoan): USA)
								 same subject	 different subject
		 irrealis	 			 hi				 hla
		 realis	 simultaneous	 in				 da
				 sequential		 ba				 li (Mithun 1993:â•›121)
	 (298)	 a.	 qhá=·l	 yó-hi	 maʔá	 qha·díway=ʔkhe
			 water=to	 go-SS.irr	 food	 buy=fut

 (Mithun 1993:â•›120,â•›124,â•›127,â•›131)
In (298a) the suffix â•‚hi indicates that the clause is in irrealis and that the subject in the
next clause is the same (hei and hei shows that the subject is coreferential). In (298b)
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 339
the clause is in irrealis and the subject in the next clause is different, as indicated by
â•‚hla. The clauses in (298c–f) are all in realis. In (298c) the subject is the same across all
clauses, and the events are all simultaneous, as indicated by the suffix â•‚(i)n (effectively
indicating something like The mani (hei) fought with his wife, (hei) kicked her and (hei)
slammed her to the ground). In (298d) the events are again simultaneous, but the sub-
jects differ between the clauses, as indicated by â•‚da. In (298e) the events are sequential
(he first slipped, then fell), and the subject is the same in both clauses, as indicated by
â•‚ba. Finally, in (298f) the events are again sequential but the subjects differ between
the clauses, being first hei then itj (or, more accurately, ‘3.singulari’ and ‘3.singularj’),
as indicated by â•‚li.
11.4	 Complex clauses in sign languages
Sign languages may, just as spoken languages, form complex clauses that are either
coordinated, subordinated or cosubordinated. Coordination in sign languages tends
to be asyndetic (where the units are juxtaposed without any overt linker) although
some syndetic constructions (where an overt linker coordinates the units) can also
be found. ST, for example, does have a sign for ‘and’ (the sign PLUS) but may also
form asyndetic coordinate constructions, essentially in the form of a list. Here the
non-dominant hand typically maintains the list as a kind of discourse guide while the
dominant hand signs the various entities of the coordinated clause.
		 ST (Sign Language: Sweden)
	 (299)	 (tap index) DIRECTOR (tap middle finger) CONSULTANT (tap ring finger)
		 ONE-LIST----------------TWO-LIST-----------------------------THREE-LIST
		 SECRETARY INCLUDE.tap ring finger ALSO WORK AS INTERPRETER
		 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------THREE
		 ‘One director, one consultant and one secretary who will also function as an
interpreter.’  (Ahlgren & Bergman 2006:â•›53)
In (299) we have a multiple coordination. The three-dimensional modality of sign lan-
guages allows for a coordination strategy whereby each coordinated unit is kept track
of in the form of a list on the non-dominant hand. The list can thus easily go up to five
units. There are no overt coordinating linkers in the construction, as the so-called list
buoys (see below) serve to indicate how the clauses relate to each other. This is what
Liddell calls buoys because they “help guide the discourse by serving as conceptual
landmarks as the discourse continues” (2003:â•›223). In the above construction we have
an example of list buoys (i.e. pointers to help maintain a list). Liddell also identi-
fies theme buoys, fragment buoys and pointer buoys. Buoys seem to be widespread
among sign languages. For more details, see Liddell (2003:â•›223ff).
340	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Very common is to have asyndetic coordination, i.e. juxtaposition of the coordi-
nated entities:
		 LIU (Sign Language: Jordan)
	 (300)	 a.	 FATHER Ø MOTHER DEAF INDEX1 NEG// SPEAK
			 ‘My father (and) mother aren’t Deaf, they speak.’
		 b.	 INDEX1 EXIST FISH Ø NEG-EXIST INDEX3
			 ‘I have a fish (and) she doesn’t.’  (Hendriks 2008:â•›79,â•›122)
In (300a) the units FATHER and MOTHER are simply juxtaposed to indicate coordi-
nation. Likewise, in (300b) the two clauses ‘I have fish’ and ‘she does not have (fish)’
are merely juxtaposed to indicate coordination; none of the constructions have any
overt linking marker. In some sign languages juxtaposition is used for conjunctive
coordination while adversative coordination is syndetic. NGT does not have any sign
for ‘and’, but does have a sign BUT (van Gijn 2004). Auslan also has syndetic adversa-
tive coordination:
		 Auslan (Sign Language: Australia)
	 (301)	 K-I-M LIKE CAT BUT P-A-T PREFER DOG
		 ‘Kim likes cats but Pat prefers dogs.’  (Johnston & Schembri 2009:â•›213)
In (301) the disjunction BUT is overtly marking the coordination of the two clauses
‘Kim likes cats’ and ‘Pat prefers dogs’.
Subordinate complement clauses are often simply juxtaposed without any overt
subordinating marker:
		 NGT (Sign Language: the Netherlands)
	 (302)	 INDEX3 BELIEVE [EARTH FLAT]
		 ‘S/he believes [that the earth is flat].’  (van Gijn 2004:â•›74)
In (302) the clause ‘that the earth is flat’ serves as the complement to the verb Â�
BELIEVE.
There is no overt subordination marker. One type of overt indication of subordina-
tion, however, is scope of negation. Typically the negation has scope over the entire
main clause, which means that it also includes subordinate clauses. Consider the fol-
lowing example:
		 ASL (Sign Language: USA)
	 (303)	 _________neg___________________
		 INDEX1 WANT [INDEX3 GO-AWAY]
		 ‘I didn’t want [him to leave].’  (Sandler & Lillo-Martin 2006:â•›299)
In (303) the negation has scope over the entire main clause. If the sentence would
have consisted of two coordinated main clauses, the negation would have had to be
repeated. This is, in a sense, an overt indication that the second clause is embedded
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 341
in, i.e. subordinate to, the first (matrix) clause. A translation to the effect of something
like ‘I didn’t want him and he left’ is therefore not possible.
In many sign languages subordination is marked with non-manual signing and
other prosodic features, such as pauses. In IPSL, for example, the subordinate clause is
indicated by wide-open eyes and raised eyebrows, a head nod at the last sign of the sub-
ordinate clause and a pause after the last sign of the subordinate clause (Zeshan 2003c).
		 IPSL (Sign Language: India, Pakistan)
	 (304)	 MAIN’	 AMI:R	 PAIDA:I$	 DEAF	 HAI	 MAIN’	 MADAD
		 I	 rich	 born	 deaf	 exist	 I	 help
		 subord--------------	 subord-----------
		 ‘If someone is rich, and if he has a deaf child, he will help (other deaf people).’
 (Zeshan 2003c:â•›204)184
In (304) we have two subordinate conditional adverbial clauses, ‘if someone is rich…’
and ‘if someone has a deaf child…’, both of which are marked as subordinate with
non-manuals. Notice that the two conditional clauses are coordinated by juxtaposi-
tion. The difference between types of subordinate clauses is not made explicit in IPSL.
Thus the second subordinate clause in (304) may also translate into a relative clause,
as in ‘if he has a child who is deaf’.
Some sign languages have relative pronouns that are distinct from other pro-
nouns. In LIS, for example, a relative clause may be marked not only with the non-
manual subordination marking of raised eyebrows, but also with relative pronouns:
		 LIS (Sign Language: Italy)
	 (305)	 BOYi	 CALL PRORELi LEAVE DONE
				 subord------------
		 ‘The boy [who called] left.’  (Cecchetto et al. 2006:â•›952f)
In (305) we have two separate markers for the subordinate clause; first of all, the
general non-manual subordination marker that is held throughout the subordinate
clause, and secondly, the relative pronoun, glossed as PROREL, which is coreferential
with the head NP in the matrix. The relative pronoun “is signed with the wrist bent
toward the floor, the hand closed with the index finger extended and moving from left
to right” (Cecchetto et al. 2006:â•›953) while the personal pronoun is signed in the space
of the entity referred to.185
184.â•‡ It is in IPSL common to use the first person for general statements, as in ‘if I am rich’ meaning
‘if someone is rich’.
185.â•‡ See Cecchetto et al. (2006) for a discussion on why the LIS relative clause constructions should
be interpreted as correlative clauses.
342	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Many sign languages have constructions whereby sequences of motion verbs de-
scribe a single event:
		 AdaSL (Sign Language: Ghana)
	 (306)	 ENTER-head MOVE GO-ROUND DIRECTIONAL-INDEX-down
		 ‘(The ball) entered him through his head and so he went down
		 (through the drainpipe).’  (Nyst 2007:â•›186)
In (306) the verb sequence ENTER, MOVE and GO-ROUND describe the single
event of the ball entering and going through the head. In other words, the verb se-
quence does not describe three separate events of the ball first entering, then mov-
ing, then going around. Furthermore, the verbs in the sequence share arguments.
These kinds of sequences also tend to form a prosodic unit, typically manifested in a
consistent eye gaze throughout the sequence as well as a lack of pauses between the
verbs of the sequence. Due to these characteristics, these kinds of constructions have
been interpreted as serial verb constructions, more specifically serial verbs of motion
(SupallaÂ�1990). As the units in these constructions are neither subordinated to each
other nor function independently, this constitutes an instance of cosubordination.
	 11.5		 Summary
All languages have the capacity to combine units and clauses to form more complex construc-
tions. Main clauses are clauses that function independently as complete sentences. Main clauses
may consist of a matrix clause and its subordinate clause(s). A matrix clause is a clause minus its
subordinated clause; it may or may not function independently as a main clause. Subordinate
clauses are embedded in their matrix clause and cannot function independently.
Coordination involves linking together two or more main clauses. Coordination may be con-
junctive, disjunctive, adversative or causal. Coordinated constructions often involve ellipsis, or
clause reduction, where repeated material is deleted to avoid redundancy.
In subordination one (or several) clause(s) is (are) subordinated to, or embedded in, another
clause. Complement clauses are subordinate clauses that function as arguments to their matrix.
Adverbial clauses function as adjuncts to their matrix. Relative clauses function as modifiers of
a noun or NP.
Cosubordination involves complex clauses where units are not embedded in each other,
which makes them similar to coordinated clauses, but where the units also do not function in-
dependently as full grammatical sentences, which makes them similar to subordinated clauses.
A serial verb construction is a form of cosubordination whereby a single event is expressed by
multiple verbs that share grammatical features and arguments and form one prosodic unit.
Clause chaining is a construction where multiple medial verbs form a chain that is embedded in
their matrix clause. Chained clauses typically express switch reference.
	 Chapter 11.â•‡ Complex clauses	 343
Coordinated clauses are very often asyndetic in sign languages, although adversative claus-
es are more likely to be syndetic than conjunct clauses. It is very common for sign languages to
make use of buoys, for example list buoys, which keep track of the coordinated units. Subordi-
nated complement clauses are also typically juxtaposed, but many sign languages make use of
non-manual subordination markers for adverbial and relative clauses. Cosubordination in the
form of serial verbs, specifically serial verbs of motion, is widespread among sign languages.

Chapter 12
Speech acts and politeness
Languages are universally used in interaction between individuals. When we engage
in any kind of communication we do so with the purpose of giving information, re-
questing information, or getting people to do something. This chapter first deals with
speech acts (12.1) and the main sentence types found in all known languages, both
spoken and signed: declaratives (12.1.1), interrogatives (12.1.2) and imperatives (12.1.3).
I then briefly discuss issues relating to politeness (12.2) and give a few examples of
some devices languages make use of to uphold the necessary levels of politeness, such
as through indirect speech acts (12.2.1) and honorifics (12.2.2). Section 12.3 gives an
overview of topics related to speech acts and politeness in sign languages.
12.1	 Speech acts
We should never forget that language is used as a medium of communication between
individuals. While a language may be used for innumerable purposes, all known lan-
guages are capable of serving at least three functions: to pass on information, to glean
information, and to issue commands. In fact we rarely just make an utterance for no
purpose whatsoever.186 As soon as we use language for any of these three core purpos-
es of asserting something, asking something or commanding something, we engage
in a speech act, that is, we perform an act by making an utterance.
The three basic sentence types, or types of speech act, that seem to be universal
to human language are declaratives, interrogatives and imperatives. Often we may
identify further sentence types, such as prohibitives and optatives, as subcategories
of these basic speech act types (König & Siemund 2007). A declarative is basically
an assertion, a statement made in order to pass on information. An example of a
declarative sentence is You are sitting on the floor. An interrogative is a request for
186.â•‡ This actually also holds true for so called phatic communion, where utterances are made not
to convey information, but for social reasons, such as maintaining social contact or in order to avoid
long silences – in other words, when we engage in small talk. Here too the act serves a purpose,
namely the purpose of comfortable social interaction. See, for example, Laver (1975). But see also
Urbanová (2007) for a discussion on why phatic communion and small talk are two separate (even
if interrelated) concepts.
346	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Â�
information, posed as a question with the intention of gleaning information. Exam-
ples of interrogatives are Why are you sitting on the floor? and Are you sitting on the
floor? (the difference between these two kinds of questions will be discussed below).
An imperative is a command, uttered with the intention of getting someone to do
something. An example of an imperative is Sit on the floor!
The following will discuss how the three sentence types mentioned above are
coded grammatically among languages. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to give
a comprehensive discussion on all the subtleties involved in the myriad ways speakers
may use their language for various purposes. For an accessible overview on theories
of speech acts, see Sadock (2006). Geis (2006) provides a thorough discussion on how
speech acts are employed in natural conversation. For a very accessible discussion on
the typology of speech act distinctions, including minor sentence types such as ex-
clamatives and answers to questions, see König & Siemund (2007). For a typological
overview of non-declarative speech acts, see Givón (2001b:â•›287ff).
12.1.1		 Declaratives
Declaratives are usually the least marked sentence type and are typically used for
statements, such as The puppy is playing with a ball. Declarative sentences can be ei-
ther affirmative or negative, where the former expresses an assertion about something
and the latter negates (reverses) an assertion. For instance, an assertion like The man
is walking (or The puppy is playing with a ball or any other plain statement) may be
negated to The man is not walking (or The puppy is not playing with a ball), thus revers-
ing the assertion of the affirmative.
12.1.1.1â•‡ Affirmative declaratives
Affirmative declaratives are typically used for descriptive speech acts, such as as-
serting something, describing something, complaining or bragging about something,
predicting or promising something, and so on. It is typically the most frequent sen-
tence type, it is typically the least restricted in its distribution, and it may typically
combine with all the TMA options of the language.
While affirmative declaratives are most commonly unmarked as a sentence type,
this is by no means an absolute universal. Sheko is an example of a language where
affirmative declarative sentences must also be marked:
		 Sheko (Afro-Asiatic (North Omotic): Ethiopia)
	 (307)	 a.	 kom̩-s	 maak-ab-əra	 íʃì-ʃe-ke
			 chief:def-m	 tell-rel-acc	 3pl-forget-decl1
			 ‘They forgot what the chief told them.’
		 b.	 k᾽áy-ē,	 gob	 sats᾽-á-ke
			 rise-imp	 sky	 become.light-3ms-decl1
			 ‘Stand up, it has become light/the sun came up.’  (Hellenthal 2007:â•›22)
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 347
In (307a) we have a straightforward statement. The declarative marker â•‚ke obligato-
rily attaches to the verb; something like *kom̩s maakabəra íʃìʃe (without the declara-
tive marker) would not be acceptable. In (307b) we have an example of an utterance
containing an imperative (k᾽áyē ‘Stand up!’) and a declarative (gob sats᾽áke ‘The sun
has risen.’). Both sentence types receive their own specific markers, â•‚ē and â•‚ke respec-
tively. It should be noted that in addition to the declarative â•‚ke, Sheko has a second
declarative marker â•‚me which appears only in irrealis assertions, both of which are
in paradigmatic opposition to other modal markers such as imperative and optative
(Hellenthal 2007). It could therefore conceivably be argued that â•‚ke should be an-
alysed as a realis marker and â•‚me as an irrealis marker rather than declarative mark-
ers. In Tauya, however, we have a declarative which appears in both realis and irrealis
propositions and which may combine with modal markers:
		 Tauya (Trans-New-Guinea (Madang): Papua New Guinea)
	 (308)	 a.	 mene-a-te	 mepi	 ʔatou-a-ʔa
			 stay-3sg-DS	 come.down	 arrive-3sg-decl187
			 ‘She stayed and he came down and arrived.’
		 b.	 ya-ni	 tei-mene-amu-ʔa
			 1sg-erg	 catch-stat-1sg.fut-decl
			 ‘I will have it.’
		 c.	 ʔei-ra	 mene-a-rafo-ʔa
			 there-top	 stay-3sg-dub-decl
			 ‘Maybe he’s there.’ (MacDonald 1990:â•›208–9)
In (308a) we have a plain statement; the declarative marker â•‚ʔa necessarily attaches
to the finite verb. In (308b) â•‚ʔa is still necessary, even though we have a prediction,
that is, a statement that pertains to the future, which is an irrealis proposition. Thus
â•‚ʔa is not a realis marker. In (308c) â•‚ʔa combines with the dubitative modal marker
(â•‚rafo-), showing that it is not a modal marker in paradigmatic opposition to other
modal markers.
12.1.1.2â•‡ Negative declaratives
A negation reverses the truth of a proposition. For instance, the declarative Mary is
drinking tea states the actuality that Mary is drinking tea. Adding a negative marker
reverses this actuality: Mary is not drinking tea states that whatever it is that Mary
may be doing, she is not drinking tea. All known languages have a way of forming a
negative declarative, but the strategies may differ. Languages may also have different
types of negation. A clausal negation is a negation that negates an entire clause, giving
a negative counterpart to an affirmative declarative, as in Mary is not drinking tea (the
187.â•‡ â•‚ʔa is glossed as ‘indicative/unmarked’ in the source.
348	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
negative declarative counterpart of the affirmative Mary is drinking tea). A constitu-
ent negation negates only a particular constituent in the clause, such as NP negation
as in No tea could be found, where the negative no only refers to the NP tea and not to
the entire clause. Languages may also have negative pronouns, as in Nothing could be
found, and negative adverbs, as in Mary never drinks tea. This section will deal specifi-
cally with clausal negation in declarative sentences. For a very accessible overview of
negation, see Miestamo (2007). See also Givón (2001a:â•›369ff).
The negation can have different scope over the sentence. Scope essentially refers
to that section which is affected by the meaning of a particular form. In English, for
example, the negation typically has scope over everything that comes after it. Com-
pare I deliberately didn’t step on the snail with I didn’t deliberately step on the snail. In
the former sentence it was a conscious and premeditated act to not step on the snail.
In the latter sentence I did step on the snail, but the act was accidental.
In all known languages clausal negation is realized through morphology one way
or another: “[t]here are no known instances of languages in which negation is realized
by a change in word order or by intonation, and all languages have negative mor-
phemes” (Dryer 2011g). Languages tend to have either negative particles or negative
affixes – of the 1159 languages in Dryer’s (2011g) database on negative morphemes,
502 (or 43.3%) form negative declarative sentences through negative particles, such as
English with the particle not or Gaagudju with the particle gaayu.188 This strategy is
spread all over the world.
		 Gaagudju (Australian (Gaagudju): Australia)
	 (309)	 gaayu	 i-n-yii-ngi
		 neg	 3i-irr-go-past
		 ‘He didn’t go.’  (Harvey 2002:â•›322)
The second largest group in Dryer’s database, with 396 languages (34.2%), forms nega-
tive declarative sentences by way of a negative affix. This is also a strategy spread all
over the world, except in the largely isolating Southeast Asian languages. Chichewa is
an example of such a language, with its negative prefix siâ•‚ (or sâ•‚ if it precedes a vowel).
		 Chichewa (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe)
	 (310)	 Mkângo	 s-ú-ku-wá-phwány-a	 maûngu.
		 iii.lion	 neg-iii.sm-pres.-vi.obj-smash-fv	 vi.pumpkins
		 ‘The lion is not smashing them, the pumpkins.’  (Mchombo 1998:â•›503)
188.â•‡ Gaagudju has another negative particle, ibárdbi, which “does not deny the occurrence of an
event or the existence of an entity, but instead means something like ‘it is not the case that X can be
predicated of Y’â†œ” (Harvey 2002:â•›321).
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 349
The remaining types of strategies all make up proportionally rather small groups
of languages. In 47 languages (4.1%) in Dryer’s sample the negative declarative is
formed through a type of auxiliary verb which inflects for person and number in the
same way as other auxiliaries. Finnish is an example of such a language, as shown in
(85) repeated here for convenience:
		 Finnish (Uralic (Finnic): Finland)
	 (311)	 en	 tule	 kotiin
		 neg.1sg	 come	 home.ill
		 ‘I won’t come home.’  (Sulkala & Karjalainen 1992:â•›115)
In (311) the auxiliary en is inflected for person and number, in this case first person sin-
gular. While this is a comparatively rare strategy, languages with auxiliary verb negatives
are found in most parts of the world, but are especially prominent in northern Eurasia in
a belt stretching from Finland to the Russian Far East, along the North American Pacific
coast and in a cluster in Central Africa. Auxiliary verb negatives are completely absent
in Australia, Europe (except for Finland) and the Middle East in Dryer’s sample.
In 73 languages (6.3%), clustered mainly in West Africa, Southeast Asia and the
South Pacific islands, it is not possible to determine if the negator is an auxiliary or a
particle. For example, if a language has little or no morphology and the verb carries
no inflection, a negative word may be an auxiliary without any inflection (just like the
other verbs), but it may also be a particle. In Tinrin, for example, the negative is not
inflected, but neither is the verb:
		 Tinrin (Austronesian (Oceanic): New Caledonia)
	 (312)	 nrâ	 see	 tròa	 warra	 nrâ	 toni
		 3sg	 neg	 arrive	 yet	 sm	 PN
		 ‘Tony has not arrived yet.’  (Osumi 1995:â•›224)
In cases like Example (312) it is not possible to determine whether the negative word
see should be considered a particle or an auxiliary verb, although for some languages
there might be syntactic criteria that indicate how the negative is best classified.
A small group of 21 languages (1.8%), found in all parts of the world in Dryer’s
sample except Europe, the northern Eurasian mainland and Southeast Asia, have both
a negative affix and a negative word. In Orokaiva, for example, negation is expressed
with the suffix â•‚ae except for those clauses that are in the future tense or habitual as-
pect, for which the particle mane is used:
		 Orokaiva (Trans-New Guinea (Binanderean): Papua New Guinea)
	 (313)	 a.	 na	 pamb-ae
			 1sg	 go-neg
			 ‘I didn’t go.’
350	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
	 (313)	 b.	 na	 mane	 pamba-so-n-a
			 1sg	 neg	 go-fut-1sg-ind
			 ‘I will not go.’  (Larsen 1977:â•›21)
Finally, 120 languages (10.4%) in Dryer’s sample have double negation, i.e. two si-
multaneous negative morphemes.189 In standard French, for example, the negative
declarative sentence is marked by ne … pas:
		 French (Indo-European (Romance): France)
	 (314)	 je	 ne	 veux	 pas	 manger
		 1sg.nom	 neg	 want.1sg.pres	neg	 eat
		 ‘I don’t want to eat.’  (source: personal knowledge)
Because colloquial French regularly drops ne (giving sentences like Je veux pas manger
‘I don’t want to eat’), it is coded as a language with negative particles rather than with
double negation in Dryer (2011g). In Makaa this double negation is expressed through
the parafix a-…(H)-ɛ and a high tone (glossed as (neg.H) here) on the verb stem.
		 Makaa (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Cameroon)
	 (315)	 mə̀	 aÌ•-cál-ɛ́	 mə́-lə́ndú
		 1sg	neg-cut(neg.H)-neg	 vi-palm.tree
		 ‘I do not cut down palm trees.’  (Heath 2003:â•›346)
This strategy is especially common in sub-Saharan Africa and Papua New Guinea, but
can also be found in both North and South American languages.
Languages may display secondary strategies of negation that need to be employed
alongside the primary strategy. For instance, in Makaa (Example (315) above) we find
not only the double negator affixes, but also an obligatory change in tone: the verb
stem gets a high tone together with the parafixes. Another secondary strategy in nega-
tive declaratives may be change of word order, as in Lokạạ, where affirmative declara-
tives are typically SVO while negative declaratives are typically SOV:
		 Lokạạ (Niger-Congo (Cross River): Nigeria)
	 (316)	 a.	 Úbì	 ó-kpèèyì	 kò-póó
			 PN	 i.agr-sell	 xi-cup
			 S	 V	 O
			 ‘Ubi sold a cup.’
189.â•‡ The term ‘double negation’ is sometimes used for such constructions as I’ve not said nothing
(where two negative forms are used in the same clause).
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 351
		 b.	 Úbì	 kò-póó	 òó-kpèèyì
			 PN	 xi-cup	 neg/i.agr-sell
			 S	 O	 V
			 ‘Ubi didn’t sell a cup.’  (Baker 2005:â•›126)
Notice that the tone of the verb stem â•‚kpèèyì ‘sell’ remains the same in both sentences.
In other words, the negative only affects the word order, and not the tone. Yet another
secondary effect of negation may be the number of TMA distinctions allowed; in
languages where TMA distinctions are affected by negation, there are typically few-
er distinctions in the negative than in the affirmative. In Burmese, for example, the
punctual aspect and the realis/irrealis modal distinctions are lost in the negative:
		 Burmese (Sino-Tibetan (Burmese-Lolo): Myanmar)
	 (317)	 a.	 thu	 yau’	 pi
			 3sg	 reach	 punct
			 ‘(S)he has arrived.’
		 b.	 thu	 ma-yau’	 hpu:
			 3sg	 neg-arrive	 neg
			 ‘(S)he hasn’t arrived.’
		 c.	 tin hpei	 a ye’	 thau’	 tha-la
			 PN	 liquor	 drink	 r-q
			 ‘Does Tin Pe drink liquor?’
		 d.	 tin hpei	 a ye’	 ma-thau’	 hpu:
			 PN	 liquor	 neg-drink	 neg
			 ‘Tin Pe doesn’t drink liquor.’
		 e.	 thu	 pyo:	 ma-la
			 3sg	 speak	 irr-q
			 ‘Will (s)he speak?’
		 f.	 thu	 ma-pyo:	 hpu:
			 3sg	 neg-speak	 neg
			 ‘(S)he won’t speak’  (Soe 1999:â•›145–7)190
The punctual aspect in (317a) as well as the realis and irrealis mood in (317c and e)
respectively are all neutralized with the negative, as can be seen in (317b, d and f).
190.â•‡ The transcription and glossing in Soe (1999) differs somewhat from that of others. In Cornyn
(1944), for example, the negative maâ•‚ … hpu: is transcribed maâ•‚ … phû/bû; the punctual marker â•‚pi
is transcribed â•‚pí/â•‚bí and analysed as denoting that “the action or condition has already begun” (12);
the realis marker tha is transcribed â•‚té/â•‚dé and glossed as “without reference to time, which may be
present or past” (12); the irrealis marker ma is transcribed -mé and glossed as a future tense marker
(12). Notice also that Soe does not mark tone.
352	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
These secondary strategies are what may be called asymmetric negations. In sym-
metric negations “the structure of the negative is identical to the structure of the af-
firmative, except for the presence of the negative marker(s)” (Miestamo 2011b) while
in asymmetric negations the structure differs from the affirmative one way or another.
Of the 297 languages in Miestamo’s (2011b) database, 114 (or 38.4%) have a symmetric
negation strategy while 53 (17.8%) have asymmetric negation. The largest group, with
130 languages (43.8%), has both symmetric and asymmetric negation, in that it is sym-
metric in some contexts but not in others. English is an example of a language classed
as having both symmetric and asymmetric negation due to the asymmetry displayed
with emphatic sentences (see Miestamo 2011a). Sentences like He has eaten versus
He has not eaten exhibit symmetric negation. However, asymmetry is exhibited with
respect to the distinction between emphatic and non-emphatic sentences (such as
He sings versus He does sing, where the latter is pragmatically marked for emphasis),
which is lost in negation (both have to be negated as He does not sing).
12.1.2		 Interrogatives
All languages have some way of gleaning information, that is, of forming interroga-
tives with the purpose of extracting information. Depending on what kind of infor-
mation is requested, interrogatives may take the shape of different kinds of questions.
If the information sought after is merely confirmation or disconfirmation of the truth
value of an utterance (essentially through the answers Yes or No), we form polar ques-
tions. If we need more elaborate information, which cannot be provided by a mere Yes
or No, we form content questions. An example of a polar question is Will you come
home today? where the answers may be either Yes or No (although various intermedi-
ate answers may also be permitted, such as Maybe or I don’t know). An example of
a content question is When will you come home? where more elaborate information
would be needed than Yes or No to constitute an acceptable answer.191
12.1.2.1â•‡ Polar questions
With polar questions (also called yes-no questions) the expected answer is typically
Yes or No, although, as mentioned, there are usually a few other alternatives available
(such as Perhaps). Most languages have specific strategies for forming polar questions,
often a combination of strategies.
It is very common for languages to have a distinct intonation pattern for polar
questions. Often a polar question has a rising intonation, as is the case in English (try
191.â•‡ But see Huddleston (1994), who makes a clear distinction between interrogatives and questions
in that interrogatives are a syntactic type of sentence, contrasting with declaratives, imperatives and
exclamatives, while questions are a semantic category defining the set of answers required.
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 353
listening to yourself first saying You are home then Are you home?), but this is not a
universal. Hawai‘i Creole English, for example, has a falling intonation for polar ques-
tions (source: own fieldwork). In a number of languages intonation may be the only
device to mark a polar question. Of 954 languages in Dryer’s (2011s) database on polar
questions 173 (18.1%) mark polar questions through intonation only. These languages
are spread over the world, but are especially common in sub-Saharan Africa, Australia
and Papua New Guinea, as well as South and Meso-America. Italian is an example of
such a language.
		 Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italy)
	 (318)	 a.	 Laura	 viene	 con	 ↘noi	 (statement)
			 PN	 come.3sg.pres.ind	 with	 1pl
			 ‘Laura is coming with us.’
		 b.	 Laura	 viene	 con	 ↗noi	 (question)
			 PN	 come.3sg.pres.ind	 with	 1pl
			 ‘Is Laura coming with us?’  (source: personal knowledge)
In (318a and b) the only difference between the two sentences is that the declarative
statement has a falling intonation (indicated by ↘) while the interrogative polar ques-
tion has a rising intonation (indicated by ↗). It should be noted that intonation as a
strategy is underrepresented in Dryer’s map, since a language has only been coded for
that strategy if there are no other grammatical means for forming a polar question in
the language. However, “[i]n some languages, intonation may be the most common
means of indicating a polar question, but if some other method is used a minority of
the time, then the language is shown on the map according to that method” (Dryer
2011s). It is common for languages to combine intonation with any of the strategies
discussed below.
A well known, but actually quite rare strategy for marking polar question is through
change of word order. This is found in only 13 languages (1.4%) in Dryer’s database, al-
most all of them clustered in Western Europe, except for two in insular Southeast Asia
(Manggarayi (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia) and Palauan) and
one in South America, Warekena (Arawakan (Arawakan): Venezuela). Swedish is an
example of a language that employs inverted word order to form polar questions:
		 Swedish (Indo-European (Germanic): Sweden)
	 (319)	 a.	 han	 kommer
			 3sg.m	 come.pres
			 ‘He is coming.’
		 b.	 kommer	 han
			 come.pres	 3sg.m
			 ‘Is he coming?’  (source: own knowledge)
354	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
English is also an example of such a language (compare the translations of Exam-
ple (319) above, where the inflected verb moves to sentence initial position in the polar
question).
A very rare strategy indeed is to mark polar questions through the absence of a
declarative marker. This is found in only four languages (0.4%) in Dryer’s database,
Dinka, Kabardian (Northwest Caucasian (Northwest Caucasian): Russia), Puquina
and Zayse (Afro-Asiatic (North Omotic): Ethiopia).
		 Puquina (Isolate: Bolivia)
	 (320)	 a.	 cuhaña-qu-ench
			 believe-1S.sg-decl
			 ‘I believe.’
		 b.	 cuhaña-pi
			 believe-2S
			 ‘Do you believe?’  (Adelaar & Muysken 2004:â•›354)
In (320a) the obligatory declarative marker â•‚(e)nch/â•‚(a)nch suffixes to the verb, while
in (320b) the absence of this marker indicates that the utterance is a polar question.
A rather more common strategy is to have a special verbal inflection signalling
the polar question. This is found in 164 languages (17.2%) in Dryer’s database, also
spread over the world, but especially common in mainland South and Southeast Asia
as well as South and North America. Korean is an example of such a language, with
its question marker suffix â•‚ni or â•‚nyi, as is Burmese (see Example (317c and e) above).
		 Korean (Isolate: N, S Korea)
	 (321)	 pi	 ka	 o-ni/o-(nu)-nyi
		 rain	 nom	 come-q/come-ind-q
		 ‘Is it raining?’  (Sohn 2001:â•›269)
The by far most common strategy in Dryer’s database is to have question particles,
which may either be a free particle or a clitic added to the declarative sentence. This
is found in 584 languages (61.2%) spread all over the world except in Western Eu-
rope. Ainu is an example of a language with a question particle, as is Supyire (see
Example (127) above).
		 Ainu (Isolate: Japan)
	 (322)	 pirka-p	 ne	 ya
		 rich-person	 be	 q
		 ‘Is (he) a rich person?’  (Shibatani 1990:â•›24)
In (322) the particle ya signals that the utterance is a question. In Ainu this particle is
sentence final. This is the most common pattern for languages with question particles
(Dryer 2011v). Question particles may also be sentence initial, as in Tzutujil:
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 355
		 Tzutujil (Mayan (Mayan): Guatemala)
	 (323)	 la	 n-at-war-i

		 ‘Are you going to sleep?’  (Dayley 1981:â•›334)
Question particles or clitics may also appear in other positions in the sentence. For
more details, see Dryer (2011v). Languages may also have tag questions (or inter-
rogative tags), which can be seen as a type of question particle but which “contribute
a certain bias by raising expectations toward either a positive or a negative answer”
(König & Siemund 2007:â•›296). English has tags where the negative tag presupposes a
positive answer and a positive tag a negative answer:
	 (324)	 a.	 You do know it, don’t you? (Expected answer: Yes, I do.)
		 b.	 You don’t know it, do you? (Expected answer: No, I don’t.)
Tags tend to occur at the end of the sentence irrespective of the basic word order of
the language. They are sometimes considered a shortened version of a different strat-
egy, the disjunctive-negative structure, also known as ‘A-not-A-construction’, which
is especially common in Chinese languages, such as Mandarin, but can also be found
elsewhere.
		 Mandarin (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese): China)
	 (325)	 tā	 chī-bu-chī	 píngguǒ
		 3sg	 eat-not-eat	 apple
		 ‘Does s/he eat apples?’  (Li & Thompson 1990:â•›828)
In (325) the polar question is formed by giving the verb (chī ‘eat’) twice, once posi-
tive and once negated. It may be that tags originate from A-not-A-constructions, and
that question particles, in turn, originate from tags and the A-not-A-construction (see
Harris & Campbell 1995:â•›294ff for a discussion on the origin of question particles).
whispered statements
In Nkore-Kiga, the only difference between the statement and the question is how the final
syllable is pronounced. In declaratives the final syllable is whispered (indicated through su-
perscript here), while in interrogatives it is voiced. This strategy can also be found in Burunge
(Afro-Asiatic (Southern Cushitic): Tanzania) (Kiessling 1994).
Nkore-Kiga (Niger-Congo (Bantoid): Uganda)

	 ac-man
	 ‘It is a man.’
b.	 n’-omushaija
	 ac-man
	 ‘Is it a man?’ (Taylor 1985:â•›6)
356	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Notice, however, that some languages use the A-not-A-construction together with a
question particle:
		 Turkish (Altaic (Turkic): Turkey)
	 (326)	 ahmet	 sinema-ya	 git-ti	 mi	 git-me-di	 mi
		 PN	 cinema-dat	 go-past	 q	 go-neg-past	 q
		 ‘Did Ahmet go to the cinema (or didn’t he)?’ (Kornfilt 2003:â•›8)
In Turkish the A-not-A-construction is optional and, when used, combines with the
question particle (which is not optional).
A few languages in Dryer’s (2011s) database, 15 (1.6%) to be exact, have both ques-
tion particles and an interrogative verb morphology. Kashmiri, for example, has a
question particle k’a: and a verbal interrogative suffix â•‚a:, which may either occur
alone or together.
		 Kashmiri (Indo-European (Indic): Pakistan, India)
	 (327)	 (k’a:)	 tsɨ	 gatsh-kh-a:	 paga:h	 garɨ
		 q	 2sg	 go-2sgps-q	 tomorrow	 home
		 ‘Will you go home tomorrow?’  (Wali & Koul 1997:â•›5)
One single language in Dryer’s database, Chalcatongo Mixtec, lacks any kind of dif-
ferentiation between statements and polar questions.
		 Chalcatongo Mixtec (Oto-Manguean (Mixtecan): Mexico)
	 (328)	 n̄ábaʔa=ró	 librú=ro
		 have=2	 book=2
		 ‘You have your book.’ / ‘Do you have your book?’  (Macaulay 1996:â•›126)
The utterance in (328) can be interpreted either as a statement or a question; there is
no overt marking and no intonational difference between the meanings. It is safe to
assume that this is extremely rare cross-linguistically.
12.1.2.2â•‡ Content questions
Content questions (also called question-word questions, information questions,
wh-questions192 and constituent interrogatives) contain an interrogative phrase and
demand a specific answer containing other information than just a confirmation or
nonconfirmation. In other words, a simple Yes or No is not an adequate answer to a
content question. An example of a content question is What are you reading?, where
the answer would have to give specific information, such as, for example, Shakespeare
192.â•‡ The term wh-questions derives from the fact that many of the English questions words start
with whâ•‚ in writing: who(m), what, where, why, when, which (but cf. how, which is also a question
word). However, this only reflects English and while it may be useful as a mnemonic device for
speakers and students of English, it is not very useful for cross-linguistic purposes.
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 357
or The book about moths or something similar. An interrogative phrase may consist
of only a question word (e.g. What are you reading?) but may also consist of more than
that, as in Which book are you reading now? or Which of the new books will you be tak-
ing along? where the question word plus the noun phrase (which book and which of the
new books respectively) constitute the interrogative phrase.
The interrogative phrase replaces the constituent asked about, thereby indicat-
ing what kind of information is being requested. Thus the subject in a declarative like
JohnS read the book is, in a corresponding content question, replaced by the interroga-
tive phrase who: WhoS read the book? Likewise, the object may be inquired about, as in
WhatO did John read? Notice that the interrogative phrase in English is by default in sen-
tence initial position, leaving a “gap” where the relevant constituent would have been in
a declarative sentence (compare John read [the detective story]O with [What]O did John
read ___ ?). This movement of the constituent to sentence initial position is sometimes
called fronting. To require the interrogative phrase to be in sentence initial position, as
English does, is rather common cross-linguistically: of 901 languages in Dryer’s (2011u)
database on the position of the interrogative phrase, 264 (29.3%) obligatorily place it
sentence initially. Much more common, however, is to allow the interrogative phrase
to occur elsewhere in the sentence. This is true for 614 languages (68.1%) in Dryer’s
database, such as Dumi, where the interrogative phrase is in the same position as the
constituent asked about would have been in a declarative sentence.
		 Dumi (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): Nepal)
	 (329)	 a.	 an-a	 mwo:	 a-dzɨ-t-a
			 2sg-erg	 what	 ms-eat-npst-23S

		 b.	 khi:bɨ-ʔa	 aŋ	 a-ka:ts-ə
			 dog-erg	 1sg	 ms-bite-1sg
			 S	 O	 V
			 ‘The dog bit me.’  (van Driem 1993:â•›62,â•›86)
The question word mwo: ‘what’ in (329a) is an object and placed in the same position as
an object in a declarative sentence (b). In most of the languages that allow the interrog-
ative phrase in other positions than sentence initial the interrogative phrase occupies
the same position as the equivalent constituent would in a declarative sentence; it re-
mains in situ.193 The remaining 23 (2.6%) languages in Dryer’s database exhibit a mixed
behaviour, in that some interrogative phrases occur sentence initially and some do not.
193.â•‡ Notice, however, that sentence initial position of an interrogative phrase may also be a case of
in situ if that is where the constituent would be in declarative sentences, as is the case in English if
the interrogative phrase is a subject.
358	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
All known languages have a set of words that are used for content questions, but
not all languages have specific question words. In Wari’, for example, a content ques-
tion is formed by placing a form of the demonstrative ma’ in initial position and leav-
ing a corresponding gap in the clausal syntax.
		 Wari’ (Chapacura-Wanhan (Chapacura-Wanhan): Brazil)
	 (330)	 a.	 ma’			 co	 pa’	 nana	 hwam	 pain
			 that.prox.hearer	 infl.m/f.rp	 kill	 3pl.rp	 fish	 prep.3n
			 S				 V		 O
			 xec	 ca’	 ne
			 day	 this.n	 rec.past
			 ‘Who killed fish this morning?’
		 b.	 mam	 wac	 ‘ina-on	 hwam	 pain	 quit
			 inst	 cut	 1sg.rp-3sm	 fish	 prep.3n	 knife
				 V	 S	 O
			 ‘I cut the fish with the knife.’  (Everett & Kern 1997:â•›18,â•›25)
The basic word order of Wari’ is VSO (as shown in Example (330b)). Content ques-
tions are formed by fronting the demonstrative ma’ ‘that (proximal to hearer)’ with a
corresponding inflection morpheme (in this case co). However, since content ques-
tions in Wari’ are by default formed by fronting the demonstrative, it may still be
argued that it has a specific set of words characteristic for content questions.
Typical question words are interrogative pronouns (such as who or what), inter-
rogative adverbs (such as where or how), interrogative determiners (such as which),
interrogative quantifiers (such as French combien ‘how.many’), and so on. Languages
may also have interrogative verbs, that is, verbs that in themselves function as a ques-
tion word. Lavukaleve is an example of such a language:
		 Lavukaleve (Solomons East Papuan (Lavukaleve): Solomons Islands)
	 (331)	 me-kalem	 vasia-m
		 2pl-father(m)	 be.where-sg.m
		 ‘Where is your(pl) father?’  (Terrill 1999:â•›413)
The verb vasia ‘be.where’ in (331) is in itself a question word, not properly translatable
into English, since English does not have interrogative verbs. The semantics of inter-
rogative verbs is often something like ‘be.who/what’ or ‘do.what’/‘what.happened’ but
may also be something like ‘be/do.how’, ‘say.what’ and ‘be/go.where’. For more on the
typology of interrogative verbs, see Hagège (2008). An unusual question word mean-
ing ‘which part of X’s body’ can be found in Toqabaqita:
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 359
		 Toqabaqita (Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands)
	 (332)	 tafa-mu			 n-e			 fii
		 which.part.of.body-2sg.pers	 foc-3sg.nfut	 hurt
		 ‘Which part of your body hurts?’ or ‘Where (in your body) does it hurt?’
 (Lichtenberk 2007:â•›604)
The strategies for deriving polar questions discussed above are often also used with
content questions. However, with content questions these strategies tend to be op-
tional rather than obligatory. Furthermore, content questions generally do not allow
tags or A-not-A-constructions.
12.1.3		 Imperatives
All known languages have some kind of strategy for expressing directive speech acts,
or imperatives, i.e. speech acts meant to get the addressee to perform some kind of
action. Imperatives are typically used to issue commands (Sit down!), requests (Please
switch off the light.), entreaties (Let me try it out!), advice (Don’t bike without a hel-
met!), warnings (Watch out for the dog!), instructions (Stir a spoonful of port in the
sauce.), wishes (Have fun!), and so on. Imperatives may be positive or negative, in that
the former directs the addressee towards an action that should be done, while the lat-
ter prohibits the addressee from an action. For a very detailed study on the forms and
functions of imperatives and commands, see Aikhenvald (2010), which this section
relies heavily on.
12.1.3.1â•‡ Positive imperatives
Positive imperatives, usually simply termed imperatives, are used to initiate action. In
addition to the different morphological strategies for marking imperatives discussed
in 8.5.3.1, it should be noted that some languages, such as Abkhaz, make a gender dis-
tinction in singular imperatives.
		 Abkhaz (Northwest Caucasian (Northwest Caucasian): Georgia)
	 (333)	 a.	 w-c’a		 (male addressee)
			 m-go
			 ‘Go!’
		 b.	 b-c’a		 (female addressee)
			 f-go
			 ‘Go!’
		 c.	 šw-c’a		 (plural addressees)
			 pl-go
			 ‘Go!’  (Wolfgang Schulze, p.c.)
360	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (333) the imperative takes a gender dependent prefix in the singular (wâ•‚ ‘masculine’
and bâ•‚ ‘feminine’ respectively). This distinction is, however, neutralized in the plural,
as shown in (333c). In Tashlhiyt the gender distinction appears in the plural but not in
the singular. This is very rare cross-linguistically.
		 Tashlhiyt (Afro-Asiatic (Berber): Morocco)
	 (334)	 a.	 du:		 (said to one male or female addressee)
			 ‘Go!’
		 b.	 du:-iat	 (said to more than one male addressee)
			 go-m.pl
			 ‘Go!’
		 c.	 du:-iamt	 (said to more than one female addressee)
			 go-f.pl
			 ‘Go!’  (Applegate 1955:â•›42)
Some Siouan languages make gender distinctions in the choice of imperative marker
based on the sex of the speaker (not of the addressee). Biloxi (Siouan (Siouan): USA),
a language that went extinct in the 1930s, is claimed to have had a spectacular set of
imperative markers, although it may be that the number of markers it is claimed to
have had is somewhat exaggerated (see Einaudi 1974:â•›88ff for a discussion). At the very
minimum there were three different imperative markers as well as a zero marker. For
plural addressees the additional number marker (a-) â•‚tu was used.
		 Biloxi (Siouan (Siouan): USA)
	 (335)	 a.	 -ta: male speaker to male addressee(s)
			 eyąhį-ta	 (single addressee)	 a-dǫx-tu-ta	 (plural addressees)
			 come-imp.m/m				 pl-look-pl-imp.m/m
			 ‘Come!’						 ‘Look!’
		 b.	 -di: male speaker to female addressee(s)
			 umaki-di
			 bathe-imp.m/f
			 ‘Bathe!’
		 c.	 -te: female speaker to male addressee(s)
			 toho-te					 dǫx-tu-te
			 lie.down-imp.f/m		 look-pl-imp.f/m
			 ‘Lie down!’				 ‘Look!’
		 d.	 Ø: female speaker to female addressee or male/female speaker to child
			 handa
			 stay.imp.Ø
			 ‘Stay here!’  (Einaudi 1974:â•›88ff)
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 361
Example (335) shows various forms of imperatives in Biloxi which take different
markers depending on the sex of the person issuing the command. Thus â•‚ta is used if
a male is commanding one or more other males, â•‚di is used if a male is commanding
one or more females and â•‚te is used if a female is commanding one or more males.
With plural addressees the plural marker â•‚tu appears before the imperative marker
(as shown in Example (335a and c); the former also contains the plural prefix a-). The
zero marker is commonly found and seems to have been used for issuing commands
to children and from female speakers to one or more female addressees.194
Abkhaz is interesting in that it has an ergative alignment pattern for imperatives.
In Example (333) above we have an intransitive verb c’a ‘go’, where the agreement is
with the S (the one who is to perform the action). With transitive verbs, however, we
get agreement with the P with the prefix dâ•‚ for animates and yâ•‚ for inanimates:
		 Abkhaz (Northwest Caucasian (Northwest Caucasian): Georgia)
	 (336)	 a.	 y-ga			 (single addressee)
			 inanimP-take
			 ‘Take (it)!’
		 b.	 d-ga			 (single addressee)
			 animP-take
			 ‘Take (him/her)!’
		 c.	 y-žw-ga			 (plural addressees)
			 inanimP-pl-take
			 ‘Take (it)!’  (Wolfgang Schulze, p.c.)
In (336a and b) the agreement in the singular imperatives is with the P and not the
A, since the agreement marker denotes what kind of animacy the P has, and not, for
example, the gender of the person meant to carry out the action. The pattern is there-
fore an ergative one: the alignment is between S and P. Notice that this does not carry
over to the plural, since in the plural the verb is marked for all central arguments: the
S with intransitive verbs and both the A and the P with transitive verbs, as shown in
(336c). Alignment was discussed in 9.1.3.
In some languages, such as Welsh, a subset of verbs marks the imperative with a
suppletive form.
194.â•‡ Baloxi also had gender sensitive markers for other sentence types: for example, declarative
clauses carried the optional markers â•‚na (if the speaker was male) and â•‚ni (if the speaker was fe-
male), while interrogative clauses carried the obligatory markers â•‚wo (if the speaker was male) and
â•‚∅ (if the speaker was female). See further Einaudi (1974:â•›79ff).
362	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Welsh (Indo-European (Celtic): UK)
	 (337)					 singular addressee		 plural addressees
		 mynd ‘to go’		 dos (N)/cer (S) ‘go!’		 ewch (N)/cerwch (S) ‘go!’
 (King 1996:â•›226)
The verb mynd ‘go’ takes a suppletive form both in the singular and in the plural im-
perative; the two forms differ between the northern and the southern dialects (N and
S respectively). Notice that there is no other number marking for the imperative than
the choice of suppletive form. If a language has suppletive imperatives, it is likely that
it is for basic motion verbs such as ‘come’ and ‘go’ (Veselinova 2006:â•›139).
Languages may have different imperative markers depending on aspect, remote-
ness, distance, direction or evidentiality. Lavukaleve, for example, has two sets of im-
perative markers in three numbers (singular, dual and plural), for the perfective and
imperfective aspects respectively.
		 Lavukaleve (Solomons East Papuan (Lavukaleve): Solomons Islands)
	 (338)				 perfective		 imperfective
		 singular	 -va		 -ma
		 dual		 -ila		 -mela
		 plural		 -iva		 -ba
		 a.	 iru-ma
			 sleep-ipfv.imp.sg
			 ‘Sleep!’
		 b.	 iru-va
			 sleep-pfv.imp.sg
			 ‘Shut your eyes!’  (Terrill 1999:â•›311f)
While some verbs in Lavukaleve are incompatible with only one of the sets of impera-
tive markers due to the actionality of the verb (for instance, ngoa ‘stay’ can only take
the imperfective markers while foa ‘go.down’ can only take the perfective markers),
others may take either set, which, in turn, affects the translation of the command.
Thus iru ‘sleep’ translates into the command ‘shut your eyes’ when marked with the
perfective imperative endings, as shown in (338b).
Some languages have a special ‘delayed’ or ‘remote’ imperative (sometimes also
called a future imperative), which contrasts with the direct imperative.
		 Tucano (Tucanoan (Tucanoan): Colombia, Brazil)
	 (339)	 a.	 ba’á-ya
			 eat-imp
			 ‘Eat!’ (now)
		 b.	 ba’á-apa
			 eat-fut.imp
			 ‘Eat!’ (later)  (West 1980:â•›51)
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 363
In Tucano the imperative suffix indicates whether the action has to be carried out
immediately ((339a)) or only at some point in the future ((339b)). Very often this ‘de-
layed’ or future imperative is considered a politer form of command.
Many Cariban languages have different imperatives depending on motion distinc-
tions. Tiriyo, for example, has three different sets of markers for two sets of numbers:
		 Tiriyo (Cariban (Cariban): Suriname, Brazil)
	 (340)					 singular addressee	 collective addressee
		 stative			 -(kë)	 -tëkë
		 allative (motion away)	 -ta		 -tatë
		 venitive (motion to)	 -mïī	 -mïīko(mo)
		 a.	 apëh-kë
			 3o:catch-stative.imp.sg
			 ‘Catch it!’
		 b.	 papa=pa		 i-wa-ta
			 2:father=rpt	 3obj-fetch-all.imp.sg
			 ‘Go get your father!’
		 c.	 epë-e=mïī
			 bathe-rpt=ven.imp.sg
			 ‘Come bathe!’  (Meira 1999:â•›319ff)
The stative imperative does not imply any motion, while the allative imperative im-
plies motion away from and the venitive implies motion towards the speaker. The al-
lative imperative in Tiriyo is also what may be termed a ‘distal imperative’: the action
has to be carried out elsewhere than where the order was given.
Languages may have different imperative markers depending on the evidential-
ity of the command. In Tariana (Arawakan (Arawakan): Brazil), for example, an im-
perative uttered by one person may be repeated by another person, but then only as a
second-hand command ((341a)). Also, imperatives of warning (‘apprehensives’) take a
different form depending on whether the addressee can see the danger or not.
		 Tariana (Arawakan (Arawakan): Brazil)
	 (341)	 a.	 pi-n̄ha-pida
			 2sg-eat-sec.imp
			 ‘Eat!’ (Eat-(as)-you.were-told-to.)
		 b.	 pi-na	 di-pasya-da
			 2sg-obj	 3sgnf-squash-vis.appreh
			 ‘(Beware, a car) might squash you.’ (You are walking in the middle of the road
and can see it.)
		 c.	 pi-wha-n̄hina
			 2sg.obj-fall-appreh.nonvis
			 ‘You might fall down.’ (You are not looking.)  (Aikhenvald 2010:â•›138,â•›141)
364	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
In (341a) an order previously given by person A is repeated by person B (a second-
hand command). In (341b) the addressee is being warned about a danger s/he can see
while in (341c) the addressee is being warned about a danger that neither speaker nor
addressee can see.
12.1.3.2â•‡ Negative imperatives
All known languages have a way of commanding someone not to do something, but
how this is expressed may differ. Negative imperatives, or prohibitives, are the device
used to tell someone not to carry out an action. An example of a prohibitive is Don’t
touch that! where the addressee is commanded to refrain from doing something (in
this case touching the item in question).
Of the 495 languages in van der Auwera & Lejeune’s (2011b) database on pro-
hibitives, 113 (or 22.8%) form a prohibitive by way of the positive imperative and the
normal negative, that is, there is no special form for the prohibitive. Maithili is an
example of such a language.
		 Maithili (Indo-European (Indic): India, Nepal)
	 (342)	 a.	 j-o
			 go-imp(2nh)
			 ‘Go!’
		 b.	 nəi	 j-o
			 neg	 go-imp(2nh)
			 ‘Don’t go!’  (Yadav 1996:â•›284,â•›289)
In (342) the imperative is formed by using a person/number dependent imperative
verb ending, while the prohibitive is formed by simply adding the ordinary negator
to the imperative clause. English also falls into this category of languages, as shown in
the translations above; however, for the prohibitive English requires the auxiliary do
to be added to the clause.
Somewhat more common than this strategy is to form prohibitives with the
positive imperative plus a special negative. This is found in 182 languages (36.8%)
in van der Auwera & Lejeune’s database. Purépecha is an example of such a lan-
guage, where the negative for prohibitives is ášɨ while the negative for other sen-
tence types is nó:
		 Purépecha (Tarascan (Tarascan): Mexico)
	 (343)	 a.	 á-Ø	 í-ni	 awárdienti
			 drink-imp.2	 dem-obj	 wine
			 ‘Drink this wine!’
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 365
		 b.	 ášɨ	 xwá-Ø-rini	 sáni
			 neg	 bring-imp.2-obj	 few
			 ‘Don’t bring me few!’
		 c.	 xí	 nó	 thirí-ša-ka
			 1sg	 neg	 eat-prog-ass.1
			 ‘I am not eating.’  (Chamoreau 1998:â•›59–60)
The imperative marker â•‚Øâ•‚ remains the same for both positive and negative impera-
tives ((343a and b)), but the negation differs between negative imperatives and nega-
tive declaratives ((343b and c)).
Another fairly common strategy is to have a special negator for prohibitives and
a form of the verb that is different from positive imperatives, found in 145 languages
(29.3%) in van der Auwera & Lejeune’s sample. In Lango, for example, the prohibitive
is formed by using a special negative and the subjunctive mood (not the imperative)
for the verb:
		 Lango (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Uganda)
	 (344)	 a.	 dǎc
			 2sg.drop.imp
			 ‘Drop (it)!’
		 b.	 kʊ̆r	 ìdǎc
			 neg	 2sg.drop.subj
			 ‘Don’t drop (it)!’
		 c.	 án	 àpé	 àwótò	 Kàmpálà
			 1sg	1sg.neg	 1sg.go.pfv	K.
			 ‘I didn’t go to Kampala.’  (Noonan 1992:â•›142–3)
In (344a) the clause is in imperative mode, marked with a zero morpheme. In (344b) the
clause is a prohibitive and therefore takes the special negative kʊ̆r ‘not’, but the verb is
the subjunctive mode rather than the imperative. The negator for other sentence types
than prohibitives is pé (plus the person/number inflection), as shown in (344c).195 It
should be noted that van der Auwera & Lejeune have included in this category languag-
es with pure prohibitive markers, that is, markers that specifically denote prohibition,
which seems to be a rather rare phenomenon. In König & Siemund’s (2007) database
of 70 languages, only four of them (Lezgian, Macushi, Malayalam and Warekena) have
specific prohibitive markers. Kayardild, which is not in König & Siemund’s sample, is
an example of such a language:
195.â•‡ It could be argued, however, that the Lango imperative is actually a suffixless subjunctive. See
Noonan (1992:â•›143).
366	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 Kayardild (Australian (Tangkic): Australia)
	 (345)	 a.	 duura-tha	 ngad
			 poke-imp	 1sg.nom
			 ‘Poke me!’
	 	 b.	 duura-na		 ngad
			 poke-prohib196	 1sg.nom
			 ‘Don’t poke me!’  (Evans 1995:â•›256)
As Example (345) shows, the positive imperative in Kayardild is expressed with the
suffix â•‚tha, while the negative imperative (prohibitive) is expressed with the suffix â•‚na.
The fourth and smallest group of languages (55 languages or 11.1%) in van der
Auwera & Lejeune’s sample form prohibitives by using the same negator as for other
sentence types, but a verb form that differs from the positive imperative. Italian is an
example of such a language for the singular imperative:
		 Italian (Indo-European (Romance): Italian)
	 (346)	 a.	 parl-a!
			 speak.2sg.imp
			 ‘Speak!’
		 b.	 non	 parl-are!
			 neg	 speak.ind
			 ‘Don’t speak!’
		 c.	 non	 parl-i	 bene
			 neg	 speak-2sg.pres	 well
			 ‘You don’t speak well.’  (source: personal knowledge)
In (346a) the verb takes the imperative personal ending, but in the prohibitive in (346b)
the verb is in the indicative. The negator non is the same as in a declarative sentence,
as shown in (346c).
The figures in WALS are minimally affected once the five contact languages have
been subtracted, four of which (Angolar (Creole (Portuguese-lexified): São Tomé &
Príncipe), Naga Pidgin (Creole (Assamese-lexified): India), Ndyuka and Sango) form
the prohibitive by way of the normal imperative and the normal negative, while the
fifth (Ma’a/Mbugu) has a special imperative and a special negative for prohibitives.
The pattern for prohibitives differs quite considerably among the APiCS languages, as
shown in Table 12.1.

It thus seems that that pidgin and creole languages are more likely than non-creole
languages to form prohibitives with a positive imperative plus the normal negative.
12.2	 Politeness
At all times when people interact, identities and senses of selves are jostling for at-
tention. A central concept in pragmatics is the concept of face, that is, the public
self-image that we all want to maintain (a term ultimately derived from the English
expression ‘to lose face’, see Brown & Levinson (1987 [1978]:â•›61). There are two aspects
to the concept of face, the negative face, which basically denotes the need to be in-
dependent and free from imposition, and the positive face, which, very simplified,
denotes the need to belong and be accepted.
[F]ace is something that is emotionally invested, and that can be lost, maintained, or
enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction. In general, people coop-
erate (and assume each other’s cooperation) in maintaining face in interaction, such
cooperation being based on the mutual vulnerability of face […] since people can be
expected to defend their faces if threatened, and in defending their own to threaten
others’ faces. (Brown & Levinson 1987 [1978]:â•›61)
Politeness is a way of interaction which shows awareness of and respect for someone
else’s face. A face threatening act is an act that threatens the integrity and self-image
of another person. For example, giving someone a direct order such as Sit down and
be quiet! implies having social power over that person. It is acceptable for a parent
197.â•‡ The language with value 4 is Ma’a/Mbugu. For two APiCS languages there is no dominant
strategy: in Chinese Pidgin Russian it is equally common to form the prohibitive with the positive
imperative and the ordinary negative as it is to form it with the positive imperative and a special
negative. In Pichi it is equally common to form the prohibitive with the positive imperative and the
normal negative as it is to form it with a different form of the verb and the normal negative. Data is
missing for two languages (Batavia Creole and Yimas-Arafundi Pidgin).
368	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
to give his or her child a direct order, but giving a direct order to your colleague or
neighbour is in general a face threatening act and therefore not acceptable. Converse-
ly, if we act or behave in a way that lessens a possible threat to another person’s face,
we engage in a face saving act. If, for example, you wish to get on with the meeting
and that your colleague would stop roaming about the room talking on his mobile
phone, you might convey this by using an indirect speech act like Right, should we sit
down and continue? where the question removes the assumption of social power (for
instance, by implying that the addressee has the theoretical option to answer however
he pleases) and therefore maintains the balance of face.
This section will give a very brief sketch of how indirect speech acts differ from
direct speech acts, as well as mention some ways in which languages have gram-
maticalized politeness. It is beyond the scope of this section to give a comprehensive
discussion of all the aspects involved in the study of linguistic politeness. For a very
accessible introduction to the topic of linguistic politeness, see Watts (2003). A clas-
sic piece of work, around which much discussion has centred, is Brown & Levinson
(1987 [1978]).
12.2.1		 Indirect speech acts
Speech acts may be either direct or indirect. In a direct speech act the content of
the utterance matches the speaker’s intention of the utterance. Thus the declarative is
simply a statement uttered with the purpose of giving information, while the interrog-
ative is simply a question uttered with the purpose of getting information and the im-
perative is simply a command with the purpose of getting someone to do something.
In other words, when we engage in direct speech acts, we mean what we say. The
sentence types discussed in 12.1 were all direct speech acts. However, as mentioned,
social situations involve complex structures of cooperation: we might want to achieve
something, but we also have to take into account that we are surrounded by others
whom we do not want to offend. As mentioned above, giving someone a direct com-
mand, for example, implies that we either have power over or are very intimate with
that person (or both). This may or may not be a useful social strategy to engage in,
depending on the situation. A parent can pretty safely issue a direct command to his
or her child while the child still lives at home. A military commander can pretty safely
issue a direct command to a soldier. There might be situations where close friends
can give each other direct commands. But it is rarely useful for an employee to give a
direct command to his or her boss, or for a host to order his or her guests about (or the
guests the host, for that matter). Therefore we engage in various politeness strategies.
One way to save someone’s negative face, is, for example, to show concern about
imposition. If we want help from somebody, we might phrase the request with an
initial face saving phrase, such as Excuse me, … or I’m sorry to bother you, … or
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 369
Â�
something similar. A way of saving someone’s positive face would be, for example,
to increase the sense of group belonging. One common strategy for that in English is
to use an inclusive we, thereby reducing the request into a common act. An example
of this would be the indirect speech act mentioned above (Right, should we sit down
and continue?), where the pronoun we gives a tone of group belonging, even though
there is only one intended addressee. There’s a fine balance to these kinds of strategies
though: an inclusive we can very easily sound ironic and get a superior tone, thereby
becoming a face threatening rather than face saving device.198
A very common face saving device is to use the aforementioned indirect speech
acts to achieve our purposes. In an indirect speech act the content of the utterance
does not correspond to the speaker’s intention of the utterance. We may, for example,
utter a question or a statement, but the real purpose of the utterance is to get some-
one to do something for us (i.e. it is an indirect command). In other words, when
we engage in indirect speech acts, we actually do not mean exactly what we say. For
instance, if a stranger carrying a pile of books asks you Do you know where the library
is? you are likely to interpret the question as a command (Tell me where the library is)
and answer it by giving directions on how to get there, rather than take it as a direct
interrogative speech act and answer something like Yes, thank you, I know where it is.
Likewise, if you and your friend are about to get into a car and the friend utters the
declarative sentence The door on this side is locked, you are likely to interpret that as an
indirect command (Open the door for me), rather than just file it as a piece of informa-
tion and drive off. It is very common for speakers to use declaratives and interroga-
tives as politely disguised requests (or commands).
There is always room for misunderstanding between individuals and cultures when
it comes to interpreting speech acts. What one person might find a clear case of an in-
direct command, the other might find a clear case of a direct speech act. What is polite
for one person might not be for the other, and so on. For instance, the individual who
has been raised to never directly ask for something might, when having dinner with
colleagues, ask her neighbour Would you like some more potatoes? in the expectation
that the neighbour will then ask her the same question (to which she can then safely
say yes). If the neighbour, however, does not consider it impolite to ask for something,
s/he might not understand the question as an indirect speech act, and might therefore
simply answer No, thank you, in which case there has been a miscommunication. This
is of course especially true for clashes between people of different cultures.
198.â•‡ The so-called ‘medical we’ is especially famous for this, where a nurse or a doctor uses the first
person plural pronoun when actually addressing the patient, such as Have we taken our medicines,
then? or How are we today? which is actually in many situations considered patronizing. See, for
example, Wales (1996:â•›63ff).
370	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
12.2.2		 Honorifics
Many languages grammaticalize various politeness strategies (for more on grammati-
calization, see 13.1). Honorifics can, very simplified, be thought of as linguistic po-
liteness devices, or devices for marking social distinction (so-called ‘social deixis’).
Following Brown & Levinson (1987 [1978]) and Levinson (1983) I will distinguish be-
tween three types of honorifics depending on the relationship between the speaker
and others: the referent honorifics, which have to do with the relationship between
the speaker and things or persons referred to; addressee honorifics, which have to do
with the relationship between the speaker and the addressee; and bystander honorif-
ics, which have to do with the relationship between the speaker and the ‘bystanders’
or overhearers (covering such things as audiences as well as bystanders who are not
participants of the interaction).199
12.2.2.1â•‡ Referent honorifics
With a referent honorific the politeness or respect distinctions are conveyed by re-
ferring to the target of the respect, that is, the choice of the linguistic form is depen-
dent on what is referred to. A well-known instance of referent honorifics is the choice
of pronoun when addressing a person. In European languages it is very common to
have a binary distinction of politeness, where one form is considered familiar and
the other polite, as in the French distinction tu/vous, both of which refer to a single
person. This binary distinction in pronouns of address is often called T/V pronouns,
after the Latin tu ‘you.sg.nom’ and vos ‘you.pl.nom’. In his sample of 207 languages
on politeness distinctions in second person pronouns, Helmbrecht (2011) found that
49 languages (23.7%) make use of this kind of binary distinction, many of which clus-
ter in Europe. It should be noted here, however, that this figure comprises languages
with vastly different levels of T/V pronoun usage. In German, for example, the polite
form Sie is the standard form of address between adults who are not in a close social
relation. In Swedish, however, which is also listed as having a binary politeness dis-
tinction, this is not the case. While it is imaginable to use the plural pronoun form ni
to address a single person, the context would be highly marked indeed. The default
mode of address between adults who don’t know each other is with the singular (‘in-
formal’) du. Having Swedish as one of my mother tongues, I would, in fact, be hard
put to find a situation where using the plural (‘formal’) ni to address a single person
199.â•‡ Brown & Levinson (1987 [1978]) and Levinson (1983) have a fourth social deixis axis, that of
the setting, where the formality of the language the speaker uses is dependent on the setting where
the utterance takes place. As this concerns formality levels and not honorifics, it will not be dealt
with further here.
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 371
would feel adequate and that would not convey an awkward, almost ironic tone. The
usage of universal du in Swedish is a rather recent phenomenon and, interestingly
enough, it seems that the language might be changing back to making politeness
distinctions. The generation born in the later 1980s, and even more so those born in
the 1990s, find ni-usage more acceptable than those of us born in the 1970s or before
(Charlotta Busing, p.c.).
Some languages, 15 (7.2%) in Helmbrecht’s database, mainly clustered in South
Asia but also found elsewhere, use multiple politeness distinctions for the second per-
son pronoun. Nepali is an example of a language with three levels of politeness dis-
tinctions in the singular and two in the plural:
		 Nepali (Indo-European (Indic): Nepal)
	 (347)	 								 singular	 plural
		 low grade honorific (‘informal’)	 tã	 timī-haru
		 mid grade honorific (‘polite’)	 timī	 timī-haru
		 high grade honorific (‘superpolite’)	 tapāï	 tapāï-haru
 (Acharya 1991:â•›106)
In (347) we have three different forms for the second person pronoun in the singular
depending on the level of politeness, while the plural adopts the two politer forms and
adds a plural marker to them.
There are also languages where a pronoun is avoided for the sake of politeness, a
strategy sometimes termed ‘pronoun avoidance’. In these languages it may be con-
sidered face threatening to directly address a person, so other kinds of terms are used
instead, such as status and kinship terms or various kinds of titles, and so on. Seven
languages (3.4%) in Helmbrecht’s database make use of this kind of strategy, all of
them in East and Southeast Asia. In Indonesian, for example, kinship terms such as
saudara ‘sibling; relative of same generation’ function as an impersonal pronoun used
between speakers of the same generation (or by a speaker to somebody younger)
when they are not well acquainted, while such terms as bapak ‘father’ or ibu ‘mother’
are used as a respectful address to people older than the speaker and between adults
of marriable age. Furthermore, very often people will avoid using the pronoun even
when on an equal status level, and instead use the addressee’s name (effectively saying
something like ‘Does Tom want more tea?’ when addressing Tom) (Sneddon 1996:
161ff; see also Wallace 1983 for a discussion on the origins of Indonesian pronouns and
what that can tell us about cultural attitudes and ideology).
The majority of the languages in Helmbrecht’s database (136 of 207 or 65.7%),
however, do not make any politeness distinctions for the second person pronominals.
The languages in APiCS display an almost identical pattern, as shown in Table 12.2.

Pidgin and creole languages thus do not seem to behave differently from non-creoles
with respect to politeness distinctions in pronouns.
Notice that with referent honorifics, which pronoun politeness is a part of, the
choice of form is dependent on who or what is being referred to. With the second
person pronouns the referent and the target happen to be the same. But we may also
have honorific distinctions in the third person. In Korean, for example, the choice of
the third person pronoun is dependent on what is being referred to and what level of
politeness is required:
		 Korean (Isolate: N, S Korea)
	 (348)	 3rd person			 singular		 plural
		 thing				 d-kes ‘it’		 d-kes-tul ‘they’
		 child				 d-ay ‘s/he’		 d-ay-tul ‘they’
		 adult: familiar			 d-salam ‘s/he’		 d-salam-tul ‘they’
		 adult: blunt			 d-i ‘s/he’		 d-i-tul ‘they’
		 adult: polite			 d-pun ‘s/he’		 d-pun-tul ‘they’  (Sohn 2001:â•›207)
In (348) we have the third person pronoun singular and plural, which consists of
the definite demonstrative form (noted as d here) plus the relevant suffixes. While
Korean makes an animate/inanimate distinction, just as English does (it versus s/he),
the choice of the suffixes for the animate referents are not dependent on gender, as
in English, but on social deixis, or politeness. Thus a child is referred to with the de-
monstrative plus the suffix â•‚ay, while an adult is referred to with the demonstrative
200.â•‡ For the purpose of comparison between APiCS and WALS patterns, the creole languages in
the WALS sample have been taken out, which is why the figure for WALS differ slightly here from
those earlier in the text.

bacano. The languages for value 4 are Afrikaans, Diu Indo-Portuguese (Creole (Portuguese-lexified):

missing for Batavia Creole and Juba Arabic (Pidgin (Arabic-lexified): Sudan).
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 373
plus one of three available suffixes (â•‚salam, â•‚i, and â•‚pun). The choice of suffix for adult
referents depends on the level of politeness required. Compare this to English, where
a child and an adult will be referred to by the same pronoun (he or she) and where
there are no honorific distinctions at all (a family member will be referred to with the
same pronoun as a member of the Royal House of England). Notice, further, that Eng-
lish makes no distinctions whatsoever in the plural (everything translates into ‘they’).
12.2.2.2â•‡ Addressee honorifics
An addressee honorific system is one where the choice of the linguistic form is depen-
dent on the addressee of the utterance. Virtually any part of the linguistic system may
be affected by addressee honorific requirements. We have already seen that languages
may have morphologically variable forms depending on levels of politeness. This is
also found in verb forms, such as different kinds of imperatives carrying different kinds
of politeness connotations. We have seen that languages may make a distinction be-
tween immediate and distal imperatives, where the immediate imperative is a familiar
(or maybe even rude) command while the distal imperative is a polite command.
		 Epena Pedee (Choco (Choco): Colombia)
	 (349)	 a.	 pháta	 khó-tɨ
			 plantain	 eat-imp.pl
			 ‘Eat the plantain!’
		 b.	 thɨpɨ	 phua-phéda	 a-hi
			 firewood	 blow-pol.imp	 say-past
			 ‘He said, “you will have to fan the fire”.’  (Harms 1994:â•›129f)
In Epena Pedee the polite imperative, which receives its own morphological marking
(compare â•‚ti in (349a) with â•‚phéda in (349b)), indicates that the action is going to have
to be carried out at some point in the future. The distal nature of this kind of impera-
tive makes it less direct and therefore, logically, more polite.
Korean verbs are not only marked with TMA and sentence type affixes but also
a host of affixes relating to addressee honorifics. A simple statement like It is rain-
ing thus takes six different forms depending on the social relationship between the
speaker and the addressee:
		 Korean (Isolate: N, S Korea)
	 (350)	 plain	 pi	 ka	 o-n-ta
				 rain	 nm	 come-in-dc
		 intimate	 pi	 ka	 w-a
				 rain	 nm	 come-int
		 familiar	 pi	 ka	 o-ney
				 rain	 nm	 come-fml
374	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
		 blunt	 pi	 ka	 o-o
				 rain	 nm	 come-bln
		 polite	 pi	 ka	 w-a.yo
				 rain	 nm	 come-pol
		 deferential	 pi	 ka	 o-p-ni-ta
				 rain	 nm	 come-ah-in-dc
		 neutral	 pi	 ka	 o-t-a
				 rain	 nm	 come-in-dc
				 ‘It is raining.’  (Sohn 2001:â•›269)
Example (350) shows the six levels of politeness in Korean. The choice of level depends
on the level of intimacy between speaker and addressee. The plain level is used with
children, or to the speaker’s younger siblings, children and grandchildren (regardless
of age), to the speaker’s daughter-in-law and between adult friends who have been
friends since childhood. The intimate level (also called ‘half-talk style’) is used by
small children to any of their family members (including elders), to young students,
to the speaker’s son-in-law, and between adults whose friendship began when they
were young (children or teenagers). The familiar level is a bit more formal than the
intimate level and is used by male speakers to young adolescents or young adults (e.g.
college students), to the speaker’s son-in-law, or between close adults whose friend-
ship began in adolescence. The blunt level is authorative, such as utterances spoken
by bosses to subordinates. This level is gradually disappearing. The polite level is
the most widely used level and is basically the informal counterpart of the deferential
level. The polite level is used between close adults, but also in daily conversations
between distant adults or to superiors. The deferential level is a more formal coun-
terpart of the polite level. It is used between distant adults or to superiors, or in such
contexts as verbal news reports and formal announcements. The neutral level looks
like the plain level except with interrogatives and imperatives. It is used in quotatives,
in writing to general audiences (i.e. in books, articles and newspapers), and in writ-
ten exam instructions. There is also a seventh politeness level, the superpolite level,
which is now obsolete, but can be found in religious prayers, poems and occasionally
in extremely formal or deferential letters. See further Sohn (2001:â•›271ff).
‘humble we’
Rather than a ‘royal we’ (pluralis majestatis or ‘majestic plural’), where the first person plural
we is used to refer to the first person singular I, some languages employ a ‘humble we’: in
Sawu (Austronesian (Central Malayo-Polynesian): Indonesia) the first person plural inclusive
pronominal dii ‘we’ may be used as a polite or deferential form for ‘I’ (first person singular)
(Cysouw 2005:â•›218).
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 375
Some languages, such as Javanese, have a so-called ‘honorific register’, where the
choice of vocabulary is addressee honorific, i.e. the choice of which words to use for
an utterance is dependent on the relationship between the speaker and the address-
ee. There are three main speech levels: ngoko (informal), used only when speaking
to someone very familiar, madyô (semi-polite), used with people of an intermediate
level of familiarity, such as neighbours, and krômô (polite), used with distant adults.
A fourth type of vocabulary, a kind of “respect vocabulary”, may be used in connec-
tion with any of the other level types to convey an added level of respect. This fourth
type, the “respect vocabulary” has two subcategories, krômô inggél (lit. ‘high krômô’),
used for highly respected persons, and krômô andÌ£ap (lit. ‘humble krômô’), “used in
referring to any person’s actions towards a highly respected person” (Poedjosoedarmo
1968:â•›58). We may thus end up with five different words that translate the same way
into English, but that carry different levels of politeness.
		 Javanese (Austronesian (Javanese): Indonesia)
	 (351)	 ngoko	 madyô	 krômô	 krômô’ inggél	 krômô anḍap
		 akôn	 kèn		 kèngkèn/puréh	 ḍawoh	 ng-atur-i
		 ‘tell/ask to do something’  (Poedjosoedarmo 1968:â•›58)
In (351) there are five different words that all translate into the same thing in English,
but the choice of which is dependent on the level of respect the speaker wishes or is
obliged to show the addressee. There are then further distinctions in the choice of
grammatical affixes. The combination of vocabulary and affixes leads to nine differ-
ent levels of politeness. The three main speech level vocabularies have different sizes:
ngoko is the basic vocabulary which carries every kind of concept, krômô has about
850 words, krômô inggél has about 260 words, madyô has about 35 words and krômô
andÌ£ap has about 20 words (Myhill 1994:â•›75f).
12.2.2.3â•‡ Bystander honorifics
With bystander honorifics the linguistic form of the language is not dependent on
the speaker or on the addressee, but on who is within earshot of the utterance. That
is, it is not dependent on the relationship between the speaker and the addressee, nor
is it dependent on what is being referred to, but simply who can hear what is being
said. This therefore covers participants, such as audiences, as well as non-participants,
or ‘bystanders’. This is often termed ‘avoidance language’ or ‘honorific register’. Many
Australian languages had or have bystander honorifics to varying degrees. Dyirbal is
famous for having had two language variants, Guwal and Dyalŋuy. Guwal was used
in all circumstances except when certain ‘taboo relatives’ were present, in which case
Dyalŋuy had to be used.
376	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
No man or woman would closely approach or look at a taboo relative, still less speak di-
rectly to them. The avoidance language, Dyalŋuy, had to be used whenever a taboo rela-
tive was within earshot. The taboo was symmetrical – if X was taboo to Y so was Y to X.
Taboo relatives were:
[1]	
a parent-in-law of the opposite sex; and, by the symmetry rule, a child-in-law
of the opposite sex.
[2]	
a cross-cousin of the opposite sex – that is, father’s sister’s
or mother’s brother’s child. (Dixon 1972:â•›32)
Guwal and Dyalŋuy were identical phonologically and almost identical grammati-
cally, but differed completely in their vocabulary. To give an example:
		 Dyirbal (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia)
	 (352)	 Guwal		 Dyalŋuy
		 yanu(l)		 bawalbil		 ‘go’
		 buɽal		 ɲuɽimal		 ‘see, look at’
		 ɲalŋga		 ɲalmaru		 ‘child’
		 ɲinay		 maḑirabil		 ‘sit, stay, camp’  (Dixon 1972:â•›314)
While a number of languages may have ‘taboo relatives’, these are not necessarily
identical cross-culturally. Guugu Yimidhirr (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia)
also has an avoidance language that specifically involves the vocabulary and prosody
of the language. Here the taboo is especially strong between a man and his in-laws.
a man could not speak at all to his mother-in-law, remaining silent in her presence and
absenting himself when possible. With his father-in-law, his brothers-in-law and with
certain other relatives, a man was obliged to speak in a specially slow, soft, and respect-
ful tone of voice, and to substitute respectful equivalents for many common words.
 (Haviland 1979a:â•›32)
It should be noted that the overlap between the two vocabularies was not complete;
the basic, informal ‘everyday lexicon’ had more items than the ‘respectful lexicon’.
It was or is, however, still possible to express the same things in both varieties. This
was achieved by different methods of circumlocutions. In Guugu Yimidhirr, for ex-
ample, several ‘everyday language’ words translate into only one ‘respectful language’
(or ‘brother-in-law language’, as it was called) word:
		 Guugu Yimidhirr (Australian (Pama-Nyungan): Australia)
	 (353)	 everyday language	 brother-in-law language
		 dhadaa		 ‘go’	 balil ‘go’
		 dharmbil	 ‘float, sail, drift’
		 yaalgal		 ‘limp’
		 gaynydyarr	 ‘crawl’
		 biilil		 ‘paddle (canoe)’
		 …
(Haviland 1979b:â•›371)
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 377
In (353) several of the ‘everyday lexicon’ words translate into the same ‘respectful lexi-
con’ word. However, in both Guugu Yimidhirr and in Dyirbal, and presumably in
most languages that had or have an ‘avoidance language’, there was no limit to what
could be expressed in the ‘respectful language’. In Guugu Yimidhirr, for example, vari-
ous circumlocutions would be used to achieve the exact expression intended. For in-
stance, if someone specifically wanted to say ‘float’ in the respectful language, this was
done by the expression balil wabiirrbi (lit. go on water) and if someone wanted to say
‘limp’ in the respectful language, the expression would be dyirrun balil (lit. go badly),
and so on (Haviland 1979b).
Bystander honorifics do not have to be restricted to the lexicon. Waray (Aus-
tralian (Waray): Australia) also had an avoidance language, referred to as ‘sideways
language’, which was used with various in-law relatives and which involved adding a
suffix â•‚lawu to nominals and using the plural forms for verbs. There is no record of the
avoidance language involving any vocabulary suppletion (Harvey n.y.:â•›16).
		 Waray (Australian (Waray): Australia)
	 (354)	 nguk-lawu	 ban-ba-wu	 gan-a-ga-ng-u
		 tobacco-avoid	 1sg.obj-2pl.S-give	 irr-2pl.S-have-npst-dat
		 ‘Would you(pl) give me any tobacco if you(pl) have any? (addressed to one person)’
 (Harvey n.y.:â•›16)
In (354) the ‘sideways language’ demands the suffix â•‚lawu on the noun (nguk ‘tobacco’)
and that the verb is inflected in the plural even though the utterance only has a single
addressee. For more on avoidance from an anthropological point of view, see, for ex-
ample, Stasch (2003) and Pans (1998) with references.
12.3	 Speech acts in sign languages
Like spoken languages, all known sign languages have ways to carry out the basic
functions of giving information, gleaning information and issuing commands. The
declarative is typically the basic, unmarked sentence type. Negative declaratives are
typically made in two different ways: with negative particles, which are independent
signs, or with a negative intonation, which involves non-manual negative markers
that co-occur suprasegmentally with the sentence being signed. For a very thorough
discussion on negative constructions in sign languages, see Zeshan (2004a), which I
am relying heavily on.
Non-manual negatives are either formed through head movement or facial ex-
pressions. There are three main negative marking head movements cross-linguisti-
cally. The most common, maybe even universal, negative marking head movement
across sign languages is a repeated side-to-side head shake. This non-manual marker
378	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
is found in all sign languages in Zeshan’s (2004a) sample of 38 languages. The side-to-
side head shake may combine with other non-manual markers, such as facial expres-
sions, and may easily combine with manual signs. The second strategy, found in seven
of the languages in Zeshan’s sample, is to have a single side-ward head turn, where
the head is turned to one side and is then kept in that position for the duration of the
negation (although the syntactic distribution of this non-manual is more limited than
the side-to-side head shake). The third strategy involves a backward tilt of the head,
where the head is tilted backwards and remains in that position for the duration of the
negation. This is found in ENG, TİD and Lebanese Sign Language (LIB: Lebanon).202
Non-manual facial negators tend to be less grammaticalized and therefore less
systematic. They usually involve “negative” mimics, such as manipulating the eye-
brows (lowering or frowning, etc.), the eyes (narrowing or squinting, etc.), the mouth
(drawn down, pursed or spreading the lips, etc.) and the nose (e.g. wrinkling). Non-
manual facial negators tend to co-occur with the negative marking head movement.
In fact, in ST a non-manual facial negator without an accompanying negative head
movement would be interpreted as an expression of emotion or attitude, rather than
a grammatical negation (Ahlgren & Bergman 2006).
It is very common for sign languages to have a negative particle, that is, a separate
sign that functions as a negator. Neither the negative particles nor the non-manu-
al negative markers shape the signs being negated. That is, the negative particle or
non-manuals are simply added; the other signs remain the same as in an affirmative
declarative. Many sign languages also have so-called irregular negatives, where the
signs in the negative are not the same as in the affirmative (effectively suppletion). For
instance, the LIB signs for KNOW and NOT.KNOW look entirely different: KNOW
is formed by pointing the index finger to the side of the head (neutral expression),
while NOT.KNOW is formed by moving the flat open hand (palm in) from the mouth
towards the addressee (plus a non-manual facial negator), see Figure 12.1.
Irregularnegativestypicallyinvolvesignsofcognition(know/not.know,un-
derstand/not.understand, etc.), emotional attitude (want/not.want,
like/not.like, care/not.care, etc.), modality (can/not.can, must/not.
must, need/not.need, etc.), possession and existentials (have/not.have,
Â�exist/not.exist, get/not.get, etc.), tense and aspect (will/will.not, did/
did.not, finished/not.finished, etc.) and evaluation (right/not.right,
possible/not.possible, enough/not.enough, etc.) (Zeshan 2011a).
202.â•‡ A point worth noting is that the hearing population of the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as
Bulgaria, also use this as a negative gesture. However, as Zeshan (2004a:â•›11) points out, this negative
head gesture is found among hearing people in areas where the sign languages don’t have it, such as
among the hearing in Italy and Israel (but LIS and ISL do not have this negation head movement),
and is among the hearing population often accompanied by a click sound.

Most sign languages have several such irregular negatives. Of the 35 languages
in Zeshan’s (2011a) database on irregular negatives in sign languages, 21 (60%) have
more than five such irregular negatives. BSL, for instance, has at least eight:
		 BSL (Sign Language: UK)
	 (355)	 evaluation:		 NOT.GOOD
		 cognition:		 NOT.KNOW
		 emotional attitude:	 NOT.WANT;NOT.LIKE;NOT.AGREE;NOT.BELIEVE
		 possession:		 NOT.HAVE
		 tense:			 WILL.NOT (Deuchar 1987:â•›37)
Ten languages (28.6%) in Zeshan’s database have 2–5 irregular negatives. LIS, for ex-
ample, has four. Three languages (8.6%), the Indian dialect of IPSL, KK and LSE, have
only one irregular negative, while only one language (2.9%), the Karachi dialect of
IPSL, has none.

		 evaluation:		 NOT.POSSIBLE
		 emotional attitude:	 NOT.WANT; NOT.LIKE
		 (Brunelli 2006:â•›56)		 (Zeshan 2011a:â•›561)
Sign languages also have ways of forming polar questions and content questions. All
35 sign languages in Zeshan’s (2004b) database make use of non-manual signs for
polar questions. Typical non-manuals for polar questions are: raised eyebrows, wide
open eyes, eye contact with the addressee, head forward position and body forward
posture. Contrary to many spoken languages, syntactic changes to the clause (such

380	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
as change of word order) are not obligatory in the sign languages in Zeshan’s da-
tabase. There is, however, a tendency for questions containing pronouns to either
move the pronoun to sentence final position or to repeat the pronoun sentence
finally, as in TSL:
		 TSL (Sign Language: Thailand)
	 (357)	 a.	 __________pol.q
			 SMOKE INDEX2
			 ‘Do you smoke?’
		 b.	 _______________pol.q
			 INDEX2 DEAF INDEX2
			 ‘Are you deaf?’  (Zeshan 2004b:â•›21f)
In (357a) the personal pronoun (signed by pointing at the addressee) is moved to sen-
tence final position, while in (357b) the pronoun is repeated sentence finally.
Polar questions may also be formed with polar question particles; however, these
particles are always optional and always co-occur with the non-manual signs for
polar questions. Question particles tend to be used only for polar questions, but a
few sign languages, such as SV, also allow them for content questions. There are no
known sign languages where the question particle is used for content questions only,
or that have different particles for polar questions and content questions (Zeshan
2011b). In her database of 38 languages, Zeshan found that while the absolute major-
ity of languages (25 or 65.8%) lack question particles, about one third have at least
one. Nine languages (23.7%) have only one question particle, but four (10.5%), CSL,
HKSL, SKSL and TZS, have more than one. While the languages with more than one
question particle are all clustered in East Asia, those with one particle are spread over
the world, as Map 12.1 shows.
Sign languages form content questions by using a question word and non-man-
ual question signing. The non-manuals for content questions typically, but not uni-
versally, differ from the non-manuals for polar questions. The smallest paradigm
of question words is to have only one, basically a general WHAT/WHO sign, as in
IPSL (Zeshan 2003c:â•›201). Other sign languages have several question words, such as
ISL with six basic question words (WHO, what, how.many, where, from.
where/who, what’s.this) (Meir 2004:â•›99). Question words may appear either
sentence initially, sentence finally, or doubled (i.e. both at the beginning and the end
of the sentence). Many sign languages also allow content questions without any ques-
tion words, a phenomenon not found in spoken languages. This is typically done “by
facial expressions (non-manual marking) or by mouthing an imitation of the mouth
movements of a corresponding word from the spoken language” (Zeshan 2004b:â•›30).
	 Chapter 12.â•‡ Speech acts and politeness	 381
As mentioned in 8.6, sign languages tend to form imperatives either with particles or
morphological marking. Negative imperatives (prohibitives) are often formed with
irregular negation, that is, there is a special sign DO.NOT! marking prohibitives. This
contrasts to spoken languages, where pure prohibitive markers are relatively rare.
Politeness and face plays a role in sign languages just as in spoken languages. For
instance, indirect speech acts may be used to express wishes and commands, just as in
spoken languages. Various linguistic devices also occur. Examples of referent honorif-
ics can be found in the ASL pronominal system, where referencing to a person (first,
second or third) by ‘pointing’ with an open hand (with the fingers together and thumb
out) is a polite equivalent of the neutral pronominal signed by pointing with the index
finger (Baker-Shenk & Cokely 1991:â•›207). Another example of a referent honorific is
the honorific classifier in TİD. The classifier functions as the typical verbal classifiers
of sign languages, modifying the event sign according to the entity engaged in the
event. What is unique about this particular classifier is that it is specifically used as
a referent honorific. Thus the sign PERSON:COMING is signed with a raised index
classifier in neutral, non-honorific, contexts, but with a raised thumb classifier in hon-
orific contexts (Zeshan 2003a:â•›65). This has so far not been documented for any other
sign language.
Addressee honorifics also occur in sign languages, for instance with imperatives.
IPSL, for example, has a neutral imperative particle, KARO, and an impolite impera-
tive particle JA:O, which demands immediate action (Zeshan 2003c).

382	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
	 12.4â•‡ Summary
All languages are capable of fulfilling three basic functions: to give information, to request in-
formation and to issue commands. Any use of these three basic functions in interpersonal com-
munication constitutes a speech act. Speech acts may be direct or indirect. In direct speech acts
the meaning of the utterance matches the speaker’s intention of the utterance. In indirect speech
acts the semantic structure of the utterance does not correspond to the speaker’s intention of
the utterance.
There are three basic sentence types, declaratives, interrogatives and imperatives. Affirmative
declaratives are basic statements. Negative declaratives negate the truth value of a proposition.
Interrogatives are sentence types formed in order to glean information from the addressee
and may be either polar questions or content questions. Polar questions are questions to which
only a limited number of answers are acceptable, typically either Yes or No. Content questions
are questions which demand answers giving more specific information.
Imperatives are commands. Positive imperatives are formed with the purpose of getting
the addressee to do something, while negative imperatives, or prohibitives, are formed with the
purpose of getting the addressee to refrain from doing something.
Languages have different ways to uphold various politeness requirements. In most languag-
es indirect speech acts serve as a polite way of issuing commands. Many languages also gram-
maticalize politeness into various honorifics. Referent honorifics code the relationship between
the speaker and whatever or whoever is being referred to. Addressee honorifics code the rela-
tionship between the speaker and the addressee. Bystander honorifics code the type of linguistic
behaviour a speaker has to engage in depending on who is within earshot of the utterance.
Sign languages also have all three basic sentence types. Negative sentences are formed
primarily through non-manual head movement and often also with a co-occurring negative
particle. Most sign languages also have lexicalized irregular negatives. Interrogatives are typically
formed with non-manual facial signs. Polar questions may have a co-occurring question particle
and content questions typically have co-occurring questions words, although content questions
without question words are also allowed.
Sign languages also have politeness strategies. Indirect speech acts may be employed to
form polite requests, but morphological politeness distinctions can also be found, notably in
referent and addressee honorifics.

Language change
All languages change, either by way of internal or external factors or both. This chap-
ter will bring up a major factor of internal language change, grammaticalization (13.1).
I will give a brief overview of the processes involved in grammaticalization (13.1.1) and
the typical paths that have been identified for grammaticalization (13.1.2). I will also
very briefly mention the notion of unidirectionality (13.1.3). The principle external
cause for language change is contact between languages (13.2). I will first sketch the
sociolinguistic factors and mechanisms involved in contact-induced change (13.2.1),
before giving a short overview of what kinds of features tend to diffuse (13.2.2). In
13.2.3 I bring up the concept of linguistic areas and give some examples of the most
well-known ones. Section 13.3 gives a summary of some grammaticalization paths and
contact-induced changes in sign languages.
13.1	 Grammaticalization
There is one thing we know with absolute certainty: languages change. All languages
are constantly changing and any given description is, in a sense, merely a snapshot of
the language at the time of description. While different aspects of the linguistic sys-
tem in a language may change at different rates, they will all, over time, have changed
one way or another. The English that we speak and use today is different from that
in Shakespeare’s works, and is even more different from that in the Old English epic
Beowulf, and will be different from that of coming generations. Some features of the
English of Beowulf that, at the time, were obligatory, have been lost, such as various
verbal inflections (e.g. most of the person markings) and nominal inflections (e.g.
case marking). Some features of the English of today were not present at the time of
Beowulf, such as various types of TMA markings (e.g. be going to as a future tense
marker). Yet other features that are not part of Standard English today but that can
be widely found in colloquial Englishes, might enter the linguistic system of Standard
English in the future and even become part of a paradigm of obligatory grammatical
features. For example, the pronunciation of be going to as a future marker may differ
from the pronunciation of be going to as a lexical verb: compare I’m gonna hang the
laundry now (which means I will now hang the laundry and not *I will now go=propel
myself by way of motion to hang the laundry) with I’m going to the park now (which
386	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
means I mean to go=propel myself by way of motion to the park now). While going
to may be used both as a future marker (as in I’m going to hang the laundry now) as
well as a lexical verb of motion, the reduced form gonna cannot be used as a verb of
motion: something like *I’m gonna the park now is not acceptable. In other words, be
going to as an auxiliary has, in colloquial English, acquired a different form (gonna)
distinguishable from be going to as a lexical verb. It may be that this differentiation will
one day become obligatory in Standard English, to the extent that even the written
language may have an obligatory distinction between the two.
The process by which grammatical forms emerge and develop in languages is
called grammaticalization. This is essentially a process by which less grammatical
forms become more grammatical, for instance lexical items become grammatical
items and grammatical items become even more grammatical. At the same time vari-
ous morphosyntactic and phonological processes tend to occur, such as a reduction
in the form of the unit (compare the reduced gonna with the original going to). The
full cycle of grammaticalization has been reached when the form is ultimately lost and
new forms take its place. Very simplified, this could be argued to be a cycle where con-
structions become more synthetic as forms fuse, or more analytic as fused forms are
lost and are replaced by lexical items that have developed into new grammatical items.
This section will first give a very brief overview of the fundamental processes of
grammaticalization, which will serve as a theoretical background for grammaticaliza-
tion paths that will then be exemplified. I can here hardly even begin to scratch the
surface of the topic of grammaticalization, which has received a vast amount of atten-
tion. I stress that the characteristics of grammaticalization outlined here are, by neces-
sity, highly simplified. For very thorough introductions to grammaticalization, see, for
example Hopper & Traugott (2003), Lehmann (2002) and Heine et al. (1991) as well as
the chapters in Narrog & Heine (2011). For a very thorough, but more theoretical dis-
cussion on the factors involved in the development of linguistic complexity, see Dahl
(2004). An article-length introduction to grammaticalization is, for example, Heine
(2003). For a very useful bibliography on grammaticalization made available online by
Christian Lehmann, see http://www.christianlehmann.eu/lehr/grammatikalisierung/
(accessed 19 March 2011). A seminal piece of work on grammaticalization and the ori-
gin of grammar is Heine & Kuteva (2007), which this section draws on considerably.
13.1.1â•‡ The process of grammaticalization
The process of grammaticalization covers various interconnected mechanisms and
stages. A lexical item undergoing grammaticalization goes through a stage of dese-
manticization, in that the sum of the semantic content of the lexical item is succes-
sively bleached to only the grammatical content of the item. For instance, be going to
ceases to signify movement and starts to signify intention. With this loss of semantic
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 387
content the pragmatic use of the item changes in that it becomes appropriate in a
wider set of contexts; it undergoes extension or generalization in contexts of use. For
example, once be going to has started to signify intention and future tense, it may be
used in contexts that do not involve any motion (e.g. I’m going to read out loud to you).
With this, the original morphological and syntactic categorial properties of the item
(for example be going to being a verb meaning that a mobile and volitional subject en-
gages in movement from place A to place B) tend to erode so that the item is no longer
possible to identify as belonging to any major grammatical category (that is, a noun
or a verb): the item gets decategorialized. This tends to lead to increased frequency
in use, which in turn tends to lead to phonological erosion (compare be going to with
gonna), which may carry with it certain other morphosyntactic effects, such as loss
of status as an independent word (i.e. the item may become a clitic or an affix).203 The
process may thus be said to work along a pathway, or cline, of stages, where the item
to the left is less grammatical than its neighbour to the right:
content item > grammatical (functional) item > clitic > inflectional affix204
Figure 13.1â•‡ The“cline of grammaticality”(Hopper &Traugott 2003:â•›7 with minimal changes).
It is very important here to keep in mind that these processes and stages are not meant
as abrupt and definite. The mechanisms involved are all interrelated, so that it is not
possible to draw absolute boundaries between them. A linguistic form changes gradu-
ally (even if the speed may vary); it is more like a fluid process with the stages form-
ing landmarks around which features tend to cluster. It is also important to keep in
mind that the original source use of the item does not necessarily disappear. It would
be quite inaccurate to think of the grammaticalization process as if a linguistic item
203.â•‡ There is no real way of establishing what comes first, semantic “bleaching” then frequency
leading to erosion, or frequency in use leading to “bleaching” and erosion. For instance, the string
of words forming the polite inquiry ‘How are you?’ became a general greeting to the effect that it was
no longer a question that needed a meaningful answer, a process sometimes also called emancipa-
tion. The whole greeting got reduced to ‘Hi’, which is not answered with ‘Fine’ anymore in Standard
English, although there are varieties where such an answer is appropriate (cf. Bybee 2003b:â•›155). The
question here is which came first: the frequency in use which led to an erosion of meaning and form,
or a “bleaching” in meaning which led to a high frequency in use which in turn led to erosion in
form. For more on the role of frequency in grammaticalization, see Bybee (2003a). For a collection
of articles discussing the interplay of frequency and grammaticalization, see Bybee (2007).
204.â•‡ It could also be argued that this cline illustrates the path from a more analytic form to a more
synthetic form, the further right on the cline the item is.
388	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
hops like a frog from one stepping stone to the other. I stress again that this is a fluid
process, more a champagne glass tower where the liquid flows in one direction and
pools in the glasses along the way. For instance, even though be going to has acquired
a phonologically reduced form that exclusively functions as a future marker (gonna),
the source verb is still in use. Due to this linear but overlapping nature of grammati-
calization the stages have variously been described as stages along a pathway, a cline,
or a chain (where each link of the chain interlaces in the other), among other terms.
13.1.1.1â•‡ Desemanticization
The term desemanticization or “bleaching” (sometimes also called semantic reduc-
tion) tries to capture the fact that when a linguistic construction gets used in new con-
texts, it has, by then, lost some of its original semantic content. Consider, for example,
the construction be going to in (358) below:
	 (358)	 a.	 We	 are going to London.
				 [movement]
			 S = [+volitional; +mobile]
		 b.	 We	 are going to have a party.
				 [intention]
			 S = [+volitional]
		 c.	 The trees	 are going to crack in this storm.
				 [future]
			 S = [−volitional; −mobile]
In (358a) we have a verb that signifies motion from one place in space to another.
It also implies that the subject of the verb would typically be mobile and that the
movement would be volitional, something along the line of “We are now choosing
to move ourselves in the direction of London”. In other words, the construction in
(358a) implies an active, agentive verb with an animate subject. In (358b) the inher-
ent semantic feature [+movement] of the verb has been lost (there is no movement
in space implied), as has the implication that the subject of the verb must be mobile;
the construction has been semantically “bleached”. In (358c) the construction neither
implies movement in space nor intention, and the subject can neither be considered
as mobile nor as acting out of volition; the construction may now be used with any
type of verb and any type of subject – the construction has been further “bleached”.
However, as Hopper & Traugott (2003:â•›94f) point out, what the construction goes
through might be better viewed as a shift or redistribution in meaning, rather than
loss. We could also analyse it as follows:
	 (359)	 a.	 We	 are going to London.
				 [movement [intention [future]]]
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 389
			 S = [+volitional; +mobile]
		 b.	 We	 are going to have a party.
				 [intention [future]]
			 S = [+volitional]
		 c.	 The trees	 are going to crack in the storm.
					 [future]
			 S = [−volitional; −mobile]
If we think of the construction be going to in (359a) as carrying the semantic content
of [+movement] which in itself carries a notion of [+intention] (the intention of
getting to the place the movement will take us to), which in turn has a slight implica-
tion of [+futurity] (we haven’t yet arrived at the place our movement will take us
to), then the “bleaching” process acquires more of a sense of redistribution. In (359a)
the most salient semantic feature is [+movement]. In (359b) the semantic saliency
has shifted to [+intention] while in (359c) it has shifted further, to [+future]. We
may think of is as a shift of perspective where “one meaning is demoted, another pro-
moted” (Hopper & Traugott 2003:â•›94). Due to this shift in semantic content, the con-
struction can be used in other domains than it could before. Thus it can now be used
in contexts that do not involve motion and with subjects that are neither mobile nor
carry the semantic feature of [+volition]. This, in a sense, is then a type of pragmatic
enrichment, in that the construction gains range of use.
This kind of semantic shift is made possible through something called pragmatic
inference (Hopper & Traugott 2003), whereby the speaker and hearer communication
presupposes inherent inferring. We must always remember that language is used for
communication, and that it is shaped according to the needs of that communication.
In the case of be going to, for example, we might picture that a hearer infers that the
external act of movement has an internal motivation of intention and further that the
internal motivation of intention implies temporal sequence.
Desemanticization or “bleaching” is not limited to lexical items loosing se-
mantic content, but can also be found in grammatical items losing part (or all) of
their grammatical functions. An oft-cited example is that of the nominal endings
in Swedish: in Old Swedish the endings were cumulative (portmanteau), expressing
case (nominative/accusative/dative/genitive), gender (masculine/feminine/neuter),
and number (singular/plural). In Modern Swedish the gender (common/neutral)
and number (singular/plural) distinctions are retained, but case has been lost. No-
tice also that the gender distinctions have shifted from three to two. This is what
Norde (2001:â•›243) terms functional reduction. Essentially we are dealing with a
type of “bleaching” or shift, similar to the process of semantic reduction described
for be going to above.
390	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
13.1.1.2â•‡ Extension
Hand in hand with “bleaching” or semantic shift we have extension, whereby the
“bleached” item gets used in new contexts, the pragmatic enrichment mentioned
above. In essence the “bleaching” allows for a context generalization, in that the item
can now be used in a more general range of environments. For example, once be going
to has lost its semantic content of spatial movement, it can be used in a wider set of
contexts, such as in (359b) and eventually also (359c). This also has the sociolinguistic
implication that an innovation is adopted and spreads (diffuses or is propagated)
through the speaking community (Croft 2000). The two parameters of innovation
and propagation are equally necessary: an innovation that does not get propagated
(or does not diffuse) will not end up entering the linguistic system, but if there are no
innovations there is also nothing to propagate.
With the increase of contexts there also tends to be an increase of frequency in
use. This in turn may cause further bleaching, which gives rise to even further exten-
sion:
Repetition itself diminishes the force of a word, phrase or construction. Examples are
legion. (…) You guys generalizes to include females and the word guy now can be used
in colloquial speech even for inanimate objects. In grammaticalization, the generaliza-
tion or bleaching of the meaning of a construction is caused by frequency, but it also
contributes to additional frequency, as a generalized construction can be used in more
contexts, leading to an almost inexorable movement along a grammaticalization path.
 (Bybee 2003b:â•›157)
For instance the dual effect of “bleaching” and expansion can be seen in the French
negative. Originally ne … pas could only be used with motion verbs, as in ne [aller]
pas ‘not [go] a step’ but with “bleaching” the construction was extended to usage with
any kind of verb as in ne [verb] pas ‘not verb’. Further extension and especially an
even higher rate of frequency in use has led to the common construction Ø [verb] pas
‘not verb’, where the original negator has been lost completely and the original noun
pas ‘step’ has acquired the meaning of negation. In other words, through the process
of “bleaching” and extension, the noun pas ‘step’ has in this context lost the morpho-
syntactic properties that would categorize it as a noun and has become a functional
item (negator) only.
13.1.1.3â•‡ Decategorialization
Decategorialization is, as mentioned, a consequence of “bleaching” and extension.
With the increased frequency in use and the generalization of appropriate contexts,
the construction tends to lose the morphosyntactic properties that identify them
with a specific category. For example, the noun in the French negative construction
ne … pas has lost its properties as a noun (something like *ne parler un pas, with
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 391
an article before pas, to express ‘don’t talk’ would not be possible). Another typical
example of a noun that has decategorialized is the conjunction while, which derives
from the Old English noun hwīl ‘length of time’. The word can still be used as a
noun, as in I stayed at home for a while, but even so some of the typical properties of
nouns have been lost. For instance, while cannot be inflected for plural, something
like *I stayed there several whiles is not generally acceptable. As a conjunction while
(as in while we were eating) has lost all properties of a noun, as shown by Hopper
& Traugott (2003:â•›107): (i) it cannot take articles or quantifiers (*the while we were
eating/*some whiles we were eating); (ii) it cannot be modified by adjectives or de-
monstratives (*the short while we were eating/*that while we were eating); (iii) it
cannot serve as any other argument of a verb than an object (*while took long); (iv)
it can only appear clause initially (compare The phone rang while we were eating but
not *The phone rang we were eating while); and (v) it cannot be referred to by an
anaphoric pronoun. Decategorialization might have a negative ring of loss to it, but
in fact the shift also entails gains, in that the item gains the properties of the new
category. The functional shift has here led to while as a conjunction being used in a
way that a noun cannot be used. Consequently, there has been decategorialization
leading while away from the category Noun, but there has also been a functional
gain leading it towards the category Conjunction.
An example of a decategorialized verb is the English modal auxiliary can, which
derives from the Old English cunnan ‘to know’ and has lost its properties as a lexi-
cal verb. For instance, it is no longer possible to use it as a clausal predicate, as in *I
can the place (but cf. the acceptable I know the place), or to place it in an infinitival
construction *to can (but cf. to know) or in the progressive *canning (but cf. knowing).
Functional, or closed class, items may also undergo decategorialization. For ex-
ample, demonstrative pronouns form a common source (or origin) for relative clause
markers. This is also the case in English, where that derives from the demonstra-
tive that. As a demonstrative it may inflect for plural (that book/those books) but as
a relative clause marker it has decategorialized – it no longer belongs to the category
‘demonstrative pronoun’ – and has thus lost some of the properties of that category.
It can, for example, not be inflected for plural (cf. The book that I read but *The books
those I read).
13.1.1.4â•‡ Erosion
A linguistic construction that is used very frequently tends to lose phonetic substance,
and grammaticalization processes often involve phonetic erosion or reduction. We
have already seen that the construction going to has, as a future marker, eroded to
gonna. It might in the future further erode to, for example, gon. Phonetic erosion can
be of various types. Phonetic segments may be lost, even entire syllables. This is what
392	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
happened with going to > gonna (one syllable was lost) and the Old English construc-
tion þā hwīle þe ‘during the time that’ which led to the Modern English conjunction
while (two free words of one syllable each have been lost). Suprasegmental properties
may be lost (e.g. stress or tone). This is what happened to the adjective full when it
grammaticalized to the derivational suffix â•‚ful and in the process lost its ability to be
stressed (here an analytic construction has become synthetic through grammatical-
ization). Phonetic autonomy can be lost altogether, whereby the item becomes a clitic
or an affix, and may even entail assimilation to the new host. An example of a noun
that grammaticalized into an affix is the Proto-Germanic (Indo-European (German-
ic)) noun*līkaâ•‚ ‘body, appearance’ which came to be used in compound construc-
tions of the type “having the appearance of” (e.g. Germanic *frijōndlika ‘having the
appearance of a friend’). The noun eventually “bleached” and extended to become an
adjective derivational suffix. In the process it lost in phonological substance, going
from Germanic *līka to Old English â•‚lic and, via Middle English â•‚lich(e)/â•‚lik(e)/â•‚li(e)
“bleached” and extended further into the Modern English adjective and adverb deri-
vational suffix â•‚ly. The adverb suffix might now be eroding even further into complete
loss, with colloquial varieties allowing such constructions as Sit down quietâ•‚Ø or It
came directâ•‚Ø from him to me (for Sit down quietâ•‚ly and It came directâ•‚ly from him to
me respectively). Phonetic erosion may also involve phonetic simplification, as exem-
plified in going to > gonna, where the cluster /ŋt/ in /gɔɪŋtu/ has been simplified to /n/
in /gɔnə/.
13.1.2		 Paths of grammaticalization
The evolution of grammatical categories shows a great deal of cross-linguistic unifor-
mity. That is, the routes by which various grammatical categories enter the linguistic
system of a language tend to follow similar patterns among the languages of the world.
The following will show some examples of typical grammaticalization paths. For an
impressive inventory of grammaticalization paths, based on data from over 500 lan-
guages, see Heine & Kuteva (2002), which I base many of the examples in this section
on. For the sake of iconicity, I will, essentially, follow the grammaticalization cline
in that I will start with the least grammatical linguistic items and end with the most
grammatical linguistic items (cf. Figure 13.1 above) that tend to be found cross-lin-
guistically. The examples given in this section are by necessity sketchy and the reader
is encouraged to refer to the sources given for further details. A notational remark: ‘<’
means ‘derives from’ and ‘>’ means ‘becomes’.
13.1.2.1â•‡ Content words
Content items constitute the least grammatical items on the cline. We have seen that
nouns and verbs are two near-universal categories (cf. 6.2). Much of the grammatical
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 393
material in a language can be hypothesized to ultimately have belonged to one of these
two categories. In those languages where adjectives and adverbs constitute their own
classes, they are typically ultimately derived from either nouns or verbs.
i.	 Adjectives
Noun > Adjective. Nouns that serve as sources for adjectives tend to be, for example,
plants, animals and metals. The English adjective orange is an example of this. Nouns
denoting gender-specific humans, such as ‘woman’ and ‘man’ or ‘mother’ and ‘father’,
also typically serve as sources for adjectives, most commonly to derive adjectives
meaning ‘female’ and ‘male’ (compare the English derivation girly < girlNâ•‚ly). In !Xóõ,
for example, à̰a ‘father’ has grammaticalized to mean ‘male’:
		 !Xóõ (Khoisan (Southern Khoisan): Botswana)
	 (360)	 gùmi	 à̰a
		 cattle	 father
		 ‘ox’  (Traill 1994:â•›154)
Verb > Adjective. Impressionistically, adjectives seem even more often to derive from
verbs. If this is so, one possible explanation might be the fact that cross-linguistically
adjectives often follow the be-X construction. An example of a very basic descriptive
word of size is Swedish stor ‘big’ which ultimately derives from Proto-Indo-European
*st(h)ā ‘stand’ (Hellquist 1980:â•›1083). The basic descriptive word of colour, white, ul-
timately derives from the Proto-Indo-European nominal/verbal root *k̂ueiâ•‚ ‘shine;
light’ (Nielsen 1989:â•›193).
wind and sun compass
Very common sources for cardinal directions
are atmospheric phenomena, especially wind,
for ‘north’ and ‘south’, and celestial bodies and
events, especially the movement of the sun,
for ‘east’ and ‘west’. For a very detailed study
on the origin of cardinal direction terms, see
Brown (1983).
ii.	 Adverbs
Noun > Adverb. Sources for adverbs are often nouns relating to spatial concepts or
body parts. For example, the adverb up often derives from nouns meaning ‘sky’ or up-
per body parts, such as the Teso (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Uganda) a-kuju ‘feminine-
sky’ > kuju ‘above, up’ (Kitching 1915:â•›74) and the Kupto (Afro-Asiatic (West Chadic):
Nigeria) kúu ‘head’ > ‘above, up’ (Heine & Kuteva 2002:â•›170 citing Leger 1991:â•›20).
394	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
Notice that the Teso gender marker aâ•‚ ‘feminine’ disappears when the noun has de-
categorialized to an adverb.
Verb > Adverb. Impressionistically, adverbs more often derive from nouns. How-
ever, there are a number of instances where verbs serve as the source of adverbs. It is
common that serial verb constructions serve as the source for adverbs, whereby one
of the serialized verbs grammaticalizes into a modifier and loses its characteristics as
a verb. In Ewe (Niger-Congo (Kwa): Ghana), for example, the verb ɗi ‘descend’ > the
adverb ‘down; beforehand’ (Lord 1993:â•›228), probably via the serial da ɗi ‘put descend’
(cf. Heine & Kuteva 2002:â•›117).
13.1.2.2â•‡ Function words
Function items constitute the second level or stage on the grammaticalization cline
(content item > function item). They are most typically derived from content items.
i.	 Pronouns
Noun > Pronoun. A very common path of grammaticalization is for the noun ‘per-
son’ or ‘man’ to grammaticalize to the impersonal pronoun, for example Latin homo
‘person, man’ > French on ‘one’ (as in ‘one should rest after eating’). The noun ‘per-
son’ often also grammaticalizes into the first person plural pronoun ‘we’, as in Kono
(Niger-Congo (Western Mande): Sierra Leone) where mɔ̀ɔ̀ ‘man, person’ > mɔ̂ ‘we.
inclusiveÂ�
’ (notice the phonological erosion from long to short vowel and the alterna-
tion in tone pattern) (Heine & Kuteva 2002:â•›233 citing Donald A. Lessau, p.c.). A simi-
lar path of grammaticalization is currently taking place in Brazilian Portuguese where
the NP a gente ‘the people’ > a ’ente ‘we’ (again, notice the phonological erosion where
the initial gâ•‚ is lost; Zilles 2005).
The nouns ‘body’ and ‘head’ are common sources for reflexive pronouns (see
Schladt 2000 for a survey of sources for reflexives). In Ùsàk Èdèt (Niger-Congo (Cross
River): Nigeria) únem ‘body’ > reflexive marker ‘self’ (Essien 1982:â•›98).
Verb > Pronoun. This concerns mainly demonstratives, which often derive from
general verbs of motion meaning ‘come’ or ‘go’, as in Mopun (Afro-Asiatic (West
Chadic): Nigeria), where sò ‘this’ < Proto-Chadic (Afro-Asiatic (Chadic)) *(â•‚)sò ‘to
come’ and ɗì ‘there’ < Proto-Chadic *ɗò ‘to go’ (Frajzyngier 1987). However, Diessel
(1999a) argues that demonstratives actually represent a category of function words
that has not grammaticalized from any lexical source but that they in fact belong to
very basic original language. He points out the lack of consistent evidence for lexical
sources for demonstratives, as well as the rather systematic sound symbolism that
demonstratives display (especially with regard to vowel quality: proximate demon-
stratives tend to have a higher pitch than distal demonstratives, as in this (proximate),
which has a high vowel, versus that (distal), which has a low vowel), and given that
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 395
“sound symbolism is usually associated with newly created words” (Diessel 1999a:
151f) this might serve as an indication that these are, in fact, typically original, non-
grammaticalized words.
ii.	 Adpositions
Noun (spatial) > Adposition. Spatial nouns are very common sources for adposi-
tions. The Lezgian noun pad ‘side’ > the postposition patal ‘for’ (Haspelmath 1993:
222). The Swahili noun m-paka ‘class.3-border’ > the preposition mpaka ‘until’
(HeineÂ�& Kuteva 2002:â•›61). Body parts also often serve as sources for locational adpo-
sitions. In Wan (Niger-Congo (Eastern Mande): Ivory Coast), for example, the noun
káò ‘belly’ > the postposition ‘inside’ and the noun dìŋ ‘hip, side’ > ‘near, close.to, next.
to’ (Nikitina 2008:â•›35).
Verb (motion) > Adposition. This seems slightly less common than adpositions
deriving from nouns. Typically, general movement verbs may grammaticalize into
adpositions, often via verb serialization. Examples are the Ewe verb ná ‘give’ > ‘for’
(Heine & Reh 1984:â•›37). The North-Central Malaitan *fa’asi ‘leave, forsake’ > Toqa-
baqita fa’asi ‘from’ (Lichtenberk 1991), or the French arriver ‘arrive’ > Haitian Creole
rivé ‘to’ (Heine & Kuteva 2007:â•›73).
iii.	 Articles
Demonstrative > Definite article. Definite articles “are almost invariably derived
from demonstratives” (Heine 2003:â•›594), as is the case in English with English the <
that. In Basque the oblique stem harâ•‚ of the distal demonstrative (h)ura ‘that’ > â•‚a/â•‚ak
‘the’ (singular/plural; Hualde & Ortiz de Urbina 2003:â•›119,â•›123); again, notice the pho-
nological erosion of harâ•‚ to â•‚a (â•‚k is a plural suffix) and that we have an instance of
an analytic construction (the free word demonstrative (h)ura) developing into a syn-
thetic one (the definite suffix). For a lengthy discussion on demonstratives and how
they tend to be grammaticalized, see Diessel (1999b).
Numeral ‘one’ > Indefinite article. Indefinite pronouns almost invariably derive
from the numeral ‘one’, as is the case in English: a(n) < Old English ān ‘one’. In Turkish
bir ‘one’ is used both as a numeral and as an indefinite article: bir elma ‘one/an apple’
(Kornfilt 2003:â•›106).
the future sun
In Mandinka (Niger-Congo (Western Mande):
Senegal) sina means both ‘sun’ and ‘future
tense’ via a grammaticalization path of si-na
‘sun-come’>‘tomorrow.’ (Claudi 1994)
396	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
iv.	 Auxiliaries
Verb > Auxiliary. This is an almost universal path of grammaticalization. TMA aux-
iliaries almost invariably derive from verbs. For instance, future tense auxiliaries
very often come from verbs meaning ‘want’ or general motion verbs such as ‘go’. For
example, the English will ‘future’ < Old English willan ‘to want’ and the Klao mu
‘future’ < ‘go’:
		 Klao (Niger-Congo (Kru): Liberia)
	 (361)	 a.	 ɔ̄ɔ̄	 mū	 nī	 tó
			 he.ipfv	 go	 loc	 store
			 ‘He is going to the store.’
		 b.	 ɔ̄ɔ̄	 mū	 nī	 kpa
			 he.imp	 fut	 water	 hit
			 ‘He will swim.’  (Marchese 1986:â•›74)
In (361a) the verb mū ‘go’ functions as a lexical verb, while in (361b) it has been decat-
egorialized to a future marking auxiliary. Progressive and imperfective aspects very
often derive from stative or copular location expressions (X stands at Y or X is at Y).
Progressives are then in turn very often the source for imperfective aspect and pres-
ent tense markers. In Maninka, for example, we find the following grammaticalization
path: yé ‘to see’ > copula > imperfective via a kind of exclamatory construction of the
type “See X in the bush!” (Kastenholz 2003:â•›39):
		 Maninka (Niger-Congo (Western Mande): Guinea)
	 (362)	 a.	 kamori	 yé	 wàá	 dɔ́
			 PN	 cop (< ‘see’)	 bush	 in
			 ‘See Kamori in the bush!’ > ‘Kamori is in the bush.’
		 b.	 ń	 yé	 màló	 dɔ́mun-na
			 1sg	 ipfv	 rice	 eat-ipfv
			 ‘I am eating rice.’ / ‘I (usually) eat rice.’  (Kastenholz 2003:â•›40)
In (362a) the verb yé ‘see’ already serves as a copula, while in (362b) it has become an
imperfective marker.
Verbs meaning ‘finish’ are very often the source for completive, perfective or per-
fect markers Bybee et al. (1994). Modality markers often derive from verbs meaning
‘to be able to’ or ‘to know’ to form dynamic event modalities (such as the English can <
Old English cunnan ‘to know’). For a classic piece of work on the grammaticalization
paths of TMA categories, see Bybee et al. (1994).
Negative auxiliaries often derive from verbs meaning ‘leave’ or ‘lack’, such as the
Klao sē ‘negator’ < sɨ ‘let go, leave’ (Marchese 1986:â•›173,â•›182). Negative existential
verbs (‘to not.exist’) form another very common source for negators (cf. Croft 1991);
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 397
these may in turn actually derive from a negator plus an existential or locative, which
in turn may have derived from verbs for ‘live’, ‘sit’, ‘stand’, and the like. One may hy-
pothesize a path of the following kind: verb (‘live’/‘sit’/etc.) > existential/locative >
negator+existential/locative > negative existential verb > negative auxiliary.
v.	 Conjunctions
Noun > Complementizer. It is very common for general nouns such as ‘thing’, ‘mat-
ter’, ‘place’ and so on to serve as sources for complementizers. For example, the
Japanese koto ‘nominalizer’ < ‘thing’ (Lehmann 2002:â•›56).
Verb > Complementizer. Verbs for ‘say’ or ‘be like’/‘resemble’ form another very
common source for complementizers, such as the Taiwanese (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese):
Taiwan) verb kóng ‘say’ > complementizer ((363) below) and the Twi (Niger-Congo
(Kwa): Ghana) verb sɛ ‘resemble, be.like, etc.’ > complementizer ((364) below):
		 Taiwanese (Sino-Tibetan (Chinese): Taiwan)
	 (363)	 a.	 a	 i	 kóng	 lì	 àn-noân?
			 prt	 3sg	 say	 2sg	 how
			 ‘So what did he say about you?’
		 b.	 i	 kanna	 liām	 kóng	 á-hô	 thàn	 chiok-chē	 chîn
			 3sg	 just	 nag	 that	 PN	 earn	 much	 money
			 ‘He kept insisting that A-Ho earns a lot of money.’  (Chappell 2008:â•›66,â•›71)
		 Twi (Niger-Congo (Kwa): Ghana)
	 (364)	 a.	 kofi	 sɛ	 amma
			 PN	 be.like	 PN
			 ‘Kofi resembles Amma.’
		 b.	 na	 ama	 nim	 sɛ	 kofi	 bɛyɛ	 adwuma	 no
			 past	 PN	 know	 that	 PN	 did	 work	 art
			 ‘Ama knew that Kofi had done the work.’  (Lord 1993:â•›152,â•›159)
It seems near at hand to hypothesize that the grammaticalization path went along
the lines of verb (‘say’/‘resemble’) > quotative > complementizer. In fact the English
like seems to be grammaticalizing into a quotative marker, especially in American
English, as in He said, ‘What’s the matter with you?’ And I’m like, ‘None of your busi-
ness’ (cf. RomaineÂ�& Lange 1991). One day it might end up grammaticalizing into a
complementizer.
Demonstrative > Complementizer. This is also very common and is what hap-
pened in English with the complementizer that < the Old English demonstrative þæt.
Complementizers often go on to grammaticalize into relative clause markers.
398	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
vi.	 Classifiers
Noun > Classifier. Classifiers frequently have their origin in nouns, typically generic
nouns (such as ‘human’, ‘tree’, ‘animal’, ‘seed’ and so on), which commonly serve as
sources for sortal classifiers. In Mandarin, for example, the noun tóu ‘head’ > classifier
for big animals such as oxen, pigs, elephants (but also, interestingly, garlic) and zhī2
‘twig’ > classifier for long and slim (essentially one-dimensional) tools, such as arrows,
chopsticks, flutes, rifles and so on (Bisang 1999:â•›133). Body parts may serve as sources
for mensural classifiers.
13.1.2.3â•‡ Clitics
Clitics constitute the third level or stage on the grammaticalization cline (content item
> function item > clitic). From this stage onwards the concern is mostly about how the
grammaticalization affects the morphosyntactic and phonological form of the item.
Particles, adpositions, pronouns, articles and auxiliaries are examples of items that
may get reduced in form to the extent that they need a host to cliticize to. Recall that
clitics are syntactically independent, even though they are phonologically dependent
items. The erosion has thus not affected the syntactic dependency, only the phono-
logical one.
For example, the late Imperial Latin construction involving the inflected auxiliary
‘have’ developed into the Old Spanish future marker clitic:
		 Latin (Indo-European (Italic): present-day Italy)
	 (365)	 vidēre	 habēo
		 see.inf	 have.1sg
		 ‘I have to see.’  (Hock 2003:â•›450)
		 Old Spanish (Indo-European (Romance): present-day Spain)
	 (366)	 a.	 veer=he
			 see=fut.1sg
			 ‘I will see.’
		 b.	 veer=lo=he
			 see=it=fut.1sg
			 ‘I will see it.’  (Hock 2003:â•›450)
In (365) we have the Latin construction with an inflected auxiliary following a lexical
verb. In (366) the auxiliary has eroded to a clitic; it needs a host to attach to. Notice
that it is still syntactically independent from the host and may attach to any element,
as shown in (366b) (in this case another clitic). The clitic further developed into an
inflectional affix, see below.
Another oft-cited example of cliticization is the Proto-Norse (Indo-European
(Germanic)) reflexive pronoun *sik ‘self’ that eroded to a clitic â•‚sk, which is still
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 399
Â�
traceable in, for instance, the English verb bask < Old Norse baða-sk < Proto-Norse
*baða sik ‘bathe (one)self’. This clitic also further developed into an affix, see below.
13.1.2.4â•‡ Inflectional affixes
Affixes constitute the fourth level or stage on the grammaticalization cline (content
item > function item > clitic > affix). At this stage the item has become both phonologi-
cally and syntactically dependent on its host. For example, the Old Spanish clitic men-
tioned in (366) above developed into an inflectional future affix in Modern Spanish:
		 Modern Spanish (Indo-European (Romance): Spain)
	 (367)	 a.	 ver-é
			 see-fut.1sg
			 ‘I will see.’
		 b.	 lo	 ver-é
			 it	 see-fut.1sg
			 ‘I see it.’  (Hock 2003:â•›450 with minimal changes)
Notice that the affix is now syntactically dependent on its host. It could not, for exam-
ple, attach to the object of the clause; something like *verâ•‚loâ•‚é or *loâ•‚é ver would not
be possible for ‘I see it’. The Proto-Norse *â•‚sik > â•‚sk ‘self’ grammaticalized further to a
derivational affix â•‚st205 which in turn grammaticalized to the passive affix â•‚s (cf. Enger
2002), as in Swedish tala ‘speak’ (active) versus talaâ•‚s ‘be spoken’ (passive). These are
again examples of analytic constructions becoming synthetic (cf. the analytic vidēre
habēo > the synthetic ver-é).
Case markers often ultimately derive from nouns or verbs. General motion verbs
may develop into, for example, ablative, allative and benefactive cases, while general
verbs for ‘give’ often develop into benefactive and ultimately dative cases. For exam-
ple, the Sa’a (Austronesian (Oceanic): Solomon Islands) dative case marker huniâ•‚ <
Proto-Oceanic (Austronesian (Oceanic)) *pa(nñ)i ‘give’ (Lichtenberk 1985:â•›25). Gen-
eral locational or spatial nouns such as ‘back’, ‘front’, ‘side’, etc., may develop into
locational case markers, often via an adpositional stage.
13.1.3		 A very short note on unidirectionality and degrammaticalization
Grammaticalization is overwhelmingly unidirectional in that we have many known
cases of items travelling from the left to the right on the grammaticalization cline,
i.e. going from less grammatical to more grammatical, but only very few examples
205.â•‡ Thus stative verbs could be derived with â•‚st from nouns and adjectives, such as flokkr ‘crowd’
(noun) > flykkjast ‘flock (together)’ (verb) and grænn ‘green’ (adjective) > grænast ‘become green’
(Enger 2002:â•›84).
400	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
of the reverse, i.e. items going from more grammatical to less grammatical. The term
degrammaticalization was coined by Christian Lehmann (1982) to capture what he
postulated as the impossible concept of reversed grammaticalization. For instance,
while we rather often see that a lexical item such as the Proto-Germanic noun*līkaâ•‚
‘body, appearance’ grammaticalizes into a derivational suffix such as the English â•‚ly,
we rarely see instances of where the reverse happens. In other words, it is not generally
expected that, for example, the English derivational suffix â•‚ly will degrammaticalize
and become a content word. Since Lehmann’s coinage there has been a lively discus-
sion whether or not the assumption of unidirectionality in grammaticalization holds.
It is beyond the scope of this chapter to give a thorough discussion of the validity
or invalidity of unidirectionality and the putative counterexamples to it. For acces-
sible overviews of the arguments against unidirectionality, see Haspelmath (2004)
and Janda (2001) with references.
Some commonly cited examples of degrammaticalization (or ‘antigrammatical-
ization’) are the following (for more examples of attested and valid cases of degram-
maticalization, see Haspelmath 2004 and Traugott 2001):
i.	 The genitive suffix â•‚s in English and Scandinavian languages degrammaticalizing
to a clitic =s (but see Traugott 2001 for an argument against this being a legitimate
example of degrammaticalization).  (Norde 2001)
ii.	 The Pennsylvania German (Indo-European (Germanic): USA) auxiliary in the
preterit subjunctive form welle ‘would’ developed into a lexical verb wotte ‘wish,
desire’.  (Burridge 1998)
iii.	 The Irish first person plural subject suffix â•‚mid/â•‚muid developed into an indepen-
dent first person plural pronoun muid(e).  (Bybee et al. 1994)
13.2	 Contact-induced change and linguistic areas
Languages may also change due to contact with other languages. Language contact
in essence means that a number of speakers of one language have a certain degree
of competence in another language (or several other languages). I stress once again
that when we deal with languages we must always remember that they are dynamic
systems used by speakers as a tool for interaction. It would be a very rare community
indeed that was self-sufficient to the extent that it never had contact with any other
community at all. We may therefore assume that most, if not all, communities (and
hence the languages of these communities) have been in contact with other com-
munities (and their languages). It is, in fact, rather more common in the world that
speakers live in multilingual settings, where they use different languages for different
purposes or in different situations, than that they live in monolingual settings where
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 401
one and the same language is used for all purposes and in all situations. However, the
extent to which this contact will influence any or all of the languages in question may
differ considerably.
This section will briefly outline some of the sociolinguistic factors and mecha-
nisms involved in contact-induced change. It will also mention what kinds of lin-
guistic features languages may adopt from other languages as well as introduce and
briefly discuss the concept of linguistic areas. As indicated by the recurrent word
‘briefly’, this section can by no means cover all the various issues related to language
contact, linguistic areas, and contact languages. Each of these is a vast subject which
can only be very shortly summarized here. A very accessible introduction to con-
tact linguistics is Thomason (2001). For article-length overviews of contact-induced
change, see Koptjevskaja-Tamm (2010) and Aikhenvald (2006a). The latter is a com-
prehensive introduction to Aikhenvald & Dixon (2006a), which contains a number
of chapters discussing various contact phenomena in different languages and areas.
A very detailed overview of grammatical borrowings can be found in Matras &
Sakel (2007), which functions as a survey of contact-induced change in different
languages and is based on Jeanette Sakel and Yaron Matras’ Language Convergence
and Grammatical Borrowing Database (henceforth LCGB). A detailed survey of the
typology of loanwords can be found in Haspelmath & Tadmor (2009), which is
based on the World Loanword Database. A classic in contact linguistics is Thomason
& Kaufman (1988).
A terminological note: the language from which a linguistic feature originates is
here called the source language, while the language which adopts a linguistic feature
from another language is here called the recipient language.
13.2.1â•‡ Sociolinguistic factors and mechanisms of contact-induced change
The type of contact situation, as well as such things as the size and language attitudes
of the communities in question, all combine to lead to different kinds of borrowing,
or diffusion. Linguistic features can be taken over wholesale, where both the form and
the function are borrowed, or the principles can be taken over, where the function,
but not the form is borrowed. Or anything in between.
13.2.1.1â•‡ Types of contact situation
Very simplified, the sociolinguistic factors involved in contact-induced change boil
down to the basic parameter of dominance. Essentially, there are two types of contact
situations with respect to dominance: (i) the language(s) in contact are on a more or
less equal footing, and (ii) the language(s) in contact are not on an equal footing, i.e.
the contact situation involves one (or occasionally several) language(s) that domi-
nate over other languages. Dominance can be due to factors such as social prestige
402	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
or Â�
political power. The two basic situations are sometimes termed balanced versus
displacive language contact (cf. Aikhenvald 2006a). In both cases we tend to get bi-
or multilingualism. However, in a balanced language contact situation the multilin-
gualism tends to be mutual in the sense that speakers and languages influence each
other and speakers of both or all the languages in contact may be bi- or multilingual.
In other words, balanced contact situations tend to lead to a two- (or several-) way
influence. In the Vaupés river basin area of Amazonia at the Colombian/Brazilian
border, for example, speakers of the same language are considered blood relatives.
Hence spouses are sought from other language groups. This linguistic exogamy has
given rise to a situation of stable multilingualism, where borrowing is more or less
multidirectional (Aikhenvald 2006b).
In a displacive language contact situation the influence tends to be one-way:
the multilingualism is typically found only among the speakers of the dominated
language(s) and not among the speakers of the dominating language. There are, for
example, no monolingual Welsh speakers in Wales; any Welsh speaker will be at least
bilingual in English (although in some rural areas some older speakers may be more
fluent in Welsh than in English). There are, however, a vast number of monolingual
English speakers that do not need to have any knowledge of Welsh to get by. Thus
the two types of situation may lead to radically different results: while in balanced
language contact situations the linguistic systems tend to enrich each other – forms
from the various languages are incorporated into the other languages, ultimately
leading to a more complex system – displacive language contact systems rather lead
to the opposite, in that the dominated language(s) may adopt linguistic structures
of the dominating language. Instances of extreme dominance may ultimately lead
to language loss if speakers end up shifting to the dominating language (language
shift). This may come about due to enforcement, such as laws against using minority
languages, or due to lack of socioeconomic opportunities in the minority language,
leading the speakers of the minority language community to opt for the dominating
language (cf. 3.1.1).
Note that a language can be both dominating and dominated at the same time:
Katanga Swahili (Niger-Congo (Bantoid)), for example, is the lingua franca of the
North-Eastern region of The Democratic Republic of Congo. It is taught in primary
schools and is recognized as a national language. As such it is a language dominat-
ing over the regional languages in the area. However, Katanga Swahili is in turn
dominated by French, the administrative language of the country (see further de
Rooij 2007).
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 403
13.2.1.2â•‡ Types of borrowing
Linguistic features may transfer between languages in various ways. Strictly speaking
diffusion of linguistic features is not a matter of borrowing, but rather one of copying,
as Lars Johanson rightly points out (see e.g. 2008): speakers do not “borrow” features
which they use for a while and then return to the “owner” or the source language, but
copy features from one language (or variety) into another. As the term ‘borrowing’ is
so widely used, I will conform to that convention here. However, the reader should at
all times keep in mind that linguistic ‘borrowing’ is a matter of code copying rather
than anything else.
Following Matras & Sakel (2007) I distinguish between matter borrowing (or
MAT), where the phonological shape and the morphological form is taken over from
one language to another, and pattern replication (or PAT), also called calques, where
effectively the function of the linguistic feature is taken over but not the form. This
essentially mirrors the distinction between ‘fabric’ and ‘pattern’ borrowing as previ-
ously outlined in Grant (1999 and 2002). An example of a matter borrowing is the
Spanish (source) word entre ‘between’ in Guaraní (Tupian (Tupi-Guaraní): Paraguay)
(recipient), where both meaning and form have been taken over in the recipient lan-
guage (Matras 2007:â•›42). An example of a pattern replication can be found in the
Estonian (Uralic (Finnic): Estonia) (recipient) calques from German (source), as
in läbi-hammustamaÂ�‘bite through’ (lit. through-bite) < German durch-beißen ‘bite
through’ (lit. through-bite), where the pattern has been taken over but not the form
(AikhenvaldÂ�2006a:â•›25). Matter borrowing typically entails at least a partial overlap
with pattern replication in that when matter is borrowed at least some of the func-
tions of the linguistic forms are also taken over. A rare example of matter borrow-
ing without any pattern replication is the German word Handy ‘mobile phone’: the
word is supposedly a loan from English but, if so, the meaning has changed (cf. Sakel
2007:â•›26). A similar example is the French noun footing ‘jogging’ (Curnow 2001:â•›427),
which again is in effect an English word but with an entirely different meaning.
Very broadly speaking, matter borrowing tends to be more frequent in the recip-
ient language the more dominant the source language is. In other words, the more
displacive the contact situation, the more matter borrowing. Conversely, the more
balanced the contact situation, the more pattern replication we tend to get. This is of
course a gross simplification. Other highly relevant parameters are, for example, lan-
guage attitude. If a community is averse to incorporating ‘foreign’ elements in their lan-
guage, pattern replication will be more prominent than matter borrowing. There was,
for example, in the early twentieth century, a conscious effort to make Estonian less
German-like, which resulted in considerable restructuring in both lexicon and gram-
mar (Aikhenvald 2006a). Here the matter borrowings were more straightforward to
weed out, while the less obvious pattern replications were more elusive to these efforts.
404	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
These kinds of attempts at purism often, but by no means always, emerge when a com-
munity feels under threat; the language becomes a vital sign of identity, and speaking a
‘pure’ form of the language becomes an important statement of loyalty.206
13.2.1.3â•‡ Mechanisms of contact-induced change
The mechanisms by which new material enters a language may differ. Typically, but not
always, it starts with code-switching. Code-switching essentially means that speak-
ers use more than one language or variety in the same utterance, a rather common
phenomenon with bi- and multilinguals. Some examples of code-switching made by
myself between my own two mother tongues are (368a–c), where the code-switched
material is in italics.
		 Swedish/English code-switching
	 (368)	 a.	 page	 forty-nio	 to	 sjuttio-eight
					 -nine		 seventy-
			 ‘Page forty-nine to seventy-eight.’
		 b.	 det	 make-ar	 ingen	 sense
			 it	 make-pres	 indef.pron	 sense
			 ‘It doesn’t make any sense.’
		 c.	 jag	 vet	 inte	 om	 jag	 hinner	 men	 I’ll	 try
			 1sg	 know	 neg	 if	 1sg	 make.it	 but
			 ‘I don’t know if I’ll make it, but I’ll try.’  (source: personal experience)
In (368) my utterances contain both Swedish and English. The code-switched mate-
rial, the material in a different language from the one I started the utterance in, is
in italics. Notice that in (368b) I ended up inflecting the code-switched verb with a
Swedish verbal inflection (make-ar, pronounced /meɪkaɹ/).
When a sizeable proportion of the speakers engage in code-switching, especially
systematic code-switching, where certain features regularly get code-switched, lin-
guistic features may diffuse from one language to another. In other words, the feature
206.â•‡ An interesting confirmation of how bilingualism promotes matter borrowing over pattern
replication are the findings of Brown’s (1989) cross-linguistic survey of 148 languages on names for
weekdays. He found that in those societies where bilingualism had been promoted, for instance in
colonies where the indigenous population had been integrated in colonial culture to a certain extent,
weekday names were typically borrowed from the colonizers. This is especially evident in South
America, with weekdays typically having been borrowed from Spanish. However, in those colonial
settings where the indigenous population had generally not been integrated in colonial culture, and
where consequently bilingualism had been much more limited, weekday names had been created
by new coinages using only native linguistic materials. This is evident in North America, where
weekdays typically involved native coinages. For more details, as well as a hierarchy of weekday bor-
rowings, see Brown (1989).
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 405
may propagate. For more on the linguistic effects of code-switching, see, for example
Myers-Scotton (2002) with further references. For a very enjoyable exposé on various
myths and beliefs about multilingualism in general, see Cruz-Ferreira (2010).
A transferred form is essentially borrowed wholesale from one language into an-
other. The matter borrowing of Spanish entre into Guaraní mentioned above is an
example of a transferred form. Bound morphemes may also be transferred, as the
English suffix â•‚able < Old French.
An already existing tendency may be reinforced, or enhanced, by language con-
tact. This is especially true of displacive contact situations. In other words, if a domi-
nated language already has a tendency towards a construction, and the dominating
language has the same or a very similar construction, this construction is likely to
become reinforced in the grammar of the dominated language. In Pennsylvania Ger-
man, for example, already existing tendencies are ‘helped along’ by intense contact
with American English. Thus the common English ‘get-construction’ where get has an
auxiliary function that does not mean ‘receive’ has reinforced a similar construction
with kriege ‘to get, receive’ in Pennsylvania German:
		 Pennsylvania German (Indo-European (Germanic): USA)
	 (369)	 a.	 mir	 kriege	 gesaagt
			 we	 get	 told
			 ‘We get told.’
		 b.	 hen	 dir	 sel	 geduh	 geriegt
			 have	 you	 that	 done	 got
			 ‘Did you get that done?’  (Burridge 2006:â•›186f)
In (369) we have the construction kriegeâ•›+â•›past participle, where kriege functions as an
auxiliary in the same way as in the English ‘get-constructions’ (cf. the translations of
the examples). Enhancement is an example of pattern replication, where the pattern
is adopted but not the form.
A similar process is contact-induced grammaticalization, where a lexical item
in the recipient language grammaticalizes to match a grammatical category in the
source language (i.e. a pattern replication of a grammaticalization path). In Basque,
for example, the verb eraman ‘carry’ has taken the same grammaticalization path as
Spanish llevar ‘carry’ and grammaticalized into a perfect progressive marker (ex-
pressing ‘to have been doing something’) (Jendraschek 2006:â•›157). Here the recipient
language (Basque) follows the path of the source language (Spanish). The recipient
language may also by way of grammaticalization create a new category to match
an existing category in the source language. In the Arawakan language Tariana, for
example, the verb â•‚sita ‘finish’ has grammaticalized into a perfective aspect marker
matching existing categories in the East Tucanoan languages with which it is in con-
tact (Aikhenvald 2003:â•›12).
406	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
An already existing feature may also get extended in its function or use as an ef-
fect of language contact. In Mosetén (Mosetenan (Mosetenan): Bolivia), for example,
inanimates do not generally get marked for plural. This is, however, changing due to
the intense contact with Spanish, where animacy plays no role in the plural marking
of nouns (Sakel & Matras 2008). In this case the already existing plural marking of
nouns in Mosetén gets extended in use to all nouns. This is again an instance of pat-
tern replication, where the pattern of the dominating source language (Spanish) is
being taken over in the dominated recipient language (Mosetén).
An already existing linguistic feature that is similar in form to a linguistic feature
in the source language may get reinterpreted to take over the functions of the form
in the source language. Thus the recipient language grammatically accommodates
its feature to the functions of the similar sounding feature in the source language. In
Likpe (Niger-Congo (Kwa): Ghana), for example, TMA is marked by prefixes on the
verb, except for the present progressive which is expressed analytically. This is due
to intense contact with Ewe: the Likpe verb lɛ́ ‘hold’ sounds very similar to the Ewe
progressive marker le ‘be.at:present’ and has accommodated to become a present pro-
gressive marker. Compare the two constructions in Likpe and Ewe:
		 Likpe (Niger-Congo (Kwa): Ghana)
	 (370)	 ɔ-lɛ́	 ka-mɔ	 bo-té
		 3sg-hold	 cm-rice	 cm-sell
		 ‘She is selling rice.’  (Ameka 2007:â•›112)
		 Ewe (Niger-Congo (Kwa): Ghana)
	 (371)	 é-le	 mɔ́lu	 dzráx-ḿ
		 3sg-be.at:pres	 rice	 sell-prog
		 ‘She is selling rice.’  (Ameka 2007:â•›112)
Due to its superficial similarity in form to Ewe le, the Likpe lɛ́ ‘hold’ has been gram-
matically accommodated to have the same function as Ewe le in the source language
pattern, even though the semantics differ. This is essentially also a case of pattern
replication, although one could possibly argue that the similarities in form between
the feature in the recipient and the source languages trigger a passive kind of matter
borrowing.
Calques, or loan translations, are, as mentioned above, instances where the
recipient language copies a pattern of the source language but not the form. The
Manange (Sino-Tibetan (Bodic): Nepal) expression 2ta 3pi-nʌ ‘because’ (lit. ‘what say.
evidential’) is a calque from Nepali kina bhane ‘because’ (lit. ‘why say’) (Hildebrandt
2007:â•›293). Here, again, we have a case of pattern replication without any borrow-
ing of form. Borrowings may sometimes occur parallel to the native expressions,
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 407
Â�
sometimes called double marking. An example of double marking is the Mezquital
Otomí (Oto-Manguean (Otomian): Mexico) construction for repetition of an event,
where the native form [main verb + ma ‘nagi ‘again’] occurs parallel to the calqued
expression [pengi ‘return’ + main verb] < Spanish [volver a + main verb] (as in Volvió
a salir ‘He went out again’ lit. ‘(re)turn.3sg.preterit to go.out’):
		 Mezquital Otomí (Oto-Manguean (Otomian): Mexico)
	 (372)	 dá=pengi	 dá=uni	 ma ‘nagi
		 past.1sg=return	 past.1sg=give	 again
		 ‘I gave it to them again.’  (Hekking & Bakker 2007:â•›456)
In (372) the calqued construction (in bold) is used alongside the native construction.
Double marking, or parallel constructions, may serve to give ‘foreign’ constructions
an air of legitimacy and thus may ultimately lead to the integration of the construction
in the recipient language.
Borrowed matter may be reinterpreted and acquire new functions in the recip-
ient language. In Hup, for example, the borrowed matter niâ•‚ ‘be’ from Tukano diî
([nii]) ‘be’ is not only used for inferred evidentials, as in Tukano, but also as a ver-
balizer, a function for which Tukano has a different marker (Epps 2007:â•›558). Acholi
(Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Uganda) is an example of a language where borrowed matter
has been completely reinterpreted: the Karimojong gender markers áâ•‚ (feminine) and
ɛ́â•‚ (masculine) have been reanalysed as the Acholi number markers àâ•‚ (singular) and
èâ•‚ (plural). Compare the two languages in the example below:
		 Karimojong (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Uganda)
	 (373)	 a.	 singular	 plural
			 ɛ́-kìl-é	 ŋí-kíl-yók	 ‘man’	 (masculine)
			 á-bɛ́ɛ́rʊ́	 ŋá-berʊ̀	 ‘woman’	 (feminine)
			 í-kɔ̀kʊ	 ŋí-dwé	 ‘child’	 (neuter)
		 Acholi (Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic): Uganda)
		 b.	 singular	 plural
			 à-t̯ín	 è-t̯în-ɔ̀	 ‘child’
			 à-t̯ín-d̯yang	 è-t̯în-d̯ok	 ‘calf’
			 à-kwɔ́	 è-kʊ́w-é	 ‘thief’  (Storch 2006:â•›104f)
As can be seen in Example (373), the gender markers of the Karimojong source lan-
guage have been borrowed in form but have been reinterpreted as number markers in
the recipient language Acholi.
408	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
13.2.2		 Feature‘borrowability’
In principle any linguistic feature can diffuse from one language to another (or several
others). However, it seems as if some linguistic features are more prone to diffusion
than others. This section will give some examples of features that tend to diffuse. It
relies heavily on the findings of LCGB as discussed in Matras (2007).
13.2.2.1â•‡ Phonology
Typically through introduction of loan words, the phonology of the recipient lan-
guage may be altered. Most common seems to be the addition of phonemes, such
as /m/ in Basque which entered the language first via Celtic loans and was then
reinforced by subsequent loans from Latin (Trask 1998).207 Consonants seem more
prone to diffusion than vowels, which is probably due to the simple fact that conso-
nant inventories are typically larger than vowel inventories. Suprasegmentals, espe-
cially tone, also commonly diffuse. Thus many of the Tibeto-Burman languages that
have been or are in contact with Chinese languages (those in the ‘Sinosphere’) de-
veloped tone, as opposed to those Tibeto-Burman languages in the ‘Indosphere’, i.e.
in the Indic language area (LaPolla 2001:â•›234f). In fact there seems to be a tentative
tendency that suprasegmentals diffuse somewhat easier than segmental phonemes
(Matras 2007:â•›39).
13.2.2.2â•‡ Morphology
Bound morphemes may be borrowed, as was the case with the Acholi number mark-
ers in Example (373). Derivational morphemes seem to diffuse easily. For example,
the LCGB shows borrowing of a diminutive suffix into Macedonian Turkish, Yiddish
(Indo-European (Germanic): Central Europe), Imbabura Quechua, Purépecha, and
Rumungro (Indo-European (Indic): Czech Republic) (Matras 2007:â•›43).
Contact may also cause languages to move from one morphological type to an-
other. For instance, Indonesian has become increasingly more isolating under the in-
fluence of the various lingua franca varieties of Malay (Tadmor 2007:â•›308), while the
largely concatenative Likpe is increasingly relying on reduplication under influence
from Ewe (Ameka 2007:â•›110).
13.2.2.3â•‡ Nominal categories
Number marking seems to diffuse easily, while for example gender and case markers
do not. In fact, there are no instances of borrowed case markers in the LCGB (MatrasÂ�
207.â•‡ In fact, internal tendencies were also in place, whereby /b/ > /m/ and /nb/ > /m/. Contact thus
not only brought new lexicon with the phoneme into the language, but also reinforced an already
existing tendency. For more details see Trask (1998:â•›317f).
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 409
2007). However, Northern Tajik (Indo-European (Iranian): Tajikistan), which is not
in their sample, borrowed almost all case markers from Uzbek (Altaic (Turkic): Uz-
bekistan) (Doerfer 1966:â•›95). Classifiers seem susceptible to language contact; Hup
and Cantonese acquired systems similar to the languages they are in contact with
(Aikhenvald 2006a:â•›16), while the originally Bantu noun class system seems to have
diffused widely to other Niger-Congo languages and even beyond, to, for instance,
the Nilotic (Nilo-Saharan) language Luo in Kenya (Dimmendaal 2001:â•›377ff). While
Luo does not have classifier agreement marking on nominal modifiers, the Bantu
markers entered the language through extensive borrowing where the noun-class
prefixes were retained. Additionally, a language internal process, possibly reinforced
by the Bantu lexical influence, is seeing lexical heads develop into noun-class prefixes
(DimmendaalÂ�2001:â•›382).
13.2.2.4â•‡ Verbal categories
When it comes to verbal categories, especially TMA, there seems to be a hierarchy of
how categories are affected by language contact:
modality > aspect > future tense > (other tenses)  (Matras 2007:â•›46)
The further left on the hierarchy, the more likely it is that the category is prone to
contact-induced change, and the more likely matter borrowing is. In other words,
modality is most likely to be affected by language contact while tenses other than
the future are the least likely to be affected by language contact. Matter borrow-
ing also decreases in frequency further right on the hierarchy – contact-induced
changes in the future tense are thus likely to be pattern replications and not matter
borrowing. This typically also works as an implicational hierarchy in that if a lan-
guage has contact-induced aspect marking, then it will also have contact-induced
modality, and so on. There are, for example, numerous cases of diffused evidentials
and markers of obligation, such as the tense-evidential system of Tariana enclitics
modelled on the East-Tucanoan suffixes (Aikhenvald 2003) and the obligative tiene
que ‘must’ in Rapanui from Spanish (Fischer 2007:â•›391). Similarly, progressives and
completives seem to diffuse fairly easily, such as the Likpe progressive construction
in (370) above and the Indonesian completive sudah < Sanskrit śuddha ‘cleansed,
cleared, acquitted’ (Tadmor 2007:â•›315). For more examples, see Aikhenvald (2006a)
and Matras (2007).
Contact-induced change in valency generally involves pattern replication, as in
the Purépecha periphrastic passive modelled on the Spanish ser (‘be’)-construction
(Chamoreau 2007:â•›469); typically contact-induced change in valency involves rein-
forcement and extension of already existing features (Matras 2007).
410	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
13.2.2.5â•‡ Parts-of-speech
Nouns are more readily borrowed than verbs (Matras 2007), although there are nu-
merous examples of verb borrowings.208 When it comes to functional word classes,
adpositions seem to diffuse with relative ease, as, for example, ‘between’, which is the
most frequently borrowed adposition in the LCGB with Indonesian antara (< San-
skrit), Guaraní, Purépecha and Mezquital Otomí entre (< Spanish), Domari (Indo-
European (Indic): Middle East) bēn (< Modern Standard Arabic) (Matras 2007:â•›42).
Numerals may also be affected by contact-induced change. In fact, more than two
thirds of the languages in the LCGB have some kind of matter borrowing of numerals
(Matras 2007:â•›50). Jaminjung (Australian (Jaminjungan): Australia), for example, has
borrowed numerals higher than ‘3’ from Kriol (Creole (English-lexified): Australia;
Schultze-Berndt 2007:â•›381), while Katanga Swahili uses French numerals for dates (de
Rooij 2007:â•›130).
Pronouns are often thought to be quite resistant to diffusion, although a number
of cases of borrowed pronouns are known. The English they, them, their, for example,
were borrowed from Old Norse þeir (nominative), þeim (dative), þeir(r)a (genitive)
due to intense Scandinavian contact and replaced the Old English hi/hie, him, hira/
hiera respectively (see, for example, van Gelderen 2006:â•›57,â•›98). For more examples on
pronoun borrowing and a discussion on the origin of the Pirahã pronouns in particu-
lar, see Thomason & Everett (2005).
Conjunctions are extremely prone to diffusion. All the languages in the LCGB
have borrowed conjunctions. There seems to be a strong indication for an implica-
tional hierarchy:
but > or > and  (Matras 2007:â•›54)
While some languages in the database borrow only ‘but’ and ‘or’, none of them have
borrowed ‘and’ without having borrowed the other two conjunctions on the hierarchy.
Discourse markers also diffuse extremely easily, and while it is not an absolute
universal, it is fair to say that it is one of the categories most likely to be borrowed
208.â•‡ For more on the typology of verb borrowing, see Wichmann & Wohlgemuth (2008), who also
show that the kind of borrowing can serve as an indicator of the degree of bilingualism between the
languages. Wichmann & Wohlgemuth propose a hierarchy of borrowing strategies where incorpo-
rating a new verb by ways of a construction with a form of the native ‘do’ (or some other so-called
light verbs like ‘be’ or ‘make’, often in conjunction with a form of ‘do’) is at the top of the hierarchy
and indicates a high degree of bilingualism, while borrowing a whole paradigm (i.e. the verb includ-
ing its affixes, a rare strategy) is at the bottom of the hierarchy and indicates a low degree of bilin-
gualism. The two intermediate stages are what they call ‘Indirect insertion’ where an affix is needed
in the recipient language to integrate the borrowed verb and ‘Direct insertion’ where the verb stem
is simply borrowed and integrated in the grammar of the recipient language without any further
accommodation. For more details, see Wichmann & Wohlgemuth (2008).
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 411
between languages. Purépecha, for example, has, among other markers, borrowed the
Spanish pues ‘thus, then, well’ and bueno ‘well’, pronounced pwes or pos and wenu
respectively (Chamoreau 2007:â•›475).
13.2.3â•‡	 Linguistic areas
Consistent contact between languages may give rise to a linguistic area (also termed
Sprachbund, diffusion area, convergence area and adstratum relationship), which
essentially means that a group of not closely related languages in a delimited area
share a combination of structural traits. Areal features are thus a bundle of features
consistently found in the languages of a particular area. It is important to keep in
mind that different areal features may have different origins and have diffused to dif-
ferent degrees within a linguistic area. For a very accessible overview of areal linguis-
tics, see Campbell (2009).
A high number of linguistic areas of different sizes have been identified across the
world. Below, I list a few of the most well-known ones together with a few examples of
their distinctive traits, largely following the salient features listed in Campbell (2009).
It is beyond the scope of this section to discuss all the various linguistic areas that have
been identified world-wide. Apart from the linguistic areas discussed below, Europe
and ‘Standard Average European’ (see Haspelmath 1998 and subsequent), the South-
east of the USA (see Campbell 1997), the Amazon (see Aikhenvald & Dixon 1998 with
further references) in South America, the Central Andes (see Büttner 1983) in West-
ern South America, and many more are well-defined linguistic areas. Furthermore,
I am confining myself to only five distinctive traits per linguistic area, which for none
of the areas constitutes a complete list of salient features. Note that these features do
not necessarily need to be typologically rare; it is the fact that they occur in a cluster
that is of interest. It is also important to keep in mind that every feature of a linguistic
area does not necessarily occur in every single language of a linguistic area. For most
of the linguistic areas the number of languages included is too high to provide a list of
the individual names. Map 13.1 gives a rough indication of where the linguistic areas
discussed below are located. I stress again that this is only a small selection of the
known linguistic areas world-wide.
13.2.3.1â•‡ The Balkans
This was the first Sprachbund to be recognized by linguists and is perhaps the best-
known and discussed linguistic area. It consists mainly of Indo-European languages
of different genera, although Macedonian Turkish constitutes an exception. The
languages usually included in this area are Greek, Albanian (Albanian: Albania),
Serbian (Slavic: Serbia), Croatian, Bulgarian (Slavic: Bulgaria), Macedonian (Slavic:
Macedonia), Romanian (Indo-European (Romance): Romania), Bugurdži Romani
(Indo-European (Indic): Serbia) and Macedonian Turkish.

The circum-Baltic area includes at a minimum Estonian, Liv (Uralic (Finnic): Lat-
via), Lithuanian (Indo-European (Baltic): Lithuania), Latvian, Baltic German (IndoÂ�
-
EuropeanÂ�(Germanic): Germany), but other languages have also been included, such
as Finnish, Swedish, Karelian (Uralic (Finnic): Russia), Karaim (Altaic (Turkic):
Lithuania), Baltic Yiddish, and many more. In other words, the languages around
the eastern Baltic Sea area.

13.2.3.3â•‡ Ethio-Eritrea
The Ethio-Eritrean area (traditionally called the Ethiopian area) includes some Nilo-
Saharan languages such as Anywa (Nilotic: Sudan), Gumuz (Gumuz: Ethiopia), as
well as a number of Cushitic languages (among others Qafar (Eastern Cushitic: Ethio-
pia), Awngi (Central Cushitic: Ethiopia), Beja, Sidaama (Eastern Cushitic: Ethiopia)
and Somali), Semitic languages (among others Amharic, Ge’ez and Tigre in Ethio-
pia as well as Tigrinya in Eritrea) and Omotic languages (among others Kefa (South
Omotic), Wolaytta (North Omotic) and Yemsa (North Omotic), all in Ethiopia), all of
which belong to the Afro-Asiatic family. It is a large area that essentially comprises the
Ethiopian highlands and stretches into Eritrea as well as northern Kenya.
Below are a few of the most distinguishing features of the Ethio-Eritrean area. For
more details and further references see, for example, Ferguson (1976) and Zaborski

	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 415
(a branch of Uto-Aztecan), Mayan, Mixe-Zoque, Oto-Manguean, Tarascan, Toton-
acan, Xincan and Tequistlatec families, as well as the isolate Cuitlatec (Mexico).
The following five traits are shared by all languages in the Meso-American area.
For more details on other traits, shared by many but not all of the languages in the
area, and for further references see, for example, Campbell et al. (1986).
a.	 a vigesimal numeral system
b.	 possession of the type his-dog the man ‘the man’s dog’, as in Example (375):
		 Quiché (Mayan (Mayan): Guatemala)
	 (375)	 u-’i:ʔ	 le:	 ačih
		 his-dog	 the	 man
		 ‘the man’s dog’  (Campbell et al. 1986:â•›545)
c.	 relational nouns for locative expressions (such as at.my.back for ‘behind me’)
d.	 VO word order (despite being surrounded by OV languages)

house’ for ‘door’, ‘water-die’ for ‘thirst’ and many more (Campbell et al. 1986:â•›553)
13.3	 Language change in sign languages
Just like spoken languages, sign languages constantly change. Change may be due to
either internal or external factors. In other words, processes of grammaticalization are
identifiable in sign languages, just as they are in spoken languages. One major differ-
ence between spoken and signed languages is that sign languages are almost univer-
sally in intense contact situations: most signers live in a world entirely dominated by
spoken language(s).
In many cases grammaticalization in sign languages follows the same or similar
kinds of paths as grammaticalization in spoken languages, but there are some paths
that seem to be specific for signed languages. For an extremely accessible and thor-
ough investigation of grammaticalization paths in sign languages and in how far they
are parallel to those in spoken languages, see Pfau & Steinbach (2006a), which this
section relies a great deal on.
Noun > Pronoun. In both DGS and NGT the indefinite pronoun (‘one, some-
one’) < ONE^PERSON (with a reduced form of the numeral one) (Pfau & Steinbach
2006a:â•›31).
Verb > Auxiliary. In many sign languages the verb ‘finish’ has developed into an
aspect marker; for example, in LIS FATTO ‘finish/done’ > perfective aspect marker
416	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
(Pfau & Steinbach 2006a), while in ISL FINISH > completive aspect marker (Meir
1999). In ASL the future tense auxiliary < GO.TO (from the Old French Sign Lan-
guage (OFSL: France) PARTIR ‘leave’) and the modal auxiliary ‘must’ < OWE (from
OFSL IL.FAUT ‘must’).209 The latter path is particularly interesting, deriving ulti-
mately from the gesture of monetary debt, desemanticizing to a general meaning
of ‘owing’ and extending to a meaning of ‘obligation’. For more on ASL future tense
and modal markers, see Janzen & Schaffer (2002:â•›203ff), from where I have the above
examples.
Adjective > Auxiliary. The ASL modal auxiliary ‘can’ < STRONG (ultimately
from OFSL POUVOIR ‘be.strong’; Janzen & Shaffer 2002:â•›207ff). While many modal
auxiliaries denoting ability in spoken languages also ultimately derive from lexical
items denoting physical strength of capacity, they tend to grammaticalize via lexical
verbs and not adjectives (cf. Bybee et al. 1994).
Adverb > Auxiliary. In DGS, NGT and ISL ALREADY > perfective aspect marker
(Pfau & Steinbach 2006a).
Noun > Auxiliary. This grammaticalization path is not known for spoken lan-
guages. In DGS the so-called agreement auxiliaries, which are auxiliaries used with
non-agreeing (or non-directional) verbs (cf. 5.3), are derived from the noun PERSON
(Pfau & Steinbach 2006a:â•›28ff).
Noun > Complementizer. In DGS, for example, a phonologically reduced form
of the noun REASON functions as the complementizer ‘because’ (Pfau & Steinbach
2006a:â•›35f).
The ultimate origins of the future tense and modal auxiliaries mentioned above
seem to have been gestures, though their grammaticalization paths all went through
a lexical stage. A phenomenon specific to sign languages is the direct grammaticaliza-
tion of gestures: here the path goes straight from an iconic item to a grammatical item
without the intermediate step of fist having developed into a lexical item.210 Below are
a few examples (all from Pfau & Steinbach 2006a:â•›52ff unless otherwise indicated).
209.â•‡ “The historical link between OFSL and ASL is due to the fact that Thomas Gallaudet who
founded the first school for the deaf [in USA] (the American Asylum in Hartford, CT) in 1816 went
to Paris to learn signs and methods of instructing deaf children. Gallaudet returned to America with
Laurent Clerc, himself a deaf graduate of the Paris school. Woodward (1978) suggests that what is
now known as ASL constitutes, in large part, a mix of the lexicon and some elements of the grammar
of OLSF with an indigenous sign language used in the North-Eastern part of the USA at that time”
(Pfau & Steinbach 2006a:â•›18). This essentially makes ASL an OLSF-lexified creole. For more on the
history of ASL, see Lane (1984).
210.â•‡ But cf. the discussion on demonstratives in Diessel (1999a) mentioned above. This might pos-
sibly constitute an example of spoken language functional items entering the linguistic system with-
out the intermediate lexical stage.
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 417
Gesture (manual) > Classifier. The handle classifiers that are so common across
sign languages do not generally originate from nouns but from gestures. The FLOWERâ•‚Â�
classifier in DGS, for example, resembles the letter F while the noun flower is signed
with the fingers extending from a closed hand in an upwards movement. In other
words, there is no resemblance between the classifier and the noun.
Gesture (manual) > Question particle. The “palm-up” gesture that many speak-
ers use as a gesture when uttering a question has grammaticalized to question par-
ticles in many sign languages. In most sign languages it is used as a polar question
particle, but in IPSL the same gesture covers both polar and content questions.
Gesture (non-manual) > Negation. The non-manual side-to-side headshake has
grammaticalized in many sign languages into a sentential negator.
Gesture (non-manual) > Polar question marker > Topic marker. The non-
manual “communicative questioning gesture” (Janzen & Shaffer 2002:â•›212) of raised
eyebrows has developed into an obligatory polar question particle in many sign lan-
guages. This gesture may then extend to also become a topic marker, as it has in, for
example, ASL.
Sign languages are also susceptible to contact-induced change, just as spoken lan-
guages are. The difference between spoken and signed languages, however, is, as men-
tioned, the fact that virtually all sign languages are minority languages in a speaker
dominated society. The absolute majority of sign language users must be able to func-
tion in the spoken language of the society they live in; until recently many societies
even forced deaf and hard of hearing people to learn to speak the spoken language of
the society while the natural sign language was repressed. Most users of sign language
are thus bilingual (effectively bimodally bilingual, cf. Emmorey et al. 2005).
Linguistic contact with sign languages may be of two types: between different
sign languages, or between signed and spoken languages. Code-switching occurs in
sign languages as in spoken languages, and may either be between two sign languages
or between a signed and a spoken language. The latter case may be better termed as
code-blending (Emmorey et al. 2005), since they typically involve simultaneous sign-
ing and speaking. An example of a code-blend between spoken English and ASL is
the following:
		 Spoken English/ASL code-blend
	 (376)	 I	 [don’t]	 [think] he would	 [really]	 [live]
			 NEG	 THINK	 REALLY	 LIVE  (Emmorey et al. 2005:â•›666)
In (376) parts of the spoken utterance (indicated by square brackets) are accompanied
with signs (glossed in the conventional manner).
Borrowings may occur between sign languages as well as between spoken and
signed languages. Examples of borrowings between sign languages are country names,
418	 Introduction to Linguistic Typology
which are increasingly signed using the native sign of the language in question (the
CSL sign for CHINA is taken over in other sign languages, and so on). Other ex-
amples of lexical borrowings are the dialects of BSL found in Glasgow, Liverpool and
London where the Catholic Deaf community have borrowed from TCE, for example
the signs of YEAR and BABY.DAUGHTER (Sutton-Spence & Woll 1999:â•›220).
Examples of borrowings from spoken languages to signed languages are calques
such as ASL BOYâ•›+â•›FRIEND or HOMEâ•›+â•›WORK from spoken English boyfriend and
homework (Valli et al. 2005:â•›187). This essentially constitutes a case of pattern replica-
tion. Another example is the ASL past auxiliary < the spoken English prefix ex (Carol
Neidle, p.c. to Anthony Grant). An interesting case of matter borrowing from ASL to
spoken English has been reported by Valli et al. (2005:â•›187), whereby the non-manual
mouthing cha which accompanies signs for ‘large pile of papers’ or ‘thick book’ has
been heard in such utterances as I have cha homework.
Borrowings are not necessarily only of lexical nature. Many of the grammatical-
ized gestures are cases of contact-induced change. That is, the gestures are typically
found in the spoken languages surrounding the sign languages in question, and have
either been transferred into the sign languages or have enhanced an already existing
tendency.
	 13.4â•‡ Summary
All human languages change both due to internal and external factors. A major internal process
of language change is grammaticalization. Language external change is mainly due to contact
between languages.
The process of grammaticalization typically involves desemanticization, where the semantic
content of a lexical item is bleached, which allows the item to be extended in its contextual use.
This increases the frequency of use of the item, which in turn leads to decategorialization as well
as morphological and phonological erosion. Paths of grammaticalization usually involve lexical
items that grammaticalize into functional items. The starting point tends to be content words
that grammaticalize to function words, which may grammaticalize into clitics, which in turn may
grammaticalize into affixes. Eventually the item may erode to the point of loss. Grammaticaliza-
tion is overwhelmingly unidirectional.
Contact-induced change typically comes about due to bi- or multilingualism and code-
switching. There are different types of contact situations, the main difference boiling down to
dominance. In a balanced contact situation the languages in question are on a roughly equal
footing. In a displacive contact situation one language dominates over the other. In cases of ex-
treme dominance speakers may end up shifting to the dominating language, which ultimately
may result in the extinction of the dominated language.
	 Chapter 13.â•‡ Language change	 419
In principle, any feature may be borrowed from one language into another, but not all fea-
tures are equally prone to diffusion. Borrowings are generally of two basic types, matter borrow-
ing and pattern replication. Language contact may also induce grammaticalization.
Language contact may give rise to linguistic areas, where a geographically delineated area
contains several not closely related languages sharing a cluster of linguistic features that are not
found among the languages outside the linguistic area.
Sign languages are also subject to constant change, both by way of internal and external fac-
tors. In general, grammaticalization paths in sign languages tend to be similar to those in spoken
languages. A modality-specific path for sign languages is the grammaticalization of gestures to
grammatical categories without the intermediate lexical stage.
Almost all sign languages are in a situation where they are dominated by the spoken lan-
guages of the society in question. This typically leads to bimodal bilingualism which in turn
may lead to bimodal code-blending. Sign languages borrow from each other and from spoken
languages. Contact-induced grammaticalization of function categories by way of grammatical-
ization of gestures is attested in most known sign languages.

Languages cited in this book
The following lists the languages that were cited in the text of the book. It does not include the
languages of the various feature maps that were not mentioned in the text. The language name
is as it appears in the text; if this differs from the name listed in Ethnologue, the latter is given
in parentheses. Thus “Acoma (Keres, Western)” means that Acoma is the language name used in
the text of this book, while the same language is called Keres, Western in Ethnologue. The ISO
639-3 code for each language is given where available. For the sign languages the English names
are given. The locations are given as country names and should be seen as rough approximations.
The figures for the number of speakers are taken from Ethnologue unless otherwise specified,
and refer to the total for all countries given a particular language. The figures for the number of
speakers also refer to the whole language unless otherwise specified, i.e. are not broken down
into numbers for specific dialects. The year indicates when the figure for the number of speakers
was given; “NA” means that no estimate of number of speakers is available and “(n.y.)” means
that no year was given for the estimate in question.
