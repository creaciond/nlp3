people – be they English, Welsh, Scottish, Irish or Cumbrian – who are
charged with representing and promoting the interests of the United

the mid- to late-seventies.
CHAPTER TWO
ONCE UPON A TIME
Evil communications corrupt good manners.1
Plain Sense
Before relating to you how my English was improved, let us recall that
well over one hundred years ago, in 1891, the Permanent Under Secretary
of the Foreign Office wrote the following to the “Juniors” in the Eastern,
Western and American Departments:
You should not begin a sentence without knowing more or less how you are
going to get out of it. You should keep the request or suggestion as distinct
as you can. And you should read your Draft after you have written it, and
consider the effect on the reader at the other end.
I cannot help thinking that some of these elementary rules are
occasionally neglected; especially the last one. Perhaps it is on this
account that I now and then, - though now I am happy to say rarely – see
letters consisting of one huge centipede of a paragraph, wriggling its
length over two pages without a break, and saying that with reference to
something, enclosing something, stating something relative to somebody, I
am directed to transmit, to be laid before somebody else, a copy of
something, enclosing a copy of something else, reporting the answer which
has been returned; and I am to request that in laying these papers before
that somebody, you will move him to cause Lord Salisbury to be furnished
with any observations which may occur to him; and so on, with a dreadful
string of participles and relative pronouns, each dependent upon the
preceding phrase, resembling nothing in literature except the tale of the
house that Jack built. 2
He went on to stress the importance of shorter sentences and phrases.
For example, he wrote that “inform” was simpler than “cause to be
informed”.

Chapter Two
14
On entering Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service, I was sent on a
drafting course, run by what was then called “Training Department”, at
which I was given a book entitled The Complete Plain Words.3
I still have
it, and a slightly more anodyne, but still valid later edition, from 1987. The
book was not used on the course, but intended to serve as a reminder after
we had started our desk jobs. The key teaching material was contained in
an FCO booklet entitled Drafting – Plain Sense, and a supplement,
containing examples of good drafting. There was even a handout
summarising salient points. I shall not now reproduce the material, but
home in on important points, to give you the flavour of the course. The
foreword began by quoting Harold Nicolson: “…diplomacy is not the art
of amicable conversation but the technique of exchanging documents in
ratifiable form…any agreement which is committed to writing is likely to
prove more dependable in future4
than any agreement which rests upon the
variable interpretation of spoken assent.”
As to defining drafting, we were treated to the following: “Drafting, in
Office usage, covers much more than the Oxford English Dictionary
definition: ‘to draw up in a preliminary form’. It covers a whole technique
of communication, both among ourselves and between ourselves and the
outside world. As such, it is obviously important for our work. But it is
even more important for a less obvious reason. Not only do our drafts
convey our meaning, but the way we draft affects the very quality of our
thought. A clear drafter is nearly always a clear thinker. Conversely, most
people who can think clearly can teach themselves to draft. In practice the
two things go together: improving our drafting improves our thinking, and
improving our thinking improves our drafting: no one can tell which
comes first.”
Treated to this introduction, and following a pep talk, we put our noses
to the grindstone:

Do you need more information?
Do you need to consult anyone else before writing?

arrange it in the order in which he needs to know it.
Get your thought into logical order and deal with related
ideas together.

Thus introduced, we wrote exercise after exercise, looking at the good,
the bad and the ugly, improving drafts, and writing our own, after which
the course leader tore some of them to shreds – only metaphorically
speaking, of course. We were asked to check our standards as follows:
Can you answer “Yes” to the following questions about each thing you
write?

SOME WORDS AND PHRASES TO BE AVOIDED
(Showing acceptable alternatives where relevant)
“In relation to…” “On” or “As to”
“So far as…is concerned” “As to”
“Appreciate” “Recognise”
“Feel” “Consider”, “Think”
“The fact that…means that” “Since”
“Taking steps to do something” “Doing it”
“Be aware of” “Know”
“Prior to”, “Previous to” “Before”
“In short supply” “Short”
“In the intervening period” “Meanwhile”, “Since then”
“Of considerable importance” “Important”
“Respond favourably to” “Meet”, “Agree to”
“Utilise” “Use”
“Communication” “Letter, “telegram” etc.
“Hopefully” “I hope that”
Nothing is of course perfect. For example, I would substitute “scarce” for
“short”, as an alternative to “in short supply”.
Before looking at the FCO itself in the Seventies, let us end this brief
foray into incisive writing with a look at connecting words, by reproducing
a telegram from the FCO to Moscow, of 22 June 1939:
You are doubtless as bewildered as I am by the attitude of M. Molotov. The
position as I see it is that we have declared ourselves ready to give him the
substance of everything he requires, namely a guarantee to come to the
assistance of Russia should she be involved in hostilities owing to an act of
aggression by Germany on any of the Baltic States. As regards the form,
we have demurred to mentioning the Baltic States by name on the practical
ground that these states do not wish it, and that their declarations show
that if we disregard their wishes we shall alienate them and possibly even
drive them into the arms of Germany. This eventually is clearly in the
interests neither of ourselves nor indeed of Russia. It is consequently not
apparent why M. Molotov clings with such stubborn pertinacity to his
original draft, in which the various States are mentioned.
If the passage were re-read without the words in bold, it would take longer
to grasp its sense. Thus connecting words can be vital. Conversely, using
too many can also befuddle the reader’s brain. Some examples of useful
connecting words are “for instance”, “also”, “moreover”, “beyond this”,
“however”, “yet”, “but”, “at the same time”, “on the other hand”,
Chapter Two
18
“nevertheless”, “against this” (according to context), “it follows that”,
“therefore”, “thus”, “consequently”.
These few extracts from Drafting – Plain Sense show us how
fastidious the FCO was in its written communications training, to the point
where lazy intellects would have found it pedantic and boring. Yet it is this
very fastidiousness that trained many to improve their writing skills. As
we shall see later, plus ça change. Let us look at how new entrants to the
Diplomatic Service in the Seventies learned the tools of their trade.
The Third Room Word Factory
1975: my first job in Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service was as a desk
officer in what was then called “Marine and Transport Department”,
dealing with the “Cod War”, following which I moved to United Nations
Department to handle, among other things, the UN Environment
Programme. I was in what was then known as the “Third Room”. This was
the engine room of the department, where desk officers beavered away
drafting replies to parliamentary questions, writing briefs for delegations,
answering queries from ministers, drafting and replying to telegrams,
exchanging minutes with other members of the department or desk officers
in other departments, and replying to letters from members of the public,
usually on a minister’s behalf. Then there were policy meetings, as well as
regular departmental ones, known as “morning prayers”. The first thing I
did whenever I had to draft anything was to call for the file from the
registry, our written collective memory, to check on HMG’s policy.
Having formed a picture, I drafted, then submitting my draft via my out-
tray to the Assistant (actually the assistant head of department). He would
then amend by hand what I had written, show me the alterations, and
submit it to the Head of Department, who would if necessary add his
handwritten amendments. If the draft were to end up as a letter, policy
statement or answer to a written parliamentary question by a minister, it
would wend its way further up the tree to the relevant Assistant Under
Secretary, and perhaps to an Under Secretary, before being submitted to
the minister for signature. If it involved a particularly important or
sensitive matter, it might even be submitted to the Permanent Under
Secretary himself. The Desk Officer was able to see how his written work
had improved on the way to the top. Only minutes were not checked,
perhaps understandably, since they were initiated and signed by the desk
officer. There were three ways of producing any written work: one wrote
by hand, then passing it to the typing pool, one dictated to a shorthand
Once Upon a Time

19
typist, or one dictated into a machine, to be handed to the typist. The typist
gave it back, for our checking, before we submitted it upwards.
I was thus able to apply immediately and directly to my job what I had
gleaned on the drafting course. On top of that, a “float” would circulate
every day, with telegrams from posts all round the world, enabling us to
have not only an overview of world events (both back- as well as
frontstage!), but also to read how others were writing, which is itself a
lesson). Of course that was not all: for example, at one weekly
departmental meeting, a desk officer used the word “ongoing”, whereupon
the head pointed out to the recalcitrant colleague that the verb “ongo” did
not exist, explaining that the word “continuing” was the correct one. The
offender never used the word “ongoing” again. Nor did I, and nor do I.
This particular head of department also issued a dictum that split
infinitives would not be tolerated. And he sent a minute to the rest of the
department saying that we must not write “connection”, but “connexion”,
as The Times did. That was then. But I still remember. A final comment on
“ongoing” was sent to me by a former ambassador, the very man who was
criticised above:
I notice that 'on-going' (with a hyphen) is now in the Oxford Dictionary.
So, in some respects, I feel vindicated! But I do notice that the word is so
often misused, or used when not necessary, so it is probably still best to
avoid it. For example, the radio often reports a traffic jam caused by the
'on-going road works'. But, if you think about it, the word 'on-going' is
superfluous because only the road works are causing the traffic jam. If the
works were not on-going there would be no traffic jam! Worse still, I hear
so many references on the TV or radio to some event described as 'an on-
going situation'. It just seems very sloppy.
The same man later sent me another priceless comment:
Some incisive valedictories were still being written in 2006 (eg Ivor
Roberts', Andrew Green's), so the high standard of English was still being
maintained then in parallel with the management-speak. The tragedy is
that, having subsequently banned them, the wider audience within the FCO
will have little or no access, I assume, to clear and precise analyses as
used to be committed to despatches circulated quite widely in the Office.
Reading these despatches was, as you say, a very useful learning tool for
young FCO people. Sadly, this particular tool was withdrawn and will be a
loss to present and future generations of young FCO people.
CHAPTER THREE
MORE SPEED, LESS QUALITY,
AND THE DESCENT INTO SLOPPINESS
I’m a word merchant: I pay for my misdemeanours in syntax.1
Fast-food Learning
Now things are very different. The registry no longer exists, the typing
pools have disappeared, and ambassadors no longer write valedictory
despatches. Despatches as a whole are disappearing. With the slow but
inexorable introduction of the desktop computer, e-grams (the first one
was sent in 2004) have replaced telegrams, and minutes are e-mailed to
colleagues, sometimes in the same room. Since there are no registries, it is
far more difficult to “access the file”: instead, there is a series of
cumbersome electronic steps to be gone through. Although all
communications are meant to be registered, the procedure is far too time-
consuming for most officers to bother to register a minute, letter or e-
gram. In the serious days, whenever one read a letter, telegram or report,
and had acted on it, one wrote either “pa” (“put away”) or “BU” (Bring
Up’) with a date. Before filing the paper, the registry clerk would note the
“BU” date, and give the file to the desk officer on the desired date. All that
is gone. According to a recently retired ambassador, the collective memory
has gone, and most written work is done “on the hoof”. Where once the
FCO had three personnel departments, namely Personnel Operations
Department, Personnel Services Department and Personnel Policy
Department, there is now a “Human Resources Directorate”. Where there
was once Training Department, we now have the same Human Resources
Directorate, which includes a Recruitment and Development Department,
including in turn a Learning and Development “Team” (the very “team”–

22
see appendix – that stonewalled for so long on obtaining some simple
documents from the early 2000s, to enable me to write this book). A
human resource (person) no longer benefits from week-long – and longer
– drafting courses. Following the demise of the course described above,
the new-fangled Learning and Development Team offered until recently
two writing courses, “Effective Writing”, a one-day course followed by a
one-hour coaching session, and “Writing with Impact”, a half-day course
followed by a one-and-a-half hour individual (or “one to one”, as an FCO
official wrote to me!) coaching session. Both were provided by external
sources, rather than by recently retired diplomats, as before. And even
these pale shadows of past solidity ended on 30 April 2012, and are now
offered through “Civil Service Learning”. Thus, much of the FCO’s past
expertise in training has been subsumed into the broader Civil Service, and
partly stultified. As for The Complete Plain Words, it has not been offered
to new entrants for some years.
The upshot of all this is that diplomats meet each other far less during
their working day, huddled as they are in front of their computers. On-line
meetings also often replace face-to-face meetings. Electronic communication
substitutes for natural communication. The American spell-check, based
on American operating systems and Windows has by and large replaced
the draft wending its way upwards to be perfected. There is far less
formality. Only older members of the service sign letters to their
homologues with “Yours ever”, as was once the accepted custom. As for
the enjoyable quick gossip sessions in the Registry, they have been killed
off.
America
Lest anyone think that I am suffering a bout of nostalgia, think again. I
am simply enunciating my arguments suggesting that the quality of FCO
written language is under great threat, and why. Later on, we shall connect
this to the socio-political changes in British – but mainly English – society
that have occasioned this poisoning of clarity and common sense. It is of
course true that there have always been critics of changes in the English
language – even Shakespeare came under attack –, but this book is about
the devastating effects of the misuse of technology, combined with
political correctness and the fashionable but otiose Americanisation of our
lives, and how the FCO is becoming unconsciously American in its
outlook and policy formulation. The changes caused by the advent of
printing, and that of the typewriter some five hundred years later, are like a
Girl Guides tea party, when juxtaposed with what is now happening. Of
More Speed, Less Quality, and the Descent into Sloppiness

course, this typical English gut aversion to the Americanisation of our
language is not that new, as the following extracts from a book by
Lawrence Durrell, writing about his experiences at the British Embassy in
Belgrade in the early fifties, suggest:
“I suddenly thought ‘My God, in Polk-Mowbray we have witnessed the
gradual destruction of an Ambassador’s soul’ “.
I was startled by this observation.
“I mean”, went on Antrobus, “that gradually, insidiously, the
Americans got him.”[…] “I remember now”, I said, “committing the
terrible sin of using the phrase ‘the present set-up’ in a draft despatch on
economics.”(It came back gashed right through with the scarlet pencil that
only Governors and Ambassadors are allowed to wield – and with
something nasty written in the margin.)
“Ah,” said Antrobus, “so you remember that. What did he write?”
“ ‘The thought that members of my staff are beginning to introject
American forms into the Mother Tongue has given me great pain. I am
ordering Head of Chancery to instruct staff that no despatches to the
Foreign Secretary should contain phrases of this nature.’ ”[…]
“But Nemesis”, said Antrobus, “was lying in wait for him”[…]
“But Nemesis. What form did he take?”
“She, old man. She. Nemesis is always a woman. Polk-Mowbray was
sent on a brief mission to the States in the middle of the war.”
“Ah.”
“He saw her leading a parade wrapped in the Stars and Stripes and
twirling a baton. Her name was Carrie Potts. She is what is known as a
majorette. I know. Don’t wince. No, he didn’t marry her. But she was a
Milestone, old fellow. From then on, the change came about, very
gradually, very insidiously. I noticed that he dropped the Latin tag in his
drafts. Then he began to leave the ‘u’ out of words like ‘colour’ and
‘valour’. Finally, and this is highly significant, he sent out a staff circular
saying that any of the secretaries caught using phrases like quid pro quo,
sine qua non, ab initio, ab ovo and status quo would be transferred. This
was a bombshell. We were deprived at a blow of practically our whole
official vocabulary […] By God, you’d never believe it, but I kept coming
across expressions like ‘set-up’, frame-up’, ‘come-back’, and even
‘gimmick’. “2
Notwithstanding this humorous, but nevertheless incisive, approach, the
Americanisation of English English clearly rankled in the breasts of many
a clear communicator. In the 1973 edition of The Complete Plain Words,
we read:

Chapter Three
24
When we consider that American English has been assaulting these shores
with ever-increasing weight and persistence for many years, through films,
magazines, radio and television, to say nothing of American service-men
and American tourists, we may well marvel at the sturdy resistance put up
by British popular usage […] What we are concerned with here is the
extent to which those who write British English and who ‘use words as
tools of their trade in administration or business’ should allow themselves
to be influenced by the assaults of American English. They should not, I
suggest, put up any resistance to words which aptly fill a real need – as did
teenager, doodle and commuter, now well established in British English
[…] Nor do I see any harm in the newly coined guesstimate, meaning an
estimate so rough that it is little better than a guess […] There is no sense
in preferring transportation to transport or envision to envisage. Nor
should they be seduced by such ungainly temptresses as in the event that
(if), at this time (now) or as of now (now)[…] In Britain boy meets girl and
should continue to do so, even though in America he meets with her, or
even meets up with her. (Meet with, in British English, is used only where
what is met is abstract – a man can meet with opposition and an expedition
can meet with disaster – and even there meet is often used alone. Of course
one can meet force with sweet reason or disaster with courage but those
are different constructions.) Consult with and visit with are other
Americanisms which should be made unwelcome; consult and visit should
not be rendered impotent […] The American assault is made not only
directly through American English but also indirectly through ‘United
Nations’ English. Many of the publications of the United Nations, of their
specialised agencies and of other international bodies bear eloquent
witness to the prominent and influential part played in their activities by
the United States. Just as we cannot reasonably object to the use of
American English by Americans, so we cannot reasonably object to the use
of United Nations English by the United Nations. But that is not to say that
we should allow either to influence British English for the worse […] But
these differences in usage do not present nearly so serious a menace as the
tortured polysyllabic style of much American official and academic writing
– what President Roosevelt stigmatised as ‘gobbledygook’. Here the
British resistance has been by no means as sturdy as one could wish. 3
So far, so good: by 1986, the revised edition of Gowers, although it
reprinted most of the above, had amended “assaulting these shores” to
“invading these islands”. Significantly, however, I can find no post-1986
edition, bar one Penguin one for 1987. That is twenty-nine years to 2015.
Nor, as mentioned above, is it given to new entrants to the Diplomatic
Service. Clearly, Thatcher’s higher education changes, the erosion of the
grammar schools, Major’s “classless society”, “ Blair’s” “Cool Britannia”

and Cameron’s “fairer and multicultural Britain” have not been kind to
clear English. Americanisation has not only made English more
linguistically confused, but has simultaneously accompanied American
policies not only on defence, but in matters such as the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender phenomenon, which originated in America, and
which Cameron wishes to export by sending his ministers to “fan out
across the globe to spread gay marriage.” 4
The Polish civil rights
ombudsman protested recently that ambassador Todd had exceeded his
authority in promoting a “UK Guide to Gay, Bi-sexual and Transgender
People and their Rights (LGBT)”. Far from explaining, or at least
justifying this form of one-sided (what about heterosexual rights?)
advertising, the FCO pompously replied that it “has a policy of promoting
LGBT rights abroad.” One is bound to ask, perhaps a mite facetiously,
whether the FCO would promote heterosexual rights as well, just to
balance matters. Apart from that, whether such messages are
communicated effectively by our diplomats, or should even be
communicated at all, is a moot point.
Leaving the export of sexual habits, but just for now, let us look at
recent examples of Americanisation in the FCO. In late 2010, The
Spectator published a small critique, from which it is worth quoting:
A friend of mine has just come back from a few days of Civil Service
inhouse training. He managed in no time to get the hang of the exercise.
Namely, the mastery of another language. Not a foreign language, which
might have been handy, but not English either. ‘I learnt’, he said proudly,
‘about “brain-friendly learning”, “career pathing”, “energy management”
and – my absolute favourite – “impact residue”, which is what you leave
behind when you have met someone: what the uninitiated would call a
lasting impression. I was encouraged to “flex my styles” and identify
“meta-objectives”. In short, I am a new man,’ In other words, he’s learned
management-speak […] I came across a little booklet issued by the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office for the use of its staff. It was a fine
example of the genre. It was called Stakeholder Engagement, and it came
with the imprimatur of Peter Ricketts, the department’s permanent under-
secretary, and David Milliband, then the foreign secretary. Under the new
government the Stakeholder Engagement Team which generated it is going
strong and there is, for good measure, a ‘network of stakeholder
managers’. The introduction set the tone.
‘Stakeholder management’, it declared, ‘is the core of diplomacy and
service delivery. We have engaged many of our stakeholders in the
development and delivery of our objectives. We must continue to do this

across the board in a strategic, systematic and innovative manner. It
doesn’t actually say what a stakeholder is. Just that his management is the
core of ‘service delivery’. Four paragraphs down, we do get a definition of
a stakeholder, as ‘those organisations and individuals who can affect the
achievement of FCO’s objectives…we must engage with…stakeholders
that have most potential influence.’ I showed it to a friend who used to
work in the Foreign Office and he said tersely: ‘It means we should be
talking to, when and how.’5
As if that was not enough, a few days later, The Economist – despite it
being economically liberal à l’Américaine in its business outlook–wrote:
Friends of mine inside the Foreign Office concur with this gloomy
assessment of their youngest colleagues, who, though bright and often
expensively educated – struggle to write English with clarity, let alone
flair.
I wonder if blaming the juniors is entirely fair. My experience is that
even rather grand figures in the world of foreign policy have been steeped
in jargon and human resources gibberish for ages. I was recently at a
private meeting for diplomats and foreign policy types (I had better not say
where). It was a festival of what one ambassador I know calls “bullshit
bingo”, with certain buzzwords coming up again and again.
The worst? “Going forward” has infected the world of diplomacy just
as thoroughly as the world of business, as has talk of “stakeholders”.6
While we are on the subject of “bullshit bingo”, let us reproduce an extract
from the valedictory dispatch, dated September 2006, written by Sir Ivor
Roberts, the ambassador to Italy:
But the culture of change has reached Cultural Revolution proportions
with no opportunity to put down roots. The recent criticisms of the FCO
are disturbing. Chris Patten mused that it was 'sad to see experienced
diplomats trained to draft brief and lucid telegrams […] terrorised into
filling in questionnaires from management consultants by the yard […]
and expected under Orwellian pressure to evince enthusiasm for this
work'. The former foreign policy adviser to John Major, Rodric
Braithwaite, claims that No.10 had reduced the Foreign Office to a
'demoralised cypher' while a recent INDEPENDENT editorial asked 'What
is the Foreign Office for?'. Tempting as it is to brush aside such comments
as unconstructive, perhaps we need to ask whether they have a point? Can
it be that in wading through the plethora of business plans, capability
reviews, skills audits, zero-based reviews and other excrescences of the

management age, have we [sic] indeed forgotten what diplomacy is all
about? Why have we failed to explain so signally to the Cabinet Secretary
that well-conducted diplomacy cannot properly be measured because
diplomatic successes are often more than not elusive or ephemeral? The
diplomat is condemned to a Sisyphean task in which, as (s)he attempts to
grapple with one conflict, another breaks out. We manage or contain
disputes; very rarely do we deliver a quantifiable solution. Indeed we
should be sceptical of 'permanent' solutions or models: think democracy in
the Middle East or war on terror. Diplomacy is the classic example of the
Spanish proverb, ‘Traveller, there are no roads. Roads are made by
walking.' We need to keep flexible and innovative and be less worried
about strategic priorities which may need to be displaced at short notice or
added to with no commensurate additional resources. Priorities and
objectives have their place, clearly, but an excess of them smacks of a
command economy with its long and inglorious pedigree.7
This is almost a summary of much of what this book is about, and skillful
into the bargain. In one fell swoop of cogent, concise, clear, correct and
yet imaginative English, Roberts demolishes the verbally bloated,
politically correct and sloppy world of Blair’s “Cool Britannia”. Not long
after the despatch became known, valedictory despatches were banned,
thus dealing a dreadful blow not only to historians, but also to the right of
ambassadors to really speak their minds just before retirement. Banning
constructive self-criticism leads to arrogance. Perhaps worst of all is the
fact that future generations of British diplomats will no longer be able to
benefit from reading despatches.
Unfortunately, it gets worse: just as parents are often to blame for their
children’s misdemeanours, so are senior diplomats for the vagaries of their
younger colleagues. The March 2014 edition of the FCO Association’s
Password Magazine features an interview of – hold your breath – the
Chief Operating Officer, one Matthew Rycroft. The position that he fills
was once known as that of Chief Clerk. He can be fairly described as a
reasonably senior diplomat, responsible for the FCO’s administration, the
sort of chap who should set an example to younger colleagues. Herewith
some extracts of the written interview:
The culture has changed. We are less hierarchical, more open to the
outside, creative and confident. We no longer have a large central HR
function working out what is best for each individual and posting them
there whatever their personal preferences. Instead, each individual needs
to take responsibility for their own career. This approach, much closer to a

free market, combined with the introduction of Assessment and
Development Centres for key promotion points, has transformed the
culture to put much greater emphasis on leadership and management
skills. The pendulum is swinging back a bit at the moment, with renewed
emphasis on expertise and skills. We need to keep the organisation up to
date and adjust regularly. Working practices have changed. IT has
transformed how, where and when we work and has prompted a dramatic
shift from paper to electronic communication. Flexible working is now
embedded into the culture of the organisation. Personally, I work from
home in my current role most Fridays, and use the train journeys to work
on my Restricted blackberry which is synched to my desktop and laptop.
Digital tools have transformed our external engagement – how we get our
views across and how we listen to others. We have an extensive digital
presence - including 200 country sites – in over 30 languages; 6 Ministers
and 80 Ambassadors are on Twitter [...] Our work is now more tightly
focussed on our priorities, which are more clearly articulated than used to
be the case. We are gradually moving away from traditional ‘desk officer’
roles covering one topic or region towards more flexible staffing and a
project-based approach to policy delivery. Our buildings have changed
too. In the UK, we are moving – more slowly than most Government
Departments - towards an 8 to 10 ratio of desks to people, with more hot
desking to make maximum use of our space [….] We are working hard to
achieve ‘Diplomatic Excellence’, our reform and improvement agenda,
with the ambition of being the best Diplomatic Service in the world by
2015 […] Our vision for 2015 is that the FCO will be an ambitious,
confident and creative organisation, highly rated for its policy analysis
and action-orientated delivery […]. In my current role I have been leading
work to join up the whole British Government’s efforts overseas. I set up
and chair a Network Board with my opposite numbers from the main
Government Departments with staff overseas. We are driving forward an
ambitious agenda to improve joining up of policy delivery teams through
single country business plans and strategies, and to improve collaboration,
co-location, consolidation of corporate services teams, and the
harmonisation of terms and conditions […] In general, careers are more
fluid than they used to be, and we need to make it easier for people to come
and go. The world is changing very fast, and people’s expectations and
aspirations are also changing. Not all those joining today will wish to stay
with us for their entire career. But for those that do, plenty of opportunities
exist to carve out a challenging, rewarding and interesting career. Because
of the reduction in the size of the whole Civil Service that I mentioned
earlier, there is a Civil Service wide recruitment freeze for all grades
except the C Band (Grades 7/8 in old speak). We continue to take in
around 25-40 C Band staff every year, and it is one of the highlights in my
current role to meet them as part of their induction….. But I recognise that
this [esprit de corps] is one area on which retired staff often say that
things aren’t the same now as in their day. And it’s also an issue that is

affected by the economic climate. So let me try to describe aspects of the
esprit de corps that I feel and see around the globe today. In last year’s
staff survey, our overall 'engagement' score, based on five questions
showing how positive, attached and motivated our staff feel, rose to 68%.
It was 10 points above the Civil Service average. So I think staff do
generally feel motivated and proud to work for the FCO, despite the
pressures that austerity and an ever increasing workload have placed on
us all.8
Lost Freedom and Bismarck’s Prediction
The above is simply American business English. Rycroft might as well be
giving a pep talk to the sales team of a US corporation. Before we
comment on his words, let us bear in mind the rôle of language in the
USA’s enormous influence on British foreign policy. It is generally
established that Anthony Eden’s Suez debâcle marked the end of Britain’s
independence vis-à-vis the US. Since then, this independence in foreign
and defence policy (and it is not easy to separate the two, at least in the
case of the US) has been constantly eroded. Britain leased Diego Garcia to
the US in 1966, agreeing to expel its British subjects, then gassing their
animals for good measure. When Britain tried to give up its sovereign base
areas in Cyprus in the aftermath of the Turkish invasion of 1974, the US
simply forbade it, and the FCO succumbed, citing Kissinger’s views that
Cyprus was an important piece of real estate on the world chessboard, and
important in the Arab/Israel dispute.9
. Then there was the infamous Iraq
saga. Although it could be argued that Britain could have had the freedom
to join France and Germany and to refuse to attack, “Blair’s shoulder to
shoulder” strutting and clear adoration of President Bush put paid to any
serious thoughts of independent action. But the deputy legal adviser of the
FCO, Caroline Wilmshurst, did have the courage to resign. Since then, as
our language has become increasingly electronified, sloganised and
commercialised, so has our foreign policy.
To analyse and evaluate Britain’s instinctive submissiveness to the
USA in security, defence and foreign policy matters would require a book,
but one can at least consider for now the importance of UK-US

investments, as well as atavistic factors such as the Norman invasion, the
One Hundred Years’ and Napoleonic Wars, the concomitant identification
of France with the idea of a strong Europe (de Gaulle still rankles), and a
natural English disinclination to share too much with the Continent. De
Gaulle actually said that Britain did not have its own foreign policy, while
an admirer of his, Edward Heath, the last of the Brito-European Mohicans,
said that Britain piggy-backed American foreign policy. Most germane for
the theme of this book, however, is Bismarck’s prediction that the most
significant event in the twentieth century would be the fact that the North
Americans spoke English. I am inclined to wonder whether one of the
most significant events of the twenty-first century will be the fact that the
British speak North American.
Today, Britain needs US permission to fire cruise missiles; cannot
question US rights to US bases on British territory 10
; expelled two
thousand of its own subjects from the Chagos Islands on US insistence
(see above); and even sold its MOD research arm to a US conglomerate. In
2009, Britain’s nuclear research facility at Aldermaston was “handed over
to the Americans”, the announcement being made while Members of
Parliament were on their Christmas break, so as to avoid potentially
embarrassing discussion in Parliament.11
Let us now return to the brave new world of the FCO’s Chief
Operating Officer, quoted above.
Twitting
Matthew Rycroft was Private Secretary to Mr. Blair between 2002 and
2005. One is tempted to wonder whether it was this experience, rather than
his degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from Merton College, Oxford,
that accounts for his somewhat simplistic linguistic approach above. The
former ambassador who sent me Password Magazine wrote that it was full
of “managing change” claptrap. Let us take a serious look at the words,
bearing in mind my view that to a certain extent, some of the Chief
Operating Officer’s words are shiny soundbites, therefore detracting from
intrinsic and clear meaning. He says: “The culture has changed. We are
less hierarchical, more open to the outside, creative and confident.” In fact,
from my own experience, the FCO has become less open to the outside.
As a desk officer, I would talk on the telephone to members of the public,

as well as answer their letters (within one week, as stipulated in
Diplomatic Service Procedure). Now, it is far more difficult for members
of the public to get through to people. Even retired ambassadors have
difficulties, so I am told, unless they have a telephone number and a
personal contact. As for obtaining simple and uncontroversial documents,
I have included as an appendix the correspondence on how I managed to
obtain a small batch of documents to enable me to write this book. It took
me seventeen months to obtain them, despite the fact that the people with
whom I dealt were friendly and polite. The impression I gained was one of
incipient institutional coagulation and confusion, with some people no
longer having a clear idea of their precise rôle. Thus the “changed culture”
to which Rycroft refers does not appear to reflect “being more open to the
outside, and creative and confident”. Quite the opposite, in fact. As to the
word “culture”, it has itself transmogrified into a virtually meaningless
bromide.
He writes that we are moving away from traditional “desk officer”
roles covering one topic or region towards more flexible staffing and a
project-based approach to policy delivery. But he does not explain how the
demise of the desk officer will contribute to his vaunted “renewed
emphasis on expertise and skills”. The image that comes to my mind is of
a strongly built castle that is demolished and then reconstructed with the
same materials, but as an open plan camp, with “hot desking”. By “hot
desking”, the Chief Operating Officer presumably means “shared desks”.
He continues: “We no longer have a large central HR function working
out what is best for each individual and posting them there whatever their
personal preferences. Instead, each individual needs to take responsibility
for their own career. This approach, much closer to a free market,
combined with the introduction of Assessment and Development Centres
for key promotion points, has transformed the culture to put much greater
emphasis on leadership and management skills.” Apart from the incorrect
use of “their” instead of “his/her” (forgive my pedantry), to suggest that
each individual needs to take responsibility for his own career is mildly
fantastic, since this implies an excess of logic leading to a free-for-all,
when the fact of the matter is that there is a grading structure, and that the
higher the grade, the more authority one has. After all, many Diplomatic
Service people would love to be posted to Brussels, Paris or Rome, but
few to Haiti. The question obviously arises as to who decides. Clearly, it is
not the individual, although he may be asked for his preferences. This
connects to Rycroft’s later statement that careers are more fluid, and that
“we need to make it easier for people to come and go”. In a business
organisation, this might hold true, but to transform the FCO into a flexible

32
body, where people can simply move in and out detracts from
professionalism, solidity and, above all, the collective memory so vital to
quality, living continuity, and understanding British interests. As for the
reference to the free market, this is a giveaway. An organisation funded by
the taxpayer cannot, by very definition, be an integral part of the free
market, since the latter depends on what investors want: one cannot buy
shares in the FCO. At least, not yet.
Rycroft proudly tells us that six ministers and eighty ambassadors are
on Twitter, almost as if this is the be-all and end-all of successful
diplomacy and communication. Yet it is well known how controversial
Twitter can be, and that it can lead to all kind of spats, not to mention
being open to attack from virtually any quarter. Twitter is essentially a
private game, for people to bloat their egos. Those who use it to promote
their official views or careers open themselves to unwarranted attacks
from cranks and enemies. To imply that it is a useful part of diplomacy is
off-beam. It can actually lead to a dissipation of seriousness, and is but a
cheap substitute for serious analysis and evaluation, so vital to the
formulation of policy. For even if there is still some traditional formulation
of policy, it is surely being eroded subliminally in the minds of those
responsible for the interests of the United Kingdom.
Diplomatic Excellence?
“We are working hard to achieve ‘Diplomatic Excellence’, our reform
and improvement agenda, with the ambition of being the best Diplomatic
Service in the world by 2015. […] Our vision for 2015 is that the FCO
will be an ambitious, confident and creative organisation, highly rated for
its policy analysis and action-orientated delivery […]”. Here, I feel
constrained to ask some rhetorical questions: Exactly how is he going to
determine in 2015 whether the British Diplomatic Service has become the
best in the world? And since he appears to have accepted that there are still
some better diplomatic services, which are they? What are the criteria of a
good diplomatic service, and indeed the qualities of an effective diplomat?
In other words, is there any intrinsic meaning in his claims? And what on
Earth is “action-oriented delivery?” Can you deliver anything without
action? What is “delivery”? Passing a message to an audience accurately?
Convincing people? Justifying the bombing of Iraq? Having a large number
of responses on Twitter? Because Twitter is restricted to short comments,
does this not detract from serious analysis, let alone evaluation? Perhaps the
zombie apocalypse is already upon us, as we sleepwalk into “action-oriented
delivery” and “benchmarkable deliverables.”

Without wishing to be nasty about the words of a clearly intelligent
and successful Chief Operating Officer, how is he going to answer the
valid questions that I have asked? Should he lose some “performance
pay”, another import from the business world, that substitutes for annual
pay rises?12
And who, according to him, are the FCO’s audiences? Given
the business language used, one would assume shareholders. But there are
none, unless the FCO is due for privatisation. And this latter should not be
taken as my being facetious or frivolous. After all, parts of the Ministry of
Defence have already been privatised. For example, as mentioned above,
the Government sold the MOD research arm to a US conglomerate, and in
2009, its nuclear research facility at Aldermaston was sold to US
shareholders.
Death of the Despatch and Serious Thinking
No sane person would claim, even today, that Twitter is a good substitute
for a diplomatic despatch. Although the despatch was only for internal
consumption, expressing on paper one’s true thoughts and feelings about
foreign policy to colleagues is now obviously no longer the order of the
day. Indeed, as we have seen above, valedictory despatches have been
banned. In fact, most other kinds are also on their way out. Thus, Twitter
can at least serve a purpose, even if nefarious: ambassadors and others can
give vent to their frustrations, as long as they do not compromise security.
Let us now kill two birds with one stone: quote from a valedictory
despatch from Sir Andrew Green “To Saudi Arabia and the Service”, and
display what much of this book is about.
I have viewed with dismay the spread of 'Political Correctness' in recent
years. Intellectual honesty is the foundation of our Service; Political
Correctness its antithesis. 'Diversity' is the latest of several rather fatuous
fashions. The truth is that diversity is irrelevant to diplomacy. No foreigner
I have ever met cares whether the Service has fifty per cent women, ten per
cent homosexuals and five per cent ethnics. His (or her) only interest is
whether a diplomat has something useful to contribute. Furthermore,
'targets' are but a thinly disguised form of positive discrimination; this
undermines the fundamental principle of public service that promotion

Performance Pay is itself quite a topic for discussion. It was introduced instead
of annual pay rises in order to save money but, at the same time, to provide the
old-boy network with the highest performance pay while passing on a few
percentage points to some others lower down the hierarchy and nothing at all to the
lowest in the hierarchy, with perhaps one or two exceptions to make it look as
though it was operated fairly.
Chapter Three
34
should be based on ability alone. The risk is that 'minorities' will be
promoted because they are (just) credible, not because they are the best; if
so, they will become symbols, not of inclusion but of incompetence. The
Service should cease to be invertebrate in the face of this politically
motivated interference.13
Diversity has of course highlighted sexual habits.
Sexual Habits
When I joined the Diplomatic Service, I had been thoroughly vetted (the
procedure was called “positive vetting”), to ensure that I was not a
member of, or connected to, extreme political parties such as the
Communist Party of Great Britain; that I was not an alcoholic and/or a
drug-taker; that I was not a compulsive gambler; and that I was not a
homosexual. Certain retired chaps from the armed forces interviewed me
and even took a friend of mine out to lunch to ask about my habits. As it
happened, I was none of the above, and was therefore offered my post. I
could not be blackmailed. Naturally, the odd homosexual slipped through
the net, and not only types such as the infamous Burgess and Maclean. I
know of a contemporary colleague who was homosexual. But sometimes
they were found out. For example, one chap was seen kissing a male
friend at a party, and was asked to resign. Imagine my surprise, when I
was posted to an Embassy as Third Secretary in Chancery (political), to
discover that a locally engaged British member of the embassy was an
open homosexual. (Just before I left my post, he told me that he had had
sexual relations with a senior diplomat at our embassy). Of course, I soon
realised that “when in Rome, do as the Romans do”, or at least do not
criticise local ways of living. And this European city was certainly very
open about homosexuality. The head of a large department of the Foreign
Ministry, with whom I had occasional professional dealings, was even
Secretary of the city’s “Gay Association”. This was in the late seventies,
over ten years after the legalisation of homosexuality in Britain. It was
under the John Major premiership that homosexuals were eventually
allowed into the Diplomatic Service. And they were encouraged to declare
their preferences. The stigma was removed, and they could no longer be
blackmailed for being homosexual, unless, of course, they wished to hide
their habits.
Under Blair, with his “cool Britannia”, and emphasis on “diversity”
(another word so overused as to lose meaning), much publicity was given

to homosexuality. At a Notting Hill Carnival, an FCO staff association
even had a recruitment stand for homosexuals. Some ambassadors
trumpeted their homosexual partnerships in the media, while others put up
Rainbow flags outside their embassies.
Curiously, from being a conservative and traditional organisation, the
Diplomatic Service had suddenly – perhaps, strangely, too suddenly –
gone the other way. Many homosexuals must have been embarrassed by
the attention forced upon them by the politically correct and vociferous
minority. After all, just as I do not go around flaunting my heterosexuality,
nor do many homosexuals flaunt their homosexuality, or bisexuality, as
the case may be.
I cannot therefore but empathise with the thoughts in Andrew Green’s
despatch above. Stressing “diversity” to the point of using sexual habits as
an example of a non-discriminatory society simply reflects warped
thinking. The sole criterion for any job should be ability. In this
connexion, therefore, “positive discrimination” is itself stupid, since it
actually creates apartheid among different groups of people by
emphasising their differences. On top of that, by singling them out for
particular attention, it insults them by implying that they need to be given
a positive discrimination handicap, to do as well as “majority groups”. My
own view is simple: live and let live. But this does not appear to be the
case. Rather, there seems to be an obsession with sex.
Lest any reader think or feel that I am digressing slightly from my
main theme of how the erosion of Standard English and of precise
meaning is part and parcel of Britain’s losing its independence, please
think again about how the vocabulary of political correctness is linked to
the very kind of language which we have been decrying thus far. Let us
now turn to Eric Arthur Blair, aka George Orwell, since he straddles the
whole question of language, particularly political language, like a
colossus, transcending, if not time, then at least our era.
The Orwellian Connexion:
Insincerity the Enemy of Clarity
The timeless 1984 and his other books and short stories apart, George
Orwell has contributed enormously to the quest for good, clear English, to
the extent that he demonstrated, consciously or otherwise, that verbosity
and imprecision are dangerous weapons in the hands of those who seek
totalitarianism. Language, or rather its use and/or abuse, is the key to
“control freakism” (yes, I accept this modern phrase), both as used
cynically (propaganda) or unconsciously (stupidity).
Chapter Three
36
In 1946, he wrote an essay, Politics and the English Language14
, which
is still eminently valid for today. It undoubtedly influenced the wordsmiths
of the Diplomatic Service. Whether it still does is quite another question,
as we have already witnessed above. Let us quote and extract a few gems:
i) Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are
used to seeing in print.
ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do.
iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
iv) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you
can think of an everyday English equivalent.
v) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
To understand the clear connexion between language and thinking, let us
recall the following from the FCO drafting course in Chapter Two:
“Improving our drafting improves our thinking, and improving our
thinking improves our drafting: no one can tell which comes first.” Orwell
writes: “But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt
thought.”
It is thus clear that there is an inherent connexion between clear writing
and clear thinking. The only debate is which comes before the other, in
other words the chicken-egg conundrum. If we are sensible about it, we
could say that whichever does precede the other, they can both enhance
each other. In today’s social and working environment, which has affected
the FCO with unfortunate results, people no longer sit down and
concentrate on good written communication, as they used to. We have
seen above how Matthew Rycroft uses his train journeys to “work on his
Restricted blackberry which is synched to his desktop and laptop”. One is
apt to wonder how serious his rôle can be if he does not have the space to
read a book or newspaper on the train, as was once the habit of
commuters. In other words, are his intellectual space and capacity to
concentrate and apply himself diligently, engaged in a losing battle with
electronic speed, false deadlines, ambition and unconscious political
correctness? Let us quote Orwell:
When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating
the familiar phrases – bestial atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny,

free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder – one often has a
curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind
of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger when the light
catches the speaker’s spectacles and turns them into blank discs which
seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A
speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance towards
turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of
his larynx, but his brain is not involved as it would be if he were choosing
his words for himself. If the speech that he is making is one that he is
accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of
what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church.15
.
And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate
favourable to political conformity.
The above can obviously apply to written speech, as in Matthew Rycroft’s
interview above, and in the FCO’s Stakeholder Engagement staff booklet.
Orwell also pointed to various ingredients of the disease of sloppiness:
using metaphors without properly understanding their meaning – as a
substitute for original thought; substituting simple verbs with phrases,
simply to sound more impressive – “make contact with” instead of
“contact” or “meet”; and pretentiousness, such as padding through the
otiose use of words such as “epoch-making”, “epic”, age-old”, “historic”
and “veritable”.
Pomposity and Superfluity
Pomposity and superfluity, which often aid and abet each other, seem to
have accompanied the onward rush of our new diplomatic excellence.
After all, if English is spoken all over the world then, surely, English
diplomacy must reign supreme, serving as an example to lesser languages
and countries.
This “pompo-superfluity” is of course often unconscious, coming out
of mouths or typing fingers automatically. Let us look at some examples:
“They will have to work with unusually distant time-horizons” really
means “They will have to look far ahead”, while “making precipitate
judgments on the basis of temporary reactions” means “jumping to
conclusions”. As regards simple automaticity of unthinking expression,

While I accept that there may be many who recite and respond mechanically in
church, as the lady in Betjeman’s celebrated poem ‘In Westminster Cathedral’
probably did, since her mind was on her luncheon date, I know that many Christians
do understand and mean what they respond to in church, however repetitive.

Greek students of New York College shortly before the illegal attack on
Iraq in 2002, he said: “We the forces of good”, referring to the US, Britain
and their allies. Many of the students felt quite insulted by what they
considered to be patronising and propagandistic behaviour, unbecoming of
an ambassador. The American ambassador to Greece at about the same
time, Miller, was even more bizarre: when asked about his views on
Greek-Turkish negotiations and Cyprus, he spoke of a “constant, ongoing
process”,16
thus using a triple or, arguably, quadruple tautology. Not
satisfied with this, he later told students at their degree ceremony: “Your
future is your future”.17
Jargon
We cannot end this chapter without a quote from The Economist about
jargon. Even though the article is a quarter of a century old, it could have
been written today.
What ails English? Nothing that has not always ailed it: pomposity, self-
importance, sloppiness of thought and straightforward dishonesty, none of
which is a new vice. It is tempting to think that modern man abuses English
more than his predecessors. Just think of the outpouring of euphemisms:
intimate apparel (underwear), corporate downsizing (cutting staff), make
redundant (sack), physically challenged (assaulted), hearing impaired
(deaf or partially deaf). Think of all those careless expressions: a heart
condition (bad heart)[…]Think of all those expressions that are used to
mean exactly the opposite of what they imply: industrial action (industrial
inaction), shopping centres (always on the outskirts of town), substantially
finished articles (unfinished ones), in my humble opinion (in my self-
satisfied opinion) […] Doesn’t the language of businessmen and
consultants – full of strategic human resource management involving the
evaluation of corporate personnel functions – suffer from bulimia? […]
Isn’t inflation as much a threat to the language as it is to the currency?

It seems that being straight is definitely not de rigueur. The latest
absurdity is the World Bank’s description of prostitution as “transactional
sex”,19
thus somehow treating prostitution as a fairly reasonable thing, just
as “collateral damage” makes murder acceptable to the unthinking masses.
Given what we have seen of some FCO language, it looks as if it was
dragged into verbal confusion et al just a few years after The Economist
article. Thus, far from being the bastion of the English language that it
once was, it seems to have succumbed to thoughtless soundbites and
marketing language. The good old Chief Clerk is now a commuting
Blackberry “Chief Operating Officer”, but one without shareholders to
satisfy, or so one hopes. Let us now move to the nub of the book. We shall
reproduce the 1980 Annual Review for Greece, and then follow it with
those for 2005 and 2006, commenting along the way. The first was written
by the ambassador to Athens, Sutherland, to the then Foreign Secretary,
Lord Carrington. We cannot be certain that he wrote it all, but he did sign
it. (I once wrote a diplomatic despatch on Dutch education, which was sent
and signed by the ambassador). I shall insert my comments/corrections in
square brackets.

THEN AND TODAY
A little learning is a dang’rous thing.
In this chapter, we shall reproduce three annual reviews, for 1980, 2005,
2006 respectively, and a letter written in the same language as an annual
review or dispatch, for 1981, and then pinpoint various differences in their
style and content.
GREECE: ANNUAL REVIEW FOR 1980
SUMMARY
Hellenism in retreat as Greece identifies with Western Europe
(paragraph 1).
2. Karamanlis President. Rallis a surprise but sensible choice to
succeed him as Prime Minister. His image as New Democracy
faces the challenges of an election year (paragraph 2).
3. Papandreou sought to appear more moderate. The Centre in
disarray. No serious challenge to the Government from the
Right (paragraphs 3-5).
4. An end to six years of unsatisfactory semi-membership of
NATO. Perceptible improvement in Greek-Turkish relations
(paragraphs 6-8).
5. Greek-Soviet relations static, but little affected by international
developments including Afghanistan. Greece cultivated by her
Balkan neighbours (paragraph 9).
Chapter Four
42
6. Greece joins the European Community with firm political
commitment but inadequate preparation (paragraphs 10 and
11).
7. Not a good year for the economy, but better than forecast
(paragraphs 12 and 13).
8. Strong pound reduced competitiveness of British exports. A
major contract lost, but something gained in the public sector.
An active year with many visitors including the Prime Minister
and 750,000 British tourists. Relations with the Tenth Member
generally in good shape.
My Lord,
In all the years since independence the Greeks have never
quite known where they stood in relation to Europe. They have had
a problem of identity. 1980 may well be regarded in the future as a
crucial year in that long search for definition in their relationship
with the West; and also for the West’s perception of this relatively
small and still, in European terms, relatively under-developed
country, so often clouded by visions of its historic past. The Greeks,
who are incorrigible romantics and subtle propagandists, will no
doubt continue to promote the concept of a special Hellenic
destiny. The Government’s principal achievements of the past year,
accession to the European Communities and full membership of
NATO, could be undermined by the result of the 1981 General
Elections. But, whatever happens then, these aspirations will
become increasingly difficult to sustain as Greece becomes, for
better or worse, more closely linked to and more like other Western
European states.
Internal politics and prospects
2. The question everyone was asking in the opening months of
1980 was what would Karamanlis do when President Tsatsos
reached the end of his term in May. Would the 73-year old
statesman who had first been Prime Minister as long ago as 1955
retire, or would he stay on to lead the party he had founded in 1974
into another election? In the event, he calculated that he could best
serve both the interest of New Democracy and his own ambition by
Then and Today

43
standing for the Presidency. The subsequent election of George
Rallis as the new leader by the Parliamentary members of the party
was not generally expected. But in retrospect he seems a sensible,
even the obvious choice. Had Averoff, the candidate of the Right,
defeated by only four votes, become leader and Prime Minister, he
would have found it much more difficult to hold New Democracy
together and to compete with Papandreou for the votes of the
Centre. Rallis is not an inspiring leader but he has set about
improving party organisation in a methodical way and has
succeeded in retaining the loyalty both of Averoff and of the former
liberals in the previous Government, including Mitsotakis whom he
moved to the Foreign Ministry, and Kanellopoulos, the eccentric
Minister of Agriculture. If, as he is now saying, Rallis delays
elections until the autumn he will have over a year to emerge from
under the shadow of his illustrious predecessor and establish a
separate image. Karamanlis will continue to prompt him from the
wings, but paradoxically his reassuring presence in the Presidency
may cause some to think that they can safely vote for change. It is
too soon to make predictions and judgment is particularly difficult
with the volatile Greek electorate but, despite the economic
situation, the ruling party does not appear to have lost further
support and may indeed have gained a little in the concluding
weeks of 1980. Assisted by events in Turkey and Poland, Rallis can
point to more than one success in foreign policy. Belatedly, a
campaign has been launched to advertise the benefits of
Community membership. He has too had some success in selling
the virtues of what he calls the “mild political climate”. Not an
exciting slogan, but calculated to suggest a policy of moderation,
continuity and common sense.
3. Papandreou also sought to appear more moderate and more
statesmanlike. He too courts the Centre. Early in the year, he had
moved from outright rejection of the Community to advocating a
special relationship for Greece. Since May, he has been saying
resignedly that so long as Karamanlis is President, PASOK’s
declared policy of putting membership to the test of a referendum
will be blocked. There is less talk of withdrawal or of boycott.
PASOK would work from within to better the terms of accession.
Even on NATO, against which there is more popular feeling than
against the Community, Papandreou now suggests, as he did when
you saw him in London in November, that he would not necessarily
Chapter Four
44
wish to take Greece out of the Alliance. These shifts in the direction
of moderation disturb the more dogmatic Left-wingers in the Party
Central Committee. They also probably gave encouragement to the
pro-Moscow Communists who, Afghanistan and Poland
notwithstanding, may increase their 12 per cent of the popular
vote. The KK(E) will not, I believe, enter into any electoral alliance
or join any coalition. But a spectre which alarms those who predict
a hung election is that the Communists might hold the balance in
the next parliament.
4. George Mavros, one-time Foreign Minister with leanings
towards PASOK, formed a new Centre Rally Party. But few have
rallied and the politicians of the Centre are still in disarray. On the
Right, the return to active politics of Markezinis, whose astute
economic advice sustained the dictatorship, has not created any
serious challenge to New Democracy, as anticipated by some who
backed Averoff for the leadership.
5. One of the achievements of the Karamanlis years since 1974
had been that violence, once regarded as endemic to the Greek
political scene, was scarcely evident. 1980 saw a police chief shot,
serious clashes on the 7th
Anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising,
a series of minor bombings and, in December, the burning down of
two of Athens’ main department stores by unidentified but
politically motivated activists. These were ominous portents. But
Greece has been and still is unaffected by the kind of terrorism
which has blighted Italy and Spain.
Foreign policy: NATO, Turkey and the US bases
6. At the beginning of the year, entry to the Community had
already been assured. But few would have predicted that the
Government’s other main objective, reintegration into the military
structure of NATO, would also be attained. The new SACEUR,
General Rogers, quickly won the confidence of the Greeks to an
extent never enjoyed by General Haig. It is true that the settlement
reached in October left the most delicate issues affecting command
boundaries open for further negotiation; and not only the
Opposition protested that the Turkish troops, whose action had
precipitated withdrawal, were still in Cyprus. But the psychological
effect of an end to six years of unsatisfactory semi-membership was
great. In the event, the Government was able, without undue
Then and Today

45
difficulty, to present the terms to Parliament as satisfactorily
preserving the national interest vis-à-vis both the Alliance and
Turkey.
7. The year also saw a perceptible improvement in the climate of
Greek-Turkish relations. The lifting of NOTAM 714 at the end of
January which permitted the resumption of direct air services was
a harbinger of what later emerged as a shift of policy in Ankara,
reflecting the increased influence of the Turkish military. With the
experience of the Colonels, the Greeks could scarcely welcome the
military régime, but at last there were leaders in Ankara prepared
to take decisions and, up to a point, to talk substance. 1981 opened
on a note of optimism over prospects for the bilateral talks on
Aegean issues and even Cyprus. What remains to be seen is
whether the Greek and Turkish Governments, the former with an
eye on the forthcoming elections, can muster the statesmanship to
take advantage of the possibilities for progress.
8. The negotiation of a new agreement on the US bases had to
wait for both the conclusion of the corresponding agreement with
Turkey and NATO reintegration. Drafts have been exchanged. With
the Greeks insisting on an explicit recognition of a 7:10 ratio for
military aid to Greece and Turkey, a timetable which aims at
ratification in March seems unrealistic. But I do not think that
either Rallis or the Americans will allow the negotiations to be
overtaken by the elections.
Foreign policy: Other dimensions
9. In my Annual Review for 1979 I noted that the Greeks, having
belatedly discovered détente, found it difficult to go into reverse
after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. A certain ambivalence
also characterized their attitude in 1980. Karamanlis’ proposal,
formally put to the Olympic Committee in February, that the
Games should find a permanent site in Greece, meant that there
was never any prospect of their going along with the Moscow
boycott. There was not much substance to relations with the Soviet
Union but they were little if at all affected by international
developments. The Balkan neighbours came in for a great deal of
attention. Impatient at having less to do in the Presidency,
Karamanlis paid State Visits in the autumn to Romania, Bulgaria
and Yugoslavia. In Sofia, Zhivkov displayed a new-found interest in
Chapter Four
46
Balkan co-operation, at least on economic topics. There has been
talk of Greek/Bulgarian reconciliation, although the Nestos waters
dispute remains unresolved.
The European Community
10. When, last of the Nine, the Netherlands ratified the Treaty of
Accession on 10 June, 1980, the way was clear for Greece to
become, formally, the Tenth Member. It has been 19 years since
Karamanlis, even then looking ahead to membership, had signed
the treaty of Association and six since he initiated the negotiations
for accession. Throughout, he and the Greek Government have
been primarily motivated by political considerations which will
continue to influence their attitude within the Community. They see
the Community as a bulwark against their political enemies to the
North and East and a guarantee of democracy at home. This is
what Karamanlis meant when he said in his New Year Presidential
address that Greece need no longer look for protectors and
guardians. They may well be disappointed in their expectations.
They also want a strong and united Community. Herr Genscher’s
recently revived ideas for a United Europe find an echo in Athens.
11. Throughout the year preparations for participation in the
Community continued. As observers, the Greeks were early
inducted into political co-operation. But as Accession day
approached it became evident that in various practical matters
preparations were not complete. It was not until December, for
instance, that a Bill was rushed through Parliament on the
interdepartmental responsibility for Community policies. There is
still a demarcation dispute between the Ministries of Co-ordination
and Foreign Affairs. The Greeks do not lack talent but, as Ministers
and officials participate in their first meetings in Brussels, this
talent is imperfectly focused and as yet no proper machinery has
been devised for the formulation of long-term strategy. More
seriously, little has been done in some sectors, particularly
banking, to prepare the economy for the process of adaptation.
The Economy
12. It was not a good year for the Greek economy but not as bad
as forecast. Inflation remains at the high level of about 26 per cent;
but at least it has not gone up. The 1981 budget is mildly
inflationary, but the Minister of Finance forecasts a reduction to 20
Then and Today

47
per cent. Rallis returned from the Luxembourg Summit to deliver a
stern homily on wage restraint. However, in an election year, with
further increases due in the price of foodstuffs as adjustments are
made to Community levels, he will be reluctant to court
unpopularity with stern measures. The Government had little
success in deflecting investment from the unproductive housing
sector and private industrial investment has been virtually at a
standstill. But unemployment has generally been maintained and
the end-of-year figures recorded some growth – if only by 1.6 per
cent.
13. The high price of oil and, after the Iran/Iraq war, problems of
oil supply continued to be a cause for concern to everyone
responsible for the economic policies of a country so heavily
dependent upon imported sources of energy. But, partly because of
the controls on imports, partly because of the general slowdown in
economic activity, and partly through a modest increase in exports,
the deficit on visible trade was not as horrendous as expected. With
receipts from shipping and tourism both substantially up, the
invisibles sector was buoyant – not enough to fill the trade gap, but
sufficient to reduce the current account deficit to a manageable $2
billion, marginally less than in 1979.
Anglo-Greek relations
14. That special relationship with Britain of which many Greeks
speak wistfully has been given more substance. Soon after my
arrival in Athens I had recommended that British
Parliamentarians, exporters and Ministers should display a more
conspicuous interest. Since the return of democracy in 1974 our
competitors, particularly the French, had been consolidating
positions of advantage. I could not complain of neglect in 1980. A
delegation of captains of industry from the London Chamber; the
Governor of the Bank of England for a successful conference on
invisibles which count for more proportionately to Britain and
Greece than any other Community country; Mr. Harold Macmillan
to receive a prize for saving the Acropolis, recalling the days when
Greece looked first to Britain for protection against Fascism and
against Communism; the Anglo-Greek Parliamentary Group on a
visit which this time was more than tourism. British shipping
interests were out in force for the biannual Posidonia Exhibition
and arms salesmen the first Greek defence equipment show. The
Chapter Four
48
Prime Minister came in September, Mr. Nott in October and in
November Mr. Walker with a businesslike mission from the
Agricultural Export Council. They scrutinized and encouraged
their future Community colleagues and urged them to buy British.
15. To what result? The over-valued pound and import controls
(only withdrawn just prior to accession) meant that exports
remained at about the same level as in 1979. Hopes that the
Memorandum of Understanding on economic co-operation signed
in November 1979 would lead to major negotiated contracts in the
public sector were frustrated when our package offer for a coal-
fired power station was turned down by the Greek Prime Minister
just before Christmas. The failure to bring off what would have
been the largest ever won by Britain in Greece was a set-back. But
British consultants have done well. Some sizeable contracts have
been secured. One, for a petrochemical plant, is the largest
awarded for many years. It is acknowledged that we have not had
our due share in the public sector or in defence procurement.
However – and accession sees the end of concessionary export
credits - neither sentiment nor political persuasion will sell goods
which are uncompetitive in price.
16. The strong pound, the weak drachma and the exceptionally
long summer brought more people from Britain than ever before to
the increasingly polluted beaches and to tramp the monuments of
Greece’s past glory – 750,000 visitors, more than from any other
country. There were still more Greek students in Britain than from
anywhere else in Europe, but the decision not to apply the
concessionary Community fees until nine months after accession
caused some of the better potential applicants to turn to the US and
elsewhere. This is a pity. The long-standing educational connection
with the UK is worth fostering.
17. It was also a pity (the transitional period notwithstanding)
that no way could be devised to allow Greeks arriving at Heathrow
after 1 January to enter through the “Community” channel. But
with no major bilateral issues dividing us, relations are generally
in good shape as Greece enters Europe.
18. I am sending copies of this dispatch to Her Majesty’s
Representatives at Ankara, Nicosia, Moscow, Washington, and all

Representatives to the European Communities and NATO.

Twenty five years later, the Annual Review was different, to the extent
that some would not consider it a review. The FCO sent it to me with
several redactions, but not enough to seriously mar trying to understand it.
It was presumably signed by the ambassador. Readers are welcome to
speculate on what has been redacted.
Greece Annual Review 2005
Summary
A year of patchy progress on the economy. Some structural reforms
– but not enough. A mixed picture on regional issues but Greece
was helpful over EU/Turkey in the approach to 3 October.
Detail
1. Reading the Greek press last week would have given the
reader a flavour of events in 2005. The Government
introduced a bill on reform (but not privatisation) of state-
owned enterprises. A two-day strike brought Athens traffic
to a halt but as a gesture of protest rather than in
expectation that the Government would pay any attention
– which it didn’t. A new poll showed Karamanlis’ centre-
right New Democracy party holding a narrow and
unenthusiastic mid-term lead – and rumours that under-
performing Ministers would be reshuffled drifted into the
media for the umpteenth time. A public official was sacked
for corruption. A bomb (later claimed by an anarcho-
terrorist group) went off in downtown Athens. [a short
sentence redacted]

2. For Greece this has been a patchy year. The Government
was elected 20 months ago on a platform of bold economic
and social reform. But in the face of union resistance and
the public’s aversion to social disharmony, Karamanlis
has settled on a policy of ‘gradual adjustment’. This has
meant action aiming to reduce Greece’s excessive public
deficit from 6.6% in the Olympics year to 2.6% in 2007 –
but emphasising low pain measures such as better tax
collection. There is some progress but the ambitious target
will be missed. Poor Greeks are increasingly feeling the
pinch.
3. More importantly for the long-term, the Government has
not done enough this year to dismantle state participation
and interference in the economy – no surprise that Greece
is among the least competitive of EU economies. To its
credit the Government has passed some reforming
legislation eg on energy liberalisation, PPP and working
hours. But modest reforms have seemed to need
disproportionate political energy. [five lines redacted]
4. But it’s not all bad news. Economic growth (3.5%) is
buoyant thanks to domestic consumption, tourism and
shipping (a hugely prosperous year for a country that
owns 20% of the world fleet). A large grey economy means
that 10% unemployment is less painful than it might be.
EU funds keep rolling in, to the visible benefit of the
country. And in Greece money isn’t everything – family
and community ties are strong. Public drunkenness is
rare; Athens is among the safest cities in Europe.
5. Next year promises more of the same. Karamanlis will do
enough in the way of reform so that he can claim the
credentials of a moderniser but without scaring the voters.
Indeed with municipal elections next year and
parliamentary elections due in 2008, he will be tempted to
loosen the pursestrings. Fortunately for him, the PASOK
opposition is in deep disarray: [a line and a half redacted].
We should expect Karamanlis to be reelected in 2008.
6. Greece doesn’t really have a foreign policy to comment on
– it has a regional policy with an international dimension.
Again, caution has been the main characteristic. On
Turkey the Government delivered on its commitment to
support Turkish EU aspirations and was helpful in the
Then and Today

51
approach to 3 October (good) but failed to convince the
Greek public that it had anything to show for it (bad). On
Cyprus it tried to coax Papadopoulos in the right direction
(good) [another line redacted]. On the EU, Greece
represented Old Europe (big budget, more integration,
preserve the CAP, abolish the WTD opt-out) (bad) but was
characteristically marginal to most of the arguments
(good). [another line redacted]. Incidentally, if Molyviatis
steps down and his place is taken by Dora Bakoyianni, the
Mayor of Athens, we should expect a far more assertive
Greek policy, including with Cyprus and Turkey (good and
bad).
7. We have important interests to pursue here:
x SP1. Greece still doesn’t see Islamic terrorism as
a major threat, but that has not stopped good
operational cooperation when needed. Its post-
Colonels attachment to civil liberties can make
Greece hesitant over EU CT measures (eg data
retention) but we have been able to take them
with us through careful lobbying and explanation.
[nearly two lines redacted]. The murder of a
guard outside our Military Attache’s house a
year ago remains unsolved.
x SP2. We have raised our game on illegal
immigration his year. Greece is a significant
transit route for illegal immigrants from Turkey
and North Africa, and many end up at Dover. [a
further two lines redacted]. We are also working
with Ankara to encourage less dysfunctional
Greek/Turkish cooperation on illegal
immigration.
x SP3. Turkey and Cyprus are the key issues, of
course. Greece has two cardinal principles. One
is to support Turkish EU membership. The other
is not to be divided from Cyprus on an issue of
importance. This poses obvious strains. We
continue to work privately and through the media
to keep Greece focused on the strategic prize of a
democratic and European Turkey. This is a real
task: 79% of Greeks oppose Turkish EU
membership. [two more lines redacted]. Our
Chapter Four
52
suggestion of a declaration that any progress
towards EU membership would have to be under
the name Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia was implemented at the European
Council [a line and a half redacted].
x SP4. See above. Much of our EU work involves
public presentation and reporting rather than
changing minds. But after heavy lobbying we did
see signs of Greek flexibility over WTD at the last
EPSCO. We should try to capture this shift
through an Alan Johnson letter to the Greek
Employment Minister.
x SP5. Greece is the UK’s 28th largest export
market. Our (reduced) commercial section have
received plaudits for their work this year. PPP.
Ports and Healthcare are areas of particular
interest [another four lines redacted].
x Consular/Entry Clearance. We get about 3
million tourists to Greece every year. This
typically brings with it about 140 deaths, 50
rapes (a particular problem) and 190 arrests. Not
to mention a slew of agonizing cases involving
psychiatric problems, minors etc. I am full of
admiration for the kindness and efficiency with
which our consular staff throughout Greece cope.
x Efficiency. In the last year we have given up from
our core FCO resources [one line redacted]. This
is a big hit and leaves us a small core resource.
But the Embassy works better and more happily
for the consequent delayering.
Comment
The 1980 review, over twice as long as the 2005 one, has a useful
summary which gives a precise idea of the detail, including in which
paragraph to find it, unlike the 2005 one, the summary of which is only
marginally useful. The 1980 review reads more like a reasoned, evaluated
and informative tract, not overly formal, but certainly not chatty, like the
2005 one, which even uses “didn’t”, “it’s” and “doesn’t”, something
which would have been out of the question in the Eighties. Moreover, the
use of the first person plural throughout adds to the chattiness. The review
Then and Today

53
also lacks headings, unlike the 1980 one. And it assumes that the reader is
meant to understand that various actions of the Greek government are
either good or bad. It does not say why, but simply puts the words “good”
and “bad” in brackets after various sentences. Only someone in the FCO
who was very well acquainted with Greece would be able to latch on to
some of what is written, without having to research, and know why it was
good or bad from the official British standpoint. Despite being over half
the length of its “father”, the review manages to confuse the reader with
the sentence “I am full of admiration for the kindness and efficiency with
which our consular staff throughout Greece cope”. One needs to read it at
least twice before one realises that the writer meant: “I admire the consular
staff’s kindness and efficiency in coping”, rather than that his staff had to
cope with their kindness and efficiency! Similarly, the sentence “On the
EU, Greece represented Old Europe….but was characteristically marginal
to most of the arguments.” is ambivalent. It presumably means that Greece
had little influence in arguing, but we cannot be sure. As for the sentence
“This is a big hit and leaves us a small core resource.”, at first I thought of
a music hit, until I realised that the writer meant “a big blow”. An obvious
error comes with “Our (reduced) commercial section have [...]”. It should
be “has”, as the writer would have seen if he had checked his review
thoroughly enough. As for the phrase “downtown Athens”, this is
definitely an American import, when “central Athens” would be
preferable. Finally, the word “delayering” makes the reader pause
momentarily, until he realises that “reduction in staff” is probably what is
meant.
While I have managed to find several quibbles with the 2005 review, it
is trickier to do so with the 1980 one, where my quibbles are small: I
would, for example, use “attracted a great deal of attention”, instead of
came in for (para.9), and before rather than prior to (para 15). The 1981
review also has a hint of humour at one point, when the ambassador
writes: “[…] a new Centre Rally Party. But few have rallied.” Let us now
look at the 2006 review.
Greece Annual Review 2006
Summary
1. A good year for Greece. Strong economic performance.
Elections likely in mid-2007 – Karamanlis is favourite to win
again. What is the embassy delivering?
Chapter Four
54
Detail
2. 2006 was a good year for Greece. The economy is doing well. It
is among the fastest-growing Euro zone economies (4.4% in Q3).
The deficit has been trimmed from an awful 6.8% in 2004 to a
creditable 2.8% in 2006 (and not all by smoke and mirrors). And
unemployment, although high, has fallen from 11% to 8.3%.
Tourism is up, shipping is still booming, Greek banks and other
businesses are making big inroads into the Balkans.
3. Against that background Prime Minister Karamanlis will
probably go to the polls in mid 2007 (he could hang on until March
2008) and is strong favourite to win. George Papandreou’s PASOK
opposition are still navel gazing now that their prolonged period of
government (21 years between 1981 and 2004) is over.
4. Nevertheless, Greece is a paradox. Despite all the positive
macro-economic news Greece is among the least competitive, least
transparent, least business-friendly and least liberalized economies
in the old EU15. Every act of modernisation in Greece is fought
over by trade unions and other interest groups who want the world
to stay the same. If the European economy turns down and receipts
from the EU start to dry up, Greece’s economy could take a turn
for the worse.
What is the Embassy delivering?
5. We are a platform Embassy, with staff from MOD, SOCA, Home
Office, Metropolitan Police and others as well as the separately
funded Consular/Visa/Commercial services. The core FCO staff is
small. But we achieve harmonious cross-departmental working
partly through a Business Plan which recognizes collective
ownership of everyone’s contribution. Our key objectives this year
are:
Objective 1: CT/Illegal Immigration/Narcotics (SPs 1,2 and 8)
Greece is an important illegal immigration transit route lying close
to the Middle East. SOCA, supported by the FCO, have made good
progress in persuading the Greeks to adopt a more targeted [a few
words redacted] approach to illegal immigration and have also
helped bridge [word redacted] gaps [several words redacted]. The
practical result has been the arrest of targeted individuals involved
in illegal immigration. A good example of collaborative working.
There is also a residual local terrorism threat exemplified by a not
very effective assassination attempt earlier this year on the former
Public Order Minister. Nevertheless, CT cooperation with Greece
Then and Today

55
is workmanlike rather than enthusiastic: terrorism – internal or
external – is not yet seen by the Greeks as a priority.
Objective 2: Regional Stability – Cyprus, Turkey and Western
Balkans (SP 3) [eight whole lines, the whole section, redacted]
Objective 3: Advancing UK Interests on the EU/Economic
Agenda (SPs 4, 5 and 6)
On most EU subjects we and Greece are at opposite ends of the
spectrum. They support more integration, a bigger budget, rigid
social legislation and lax implementation of EU rules eg on
competition. Lobbying and briefing does sometimes deliver small
but worthwhile results. But I’m not convinced we should devote
much resource to EU lobbying except in swing vote countries.
There is a wider agenda where we can make a difference. Greece is
an increasingly important energy transit country that is trying to
diversify supply despite Russian pressure on gas. [line and a half
redacted] We are trying to develop messages on CAP reform which
have resonance in a country like Greece as well as encouraging
pro-reform voices in Greece to speak out. As part of our strategy
we held a UK/Greece seminar on agricultural reform. Structured
feedback showed that it positively influenced the views of
participants. Climate change has not made the leap yet on to the
political agenda in Greece: we are trying to help it along by
encouraging the NGO sector to work together to build a stronger
voice.
Objective 4: Advancing UK Commercial Interests (SP5)
We are beginning to see the fruits of the effort we have devoted in
the last couple of years to building up Britain’s reputation for
Public Private Partnership – several British companies have
picked up initial contracts using some of the contacts we have
cultivated. And we are almost at the last stage of Government
approval for a £1 billion tourism investment in Crete to which we
have committed a great deal of lobbying effort (which the company
recognise has been critical to their success so far).
Objective 5: Defence Procurement (SP 5)
[The whole five-line paragraph has been redacted]
Objective 6: Strengthening Deployable Greek Military Capability
(SP 3).
In the last couple of years the Greeks have raised somewhat their
contribution to NATO (and EU) operations. [one line redacted]
With others, we need to keep pushing them to do more. But it is
Chapter Four
56
frustrating that, for now, the Greek Government is determined to
do the respectable minimum.
Objective 7 (Consular/Entry Clearance (SP 8 and 9)
Consular work is one of the most important things we do. This
summer our staff dealt with the fires in the tourist area of
Halkidiki; the tragic carbon monoxide poisoning of a family on
Corfu; two cases in which Britons were either pushed or jumped
from balconies (in one case holding two children) and a host of
tourist consular problems. [four lines redacted] Like in many posts,
our staff do all of that – professionally and cheerfully.
Objective 8: Effective Management
No year is easy these days. We had a disruptive rewire of the
Embassy and the latest round of UKTI savings resulting in the loss
of our excellent LE2 Consul in Thessaloniki has added to staff
anxiety about the future. Staff reductions in Europe are inevitable
and logical – our FCO core has shrunk over the last two years and
there is more to come. I simply observe that salami slicing takes its
toll on local staff morale.
Objective 9: Public Diplomacy
It is never too difficult to win space in the Greek media – and we do
a lot of it. On foreign policy this is damage limitation. Years ago in
Greece if you were pro-Turkish you had to be anti-Greek. This has
changed. Now if you are pro-Turkish you must be anti-Greek-
Cypriot. Better, but still not great for us. I sometimes find that you
achieve more by talking publicly about sport or Europe than you do
by tackling head-on issues on which your audience have already
made their mind up.
Comment
The review for 2006 is riddled with oddities, and is virtually in note form.
In the apparent two-line summary, we are again treated to the word
“delivering”, while in paragraph 5, the ambassador’s readership at home is
reminded that “we are a platform embassy”, and that “we achieve
harmonious cross-departmental working partly through a Business Plan
which recognises collective ownership of everyone’s contribution.” What
the ambassador probably means is that the embassy personnel work well
together. In Objective 3, “Lobbying and briefing does sometimes deliver
etc”, when it should read “do”; while “we should devote much resource to
EU lobbying”, should read “many/more resources”, or better, simply
“lobby so much”. In Objective 4, “recognise” should be “recognises”.
Then and Today

57
Following the verbless statement “Better, but still not great for us.”, the
final sentence of the review has two basic grammatical errors: “your
audience have already made their mind up”, when it should obviously read
“has” and “its”.
Simon Gass was the ambassador. He joined the Diplomatic Service in
1977, working in United Nations Department, and was, I remember, a
stickler for efficient writing. Yet somehow, by the time he became
ambassador in Athens, he had succumbed to the chatty, Blairite feely-
touchy “cool Britannia” politically correct culture. Thus, he is an example
of the many well-educated diplomats who have been drenched – perhaps
subliminally – in a new fashion of chatty written language, often in note
form, not properly checked, and therefore containing some basic errors,
written quickly on a computer, and e-mailed back home. I went to see him
at his residence in 2005 to renew our old acquaintanceship and to give him
a copy of a book that I had written on Cyprus. We spent almost an hour
together, and apart from telling me that he enjoyed playing the steel-string
guitar, he asked for my views on Cyprus. When I gave him my ideas, his
immediate reaction was: “I wonder what the Americans would think”. As I
left, he said: “You must come to dinner”. I expect that he then read my
book and discovered that I had written somewhere that Britain had
succumbed to US foreign policy objectives. I am still awaiting his kind
invitation.
To try and be a little more positive, both the above examples of annual
reviews do at least use English spelling. They are also very succinct, and
therefore of some use to busy readers. But they are virtually devoid of any
serious analysis. One reason for this is that it is no longer easy to “go to
the file”, and really understand the history of a situation. As one recently
retired ambassador said above, “it is all on the hoof”. Somehow,
electronification and tweeting seem to have taken away the space that
diplomats once had for thinking, properly understanding, and thus writing
reasoned and useful reviews. Let us now, to contrast 2006 with 1981,
reproduce most of a letter written by the ambassador to Athens in 1981,
Sutherland, to the Assistant Secretary of State, Fergusson. Apart from its
entertainment value, barely concealed humour in parts, and incisive
evidence of understanding, it could almost count as a despatch.

GREEK POLITICS: THE STATE OF PLAY
1. The question raised in paragraph 2 of your letter of 12
December has led us to some reflection on the nature of
Greek political parties and the Greek electorate, and the
possibility of reform.
2. Your question was whether the old political establishment
represented by New Democracy has grown irretrievably
inefficient and corrupt to the point where a New
Democracy administration is incapable of carrying out
the sort of reform necessary to enable Greece to compete
economically or evolve politically. You went on to ask
whether enough people might accept this thesis for
Papandreou in his guise of pragmatic reformer to prove
an election winner. My answer to the first question is a
qualified no. But I should like to examine the terms of the
question.
3. First, inefficiency and corruption. The Greek public
service is bureaucratic, slow moving, and highly
politicised. The administration finds it difficult to respond
to the need for reform (which is in many areas widely
recognised by the press, by officials and by Ministers) in a
consistent and determined way without being blown off
course. Though the Greeks are good at making plans, they
are less good at carrying them out, and pastmasters at
changing them for new plans. The city of Athens is a case
in point. It has consistently outgrown the plans of the
Ministers and townplanners until now it poses a series of
exceptionally difficult problems in the field of traffic
control, control of urban growth, provision of sewerage
and other services. It has indeed been Governments of the
Right (New Democracy and its predecessor ERE, plus of
course the junta for whose actions the old political
establishment cannot be held responsible) which failed to
keep up with this growing bundle of problems. Apologists
say that the initial cause of the problem was the influx of
so many refugees from the countryside as a result of the
civil war and changes since in agriculture; nevertheless
Then and Today

59
there was a failure to grapple with consequences that
could have been predicted.
4. Where the administration and the citizen come face to fact
there is also inefficient and sometimes inhumane
bureaucracy. Diplomats are insulated from much of this,
but the foreigner gets the flavour of it when, for example,
he goes to collect a parcel from the parcels office, or
deals with Customs over an imported car. The problem is
partly an Ottoman bureaucratic tradition which revels in
documentation and in which the petty official, not able to
take responsibility for positive action, shows his power by
obstructing this fellow citizens; partly the effect of the low
level of education of the majority of civil servants,
compounded by the propensity of all governments to put
placemen into the administration (which in turn results in
over-manning). These problems are recognised and
widely bewailed. The conservative newspaper Kathimerini
publishes regular leaders on the deficiencies of the
administration. The Government itself has established a
committee of Ministry General Secretaries under the
Deputy Prime Minister to deal with them. But no one
expects it to produce results this side of the elections. And
it should not be forgotten that the inefficient hierarchical
system which calls for six signatures on a document was
designed to prevent corruption.
5. Much of the ‘corruption’ in Greek public life amounts in
my view to little more than the working to the limits of the
political system, which allows and is indeed based on the
principle of rousfeti, or favours done between patron and
client. This is, as anthropologists can show, deeply
embedded in Greek society, and serves a social purpose
so long as the administration does not provide speedy and
impartial treatment to its citizens. (I am aware there is a
circular argument here in that rousfeti itself prevents the
development of a just state.) The local deputy persuades
the Minister to find a job in a corner of his Ministry for
the son of one of his clients (the Greeks say “one of our
people”). The boy is not too bright and will not improve
the efficiency of the Ministry: but the votes of the client,
Chapter Four
60
who is the village Headman, and of his extended family
and friends, are assured. The same principle of favours
exchanged applies of course to other benefits than jobs –
places in hospital, even attachments to embassies abroad.
6. There have been grosser examples of corruption involving
the highly placed including Ministers. The handling of
public sector contracts can provide examples. But I do not
have the impression that this is widespread. Nor that the
reputation of the government and administration has been
damaged. The Greek voters seem to regard both the lesser
and the greater corruption as an inevitable part of the
political and social scene. With proper scepticism, they do
not (except for the committed and the naïve) expect
PASOK to be much different.
7. In this connection I would add that although there are
extremes of riches and of poverty and by and large there
is a correlation between wealth and voting patterns, there
is a relatively high rate of social and economic mobility
and barriers of class are not pronounced. Moreover
inefficiency and corruption as described above have not
prevented the transformation of Greece, materially, in the
last thirty years. GNP per capita has risen from $582 in
1962 to $1474 in 1979 (at constant 1970 prices). For this
reason I doubt whether they are so endemic or damaging
as to prevent Greece from competing economically.
Accession to the European Community is certainly going
to bring particular, and acute problems of adaptation in
which some parts of Greek industry, unable to compete
without protection, will go under ( I am reporting on this
in a separate dispatch.) It is also the case that the
economic situation at present is bleak (inflation in 1981 is
unlikely to fall below the 1980 figure of 26% to give one
indicator) and this will affect the election campaign. But
in the longer term I do not doubt the Greek capacity to
adapt and compete.
8. Political evolution is another thing. External factors –
civil war, junta, dictatorship – have prevented the
evolution of a solid, smoothly working democratic system
Then and Today

61
since the war. If the test of such a system is the
“alternance” of parties in power, then the experience of
the period 1964-7, when it looked as if the Centre Union
of George Papandreou might take over smoothly from the
conservative ERE, suggests that Greece was not ready or
mature enough. Since 1975 the forms of democracy have
been there and they have been filled with some substance.
Karamanlis has laid the groundwork for an “alternance”
and as I put it in my dispatch of 14 May his best wish for
Greece would be to preside over a society where this can
take place without catastrophic upheavals. Other things
being equal, I would, as I suggested in my dispatch on
PASOK of 12 June, judge that it would be in the interests
of Greece herself (for the consolidation of democratic
institutions) and of New Democracy that the party should
have a spell in opposition and a chance to renew itself.
9. But other things are not equal. The alternative is PASOK.
I have already analysed in the despatch referred to above
why I think that PASOK in power would be a force for
instability and disintegration, damaging to western
interests.
10. You asked whether, given the deficiencies of New
Democracy, Papandreou’s pragmatist guise could prove
an election winner. I am not going to predict election
results. But my guess is those votes that come to
Papandreou from the centre will not be cast in positive
recognition of his “pragmatic” and “moderate” policies,
but faute de mieux by people who cannot bring themselves
to vote for the right and see that a vote for the centre is
wasted. Papandreou is still pretty widely mistrusted
except among committed PASOK supporters, a fact that
New Democracy will play on in the campaign.
11. Finally, where within the system lies the possibility of
change and reform such as will reduce the inefficiencies
and eliminate the corruption? It is hard to see. I have
doubts about PASOK’s credentials to reform the
administration and machinery of government. The
politicisation of the administration will be important to
Chapter Four
62
PASOK’s survival and effectiveness; and there is a built-
in likelihood of further overmanning of regional
administration in PASOK’s proposals for devolution and
the restructuring of local government; also in their
proposals for nationalisation. Nor is it easy to see rapid
change from new Democracy. The years in power have
eroded the will to improve the existing order which was so
evident after the fall of the dictatorship. Its recent
attempts to introduce overdue reform in higher education,
the social services and health care have been ineffectual.
But the party is not passively conservative. The more
dynamic ministers such as Manos, Andrianopoulos and
Doxiades would like to see faster change. Rallis himself
who belongs to the left, reforming wing is ready to listen
to them, and would I guess like to be able to move faster
than the creaking machine allows. But he is a political
animal and will not give reform its head if that meant
losing his right wing.
12. My conclusion is a qualified acceptance of the thesis that
too many years in power have caused a certain sclerosis
in Greece’s administration and institutions; but rejection
of the thesis that things are so far gone that under New
Democracy Greece is condemned to economic and
political stagnation. And I do not accept that the sclerosis
will necessarily lead to the rejection of New Democracy
by the electorate in favour of a “pragmatic” Papandreou.
13. I agree with you that international affairs are unlikely to
prove decisive in the elections. The voters will be thinking
first and foremost of how to secure their own material
welfare. But do not underestimate the external factor.
Relations with Turkey could play an important role. And
membership of the Community is a special case, in that it
impinges on the voters’ pockets. It will be hard to separate
the Community issue from domestic economic issues, and
the Government will make sure that the benefits of
membership are publicized. As I have reported in my
Annual Review, the current, belated campaign to explain
and sell the European Community is having some impact.
Then and Today

63
14. Since you wrote, the possibility of Soviet intervention in
Poland has receded. But I agree with you that military
action by the Russians would certainly have a
considerable effect on the elections. It would obviously do
the KKE no good. Although he would condemn such an
intervention, it would probably lose votes for Papandreou,
since any serious crisis in international affairs would be
likely to cause the electors to look for stability and well-
worn, if imperfect, solutions. The Eurocommunist KKE
(Interior) might pick up some votes from the KKE. The
main beneficiary would be New Democracy. I have heard
it seriously suggested by politicians that a Soviet invasion
would be the one eventuality that might persuade Rallis to
abandon his objective of holding on, if possible, until the
autumn before going to the polls, in favour of a snap
election in the wake of a Polish crisis.2
Lumpendiplomacy
Whatever one’s personal views and knowledge about Greece, it is clear
that the two recent reviews (2005 and 2006) are not a patch on that for
1980 and the 1981 letter on the Greek political situation, whether in style,
grammar, informativeness, analysis or evaluation. Of course, there are one
or two minor criticisms that one can level at the 1981 letter, for example ,
use of “case in point” instead of “example”, and “connection” instead of
“connexion”, but then I am perhaps being pedantic. The differences
between the 1980 and 1981 review and letter, and the 2005 and 2006
reviews reflect what the recently retired ambassadors above told me,
namely that the collective consciousness had gone, that things are done on
the hoof and that that there is a lot of drivel. In fact, the two recent reviews
read like business reports.
While this might reflect the extraordinary language used in both the
staff handout Stakeholder Engagement and the Chief Operating Officer’s
interview above, it surely also betrays a general reduction in British
educational standards, a phenomenon that has also affected other parts of
the world, and, importantly, shows how the personal computer is
becoming a substitute for thought and thinking. That this has affected even
Her Majesty’s Diplomatic Service reflects the demise of common sense,
and more emphasis on appearance than substance. Linguistic independence

of thought and thinking is accompanied by Britain’s loss of economic and
political independence. As this extract from an e-mail to me (see Chapter
Two) from a recently retired ambassador suggests, FCO written language
is in the doldrums.
Some incisive valedictories were still being written in 2006 (eg Ivor
Roberts', Andrew Green's), so the high standard of English was still being
maintained then in parallel with the management-speak. The tragedy is
that, having subsequently banned them, the wider audience within the FCO
will have little or no access, I assume, to clear and precise analyses as
used to be committed to despatches circulated quite widely in the
Office. Reading these despatches was, as you say, a very useful learning
tool for young FCO people. Sadly, this particular tool was withdrawn and
will be a loss to present and future generations of young FCO people.
Welcome to the world of lumpendiplomacy, a world where the art of
concentrating and applying oneself to a problem has given way to tweeting
on hand-held electronic devices, and where attention spans are getting ever
shorter, to be replaced by PR-speak. We now turn to our penultimate
chapter, which sets out to show how political correctness and the
obsession with “diversity” are causing Standard English to succumb to
speed and trendiness, and to catapult itself out of existence.
CHAPTER FIVE
THE ASSAULT ON STANDARD ENGLISH
A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely
fatal.1
Killing Class
There is no very precise definition of Standard English, a reflection
perhaps of the fact that Britain has no official English Academy, as the
French have their Académie française. At an informal level, the Oxford
Dictionary tends to be the gauge of what constitutes acceptable English.
Certainly, many of the Americanisations that have crept into English, such
as “escalation”, serve a useful purpose, and have been welcomed: no
language can survive easily if it does not breathe and take in new words,
from time to time. The problem comes when perfectly good traditional
words and expressions are replaced by new ones, simply because of the
latters’ trendiness. Of course, our European friends have also been affected
by the import of new English words. Years ago, the Académie française
tried to ban the word “jumbo-jet” and bring in the words “gros-porteur”. It
failed. Today, “hoover” is used alongside “aspirateur”, “le weekend” is
regularly used in preference to “fin de semaine”, while “pipeline” has
virtually replaced the more precise “oléoduc” and “gasoduc”. In Germany,
we have regularly used Anglicisms such as “Fairness”, “clever”, “Job” and
“gekidnapped”. But I am digressing slightly: let us attempt to define
Standard English and then identify how it is being destroyed. The Concise
Oxford Dictionary defines it as “conforming to established educated
usage”. I can live with this definition, as it is one of simple common sense.
Paradoxically, it is some of the very writers on Standard English who
are killing it off by trying to relegate it to the status of a dialect, and
seemingly in the name of fashion and political correctness. Let us quote
from a recent and thought-provoking book, Discovering the Grammar you
Don’t Know.

Their campaign is not about language at all. It’s about class. It has to be,
because standard, official English is the only dialect in the language based
not on region but on socioeconomic group, being spoken by 15% of the
population, almost all of them belonging to the middle and above classes
[…] Perhaps only 5% of the British population have [sic] the Received
Pronunciation accent that goes with standard. 2
We see from the above how the question of class, with all its socio-
political baggage, is now causing some English language pundits
simplistically to dismiss Standard English as a dialect. Before criticising
this contention, let us look at the Collins Dictionary’s main definitions of
dialect:
A regional or social variety of a language distinguished by pronunciation,
grammar, or vocabulary, especially a variety of speech differing from the
standard literary language or speech pattern of the culture in which it
exists: Cockney is a dialect of English.
A variety of language that with other varieties constitutes a single
language of which no single variety is standard: the dialects of Ancient
Greek.
The closest we get to the claim that “standard, official English” is a dialect
is the phrase “social variety”. But is standard English simply a social
variety? And if so, what is the social group? And how can Standard
English be a dialect if, to qualify as a dialect, it must differ “from the
standard literary language or speech pattern of the culture in which it
exists”? In other words, it appears that even highly educated people like
Ritchie may have subliminally succumbed to a certain amount of political
correctness.
As the teaching of English has spread worldwide and become a sine
qua non for foreigners wishing to get on in life, this has obviously affected
Standard English to some extent, but in a healthy way. The imperial
approach to teaching English to the natives, along with the British way of
life, resulted in various words and expressions coming into Standard
English, such as “bungalow”, and “chop-chop”. This is of course part of
the process of language enrichment that has affected English more than
most languages, owing to its worldwide diffusion and the natural
interlinking of Standard English with local dialects and usage. But now
there is a tendency, again on the part of experts at writing and teaching

The Assault on Standard English

Standard English, to claim that the latter is a problem, as the following
suggests.
Traditionally, native speakers of English have been regarded as providing
the authoritative standard and the best teachers. Now, they may be seen as
presenting an obstacle to the free development of global English. Native
speakers of English have promoted the learning of their language abroad.
By the end of the 20th century less effort seemed to be required, as
learning English became seen [sic] no longer as an option but as an urgent
economic need. Native speakers were regarded as the gold standard; as
final arbiters of quality and authority.
In the new, rapidly emerging climate, native speakers may increasingly
be identified as part of the problem than the source of a solution. They may
be seen as bringing with them cultural baggage in which learners wanting
to use English as an international language are not interested; or as ‘gold
plating’ the teaching process, making it more difficult to train teachers and
equip classrooms.3
Graddol’s perceptive observation about English being acquired by
foreigners merely shows that global English is becoming a simple method
of business communication, divorced from any notion of cultural
underpinning. As such it simplifies itself to suit business needs, full of
errors and grammatical oddities as it is. And of course some of this global
English affects some of the language of an increasingly multi-ethnic
Britain. Apart from globalisation and the consequent degrading of
Standard English generally, we have what some experts term “different
Englishes”. In Salman Rushdie’s words:
Those peoples who were once colonized by the language are now rapidly
remaking it, domesticating it, becoming more and more relaxed about the
way they use it – assisted by the English language’s enormous flexibility
and size, they are carving out large territories for themselves within its
frontiers […] The English language ceased to be the sole possession of the
English some time ago.’4
In this connexion, Orwell wrote: “What is above all needed is to let the
meaning choose the word, and not the other way round”.5
Here we are,
however, talking about Standard English being adapted, and, in a sense,
improved to suit local cultures. But this contrasts vividly with the

homogenised, globalised and over-simplified English to which the FCO
appears to be succumbing. David Crystal introduces a measure of common
sense into the debate:
There need be no conflict: it is perfectly possible for a country to maintain
the place of standard English in its schools and social structure without
denigrating the local accents and dialects which comprise its constituent
group identities.6
This suggestion can be applied both to Britain, with its various dialects,
and abroad. But with the new fast-food learning of globalised English,
both Standard English, with its overseas variations, and English dialects
themselves, are coming under increasing threat. Let us now try to infuse
some common sense into the question of Standard English.
Class, Diversity and Political Correctness
To claim that Standard English is a dialect, and that it is the preserve of the
“middle and above classes”, based not on region but on socio-economic
group, is to paint a Manichean and warped picture. David Crystal says that
Standard English is connected to class preservation. 7
In contrast, I think
that Standard English is not so much connected to simple class preservation
as to education. As the obsession with “diversity” and political correctness
has reached new heights, so has Standard English come to be increasingly
associated with “class” and, therefore, with the idea that the more
privileged one is, the more likely one is to use Standard English. To quote
one of my students8
, the only reason that dialects of English exist, is that
Standard English exists. This is precisely because Standard English is not
a dialect, nor inextricably connected to class. While it can be argued that
Standard English grew out of the English spoken and written in an area
stretching from the Humber southwards to the Thames area, and from the
east coast westwards to the Severn, it was the intellectual and commercial
predominance of the area that led to the eventual adaptation of what we
call Standard English, which was then used countrywide in written form,
notwithstanding the differences in speech, pronunciation, and the use of
different words. In 1387, John of Trevisa wrote: “Men of myddel
Engelond, as hyt were parteners of the endes, vnderstondeth betre the syde

longages, Northeron and Southeron, than Northeron and Southeron
vnderstondeth eyther other.”9
Less than one hundred years later, William
Caxton’s printing press in 1476 put the final seal of approval on Standard
English.
The connexion with class comes with spoken English rather than
written, an important distinction, since many who speak in regional
accents can nevertheless write good quality Standard English. I have heard
a very well educated Cumbrian say: “Aas gaan doon te t’holm te laek
aboot a bit at’t beck”, which means: “I am going down to the field to play
about a bit by the stream.” This Cumbrian can however write high quality
educated Standard English, and speak using the words “field”, “play” and
“stream”. The question of Standard English is connected more to
education, the great leveller, than to class. The idiocy of political
correctness however introduces a strong element of snobbery into the
equation, a snobbery born of the politically correct brigade, who think that
equal rights means that we must all be reduced to the same common
denominator, speaking and writing the same form of global English. In
short, the increasing speed of communications, the “dumbing-down” of
education, political correctness and its concomitant forced egalitarianism,
and the introduction of marketing expressions into mainstream English,
are eating away at the core of good, traditional Standard English. And
even if some speakers of Standard English, the five per cent or so who
speak with a “Received Pronunciation”, consider that their pronunciation
is connected to class, is that necessarily a bad thing? Must we all become
homogenised linguistically and socially? Just as some Londoners will say:
“I’m goin’ down the pub”, so others will say: “I’m going to the pub”. It is
differences and nuances such as these which represent the richness of
English culture.
This is a good point at which to consider how, and to what extent,
external influences have played, and are playing, a role in the social
development of Britain, and whether they will eventually lead to a so-
called “classless society”. These days, in so-called “multi-cultural
Britain”, it is important to be seen to be in favour of equal opportunity.
Thus, tradition has come to be seen by many as equating – rightly or
wrongly – with elitism. This is surely one of the factors that induced my
old school, St. Paul’s, to introduce football into its sports curriculum, to
keep the “equalisers” at bay. Political correctness is generally agreed to
have begun in America, mainly via the so-called “New Left”. Given
Britain’s close linguistic, business, emotional and other ties with America,

it was inevitable that it would cross the Atlantic, to America’s European
“Trojan Horse”, and thence creep into Europe. Thus, people are no longer
handicapped, but “physically challenged”, and are “vertically challenged”,
rather than short. In some English state schools, children are not allowed
to mention their mother and father, for fear of upsetting those with two
mothers or two fathers. And they are taught, at the age of seven, that
homosexuality is acceptable. A Christian relationship counsellor was
sacked for refusing to help homosexual couples with the intimate details of
their sex lives. The promoters of alleged equality consider it patronising to
hold open a door for a woman.
These are but some random examples of a frightened society that no
longer has the confidence to live and let live, but prefers to be slowly
standardised and subtly brainwashed by a small group of ideologically
motivated power-seekers perhaps trying to get rid of their own frustrations
by interfering in the everyday lives of decent citizens.
Gender and colour also come in for similar treatment. In the manic
crusade to reduce everybody to the lowest common denominator of
alleged equality, positive discrimination has now come into its own. For
example, the British police now have to employ a certain percentage of so-
called “ethnic minority groups”. In some cases, this leads to equally or
better qualified white candidates being turned down for a job. Apart from
that, any kind of discrimination, whether “positive” or not, is insulting to
the targeted groups. It is akin to giving them a handicap, because they are
not considered good enough. According to this kind of excessive and
pedantic logic, the Paraplegic Olympics should be merged with the
Olympic Games, with handicapped competitors being given various
handicaps. For example, certain handicapped people would begin the one
hundred metre sprint with a fifty metre head start, while an able-bodied
boxer would box with one hand tied behind his back. Thames Rowing
Club has not succumbed to this mentality: one oarsman had only one
properly working leg, yet could hold his own, and beat many others.
Precisely because he was given no handicap, he was seen as an equal to,
and even better than, his more able-bodied fellow oarsmen.
The upshot of all this “anti-common sense” is that it leads to dangerous
tensions within society, by creating exaggerated awareness of other
people’s private lives, sexual habits, colour and gender, things that should
simply be left alone. This PC culture of equality is paradoxically leading
to apartheid and prejudice, the very things that it claims to be trying to
stop. The well-known English adage “live and let live” seems to be under
attack. The paradox is that party-politically motivated attempts to create a
classless society are creating more, not less, class prejudice. This has been
The Assault on Standard English

71
accompanied with the dumbing down (I accept this expression) of our
language. Inverted snobbery, especially of the linguistic kind, is another
fairly recent example of the over-simplification of Standard English. A
good example is to listen to Prince Harry speaking to cadets. His speech
hints at incipient glottal stops, and is certainly not the Received
Pronunciation of his grandmother, or even of his mother. It may also be
slightly contrived, perhaps unconsciously.
Is Standard English Dead?
I admit that although this may appear to be a rather rhetorical question, it
has some validity, particularly if we consider some of the language that we
have looked at, even within the FCO, which houses some of Britain’s best
brains, however embarrassing to the FCO’s Human Resources Directorate
it might be to admit to élitist tendencies. We do, however, seem to be
witnessing an attack on Standard English, a result of a combination of the
over-simplification occasioned by global English, the general fall in
educational standards, electronic communication and the associated
obsession with speed and deadlines and, yes, I mention it again, the
advance of the PC brigades. The biggest attack has not come from
America – the Americans have not concocted a conspiracy to destroy
Standard English – but from ourselves. The apparent transformation of
FCO written English is a valid gauge, as we saw in Chapters Three and
Four. If the élite of the Civil Service is producing drivel, and writing less
and less in good quality Standard English, then the latter is, if not dead, at
least suffering from some form of socio-politico linguistic disease.
The more this continues, the more sloganised business English enters
the language of diplomats, those semantic defenders of British identity,
then the more linguistic anarchy we shall have, with the resulting loss of
clarity. A language needs a compass to keep its identity. If Standard
English is to be considered a dying dialect, then British identity suffers.
The continent of Europe has also affected English, and not always
beneficially: thus, official British documents sometimes use the word
“action”, instead of “scheme”, project” or “measure”, “actual” rather than
“current” or “present”, “agent” in place of “employee” or “official”, and
“competences” as a substitute for “powers” or “jurisdiction”. There are
many other examples, some of them the result of Americanisms having
Chapter Five
72
entered the official English used in Brussels, and others the result of
Frenchisms.10
Standard English is certainly in trouble.
2080
Could the following be written about our language in 2080?
The language of the home, and usually also of the fields, the village street
and the market, is English, a Germanic language. It seems to be closer to
American than to German. It is corrupt and debased, without a literature
or a fixed grammar, although until around 2025 there was a literature,
based on what was then known as Standard English. With the slow death of
Standard English, an increasingly large number of borrowings entered the
language, mainly from the Caribbean, Pakistan, Romania, Bulgaria,
America and Poland. Enclaves of Standard English do still exist, but only
in Cornwall, Cumbria and the north-east of Northumbria, where they have
blended with the previous dialects. And, of course, at some Oxford and
Cambridge colleges, where it is now considered a dead language, written
more than spoken, just as I am writing in a dead language.11
This future writer, writing perhaps himself – paradoxically – in clear
English, might then refer to the Scottish and Welsh languages as also
influencing English. To return, however, to an underlying theme of our
book, and given the fact that language is a vital part of identity, there must
be a strong argument for going backwards instead of forwards. Consider
this:
The linguistic training of Latin, emphasising as it does constant processes
of analysis and synthesis, teaches clarity and precision of thought, lucidity
of expression in English, and in particular the ability to distinguish the
thought and the form in which it is expressed.12
To this I would add ancient Greek. It is hardly a surprise to know that
some of the best examples of diplomatic writing have been given by
diplomats trained in the classics. Before deciding on whether Standard

The Assault on Standard English

English is dying, let me quote from a former schoolmaster of mine, John
Bayliss.
Bayliss’ Law of Punctuation.
1. An essay is like a formal meal: it has distinct and different parts;
a beginning, (several) middle(s) and an end. The end does not
repeat the beginning; rather, it provokes a satisfied sigh (rather
than a burp!).
2. Similarly, a paragraph is a self-contained course.
3. Within the paragraph-course, the sentence is a mouthful; the full
stop says: “Swallow this before proceeding.” Similarly, the comma
is a pause in the chewing of a long sentence-mouthful: take a short
breath, or hiccups may result.
4. The larger sub-stops are designed for a major tit-bit, to wit the
colon and semi-colon.
5. The colon is a splendidly economical shorthand device. It says:
“I will explain…” (It is also used to introduce a quotation.)
6. The semi-colon juxtaposes two halves of a balanced sentence,
like the fulcrum of a seesaw: A ; B
It replaces a conjunction such as ‘whereas’, ‘and’, ‘yet’ etc..
7. In a multiple explanation the s/c is used to offset equal elements:
A : X : Y ; Z.
(After the initial colon.)
Bon appétit!
You readers have probably realised that I am arguing that past excellence
can help Standard English, and therefore English itself, to survive as a
decent language. There is no doubt that some of the best forms of written
English were translated from the Latin. Saint Gilda and the Venerable
Bede spring immediately to mind. This influenced the structure of English
Chapter Five
74
irrevocably, just as Latin had influenced French, which in turn led to
Middle English (viz. Langland and Chaucer, and the classics-influenced
Shakespeare and others of his era). And class pure and simple did not play
a vital role in the writings of these literary genii: Langland was a poor
man, and Shakespeare the son of a glover, respectable perhaps, but a trader
nevertheless, without aristocratic connexions. Education, as I have said, is
a great leveller, and a natural one, to boot. I conclude that Standard
English is not by any means dead, but that it is suffering from a disease
which, if not checked, could lead to the situation as I have described it –
with not even a tiny part of my tongue in my cheek – in 2080. Let us now
return to the essential theme and title of this book in my brief concluding
chapter. The link is our collective memory, which appears to have affected
not only Standard English, but the work of the FCO, which I have taken as
a gauge of the state of our language and, indeed of our room for
manoeuvre as a country.
CHAPTER SIX
BRITAIN’S LOST FREEDOM
The sad answer is, I’m afraid, that the Cold War produced in us a kind of
vicarious colonialism. On the one hand we abandoned nearly every article
of our national identity to American foreign policy. On the other we bought
ourselves a stay of execution for our vision of our colonial selves. Worse
still, we encouraged the Americans to behave in the same way. Not that
they needed to have our encouragement, but they were pleased to have it,
naturally.1
Dying Memory: Senile Dementia
Given the current rushed writing, or rather keyboarding, of FCO written
communication, in conjunction with less fastidious training for budding
diplomats, much of it now subsumed into the Civil Service as a whole, it is
fair to conclude that the collective memory is going, as one of my recently
retired ambassadors commented above. This loss of memory is leading to
a lack of continuity in the formulation of foreign policy, often done on the
hoof.
Talking of memory, I remember how in the mid-Seventies, on any
important matter, we always consulted the Americans. Edward Heath, who
was the last of the Brito-European Mohicans, and was suspicious of Henry
Kissinger, had lost the elections, giving way to a weak Wilson as Prime
Minister, and an even weaker Callaghan as Foreign Secretary. Wilson and
Callaghan both succumbed to US dictates. First, when Britain tried to give
up its military bases on Cyprus, following the Turkish invasion, America
simply said no.2
Then there was the unfortunate case of the inhabitants of
Diego Garcia (which I have mentioned earlier), the island rented to the

Americans for military purposes, which meant that its two thousand
inhabitants, British subjects, were forced to leave. For good measure, their
animals were gassed. When the islanders began to win their case in the
courts, Her Majesty the Queen was simply prevailed upon (by Blair’s
“diversity” government!) to sign an “Order in Council”, thus betraying her
own subjects.
Such stories of Britain giving in to her North American cousins may
not even be remembered by most young diplomats today, with their
Blackberries, tweeting, “hot desking”, lack of registries and ever faster
communication. They will of course remember Blairite Britain’s unilateral
and illegal attack on Iraq, an example of what many would describe as
subservience to American objectives. The FCO was simply bamboozled
by Blair and his acolytes into the whole illegal charade. Many decent older
diplomats were furious, and we have seen above how the Deputy Legal
Adviser resigned.
I must now bite the bullet and suggest that Britain has lost more
freedom to the North American Continent than to the European one,
notwithstanding arguments that the countries of the world are all
interdependent, albeit to varying degrees. In Europe, Britain has not so
much lost a measure of independence, as agreed to share sovereignty in
various areas, and has been allowed to opt out in others. Of course, since
far fewer British people speak a foreign language than their European
counterparts, past European “federast” attempts to unite politically and
militarily have simply been stopped by America, using Britain as its EU
spokesman. NATO rules, and the EU must remain subservient to Anglo-
Saxendom. The weakening Wilson did at least say in 1975:
There is no future for Europe, or for Britain, if we allow American
business and American industry to dominate the strategic growth of our
individual countries that [sic] they, and not we, are able to determine the
pace and direction of Europe’s industrial advance [...]. 3
But plus ça change: twenty seven years later, the Blairite Minister of
Defence, Hoon, was saying: “NATO is and will be the only organisation
for collective defence in Europe.”4
He could well have been echoing
Margaret Thatcher. There is indeed a curious automaticity about British

foreign policy these days, an automaticity that reflects American policy. It
is sufficient to consider the numerous US military bases in Britain. Britain
echoes the US on any important matter, be it the attack on Libya, the
attempted one on Syria, and the criticism levelled at Russia over the
Ukraine. One important development has been the about-turn of the
Franco-German axis on NATO’s attempts to become a world policeman:
while in 2003, the two countries were united in their opposition to the
illegal attack on Iraq, now they are toeing the NATO/Anglo-Saxendom
line on Syria and the Ukraine. Britain plays the role, in Gaullist
terminology, of the American Trojan Horse. Edward Heath would
probably agree. There have been a few glimmers of hope for those who
would like Britain to have more freedom of action vis-à-vis America. One
was the British government’s refusal to allow the extradition of the hacker
Gary McKinnon to America, under a bilateral extradition arrangement that
allowed British subjects to be extradited to the US on prima facie
evidence, but not vice-versa. The other was Parliament’s vote not to attack
Syria. But this infuriated both the US and British governments.
Globalisation: Divide and Rule
Marshal McLuhan is perhaps best known for his comment about the world
being a global village, even predicting the Internet’s commercialisation
some thirty years before it happened. The term “information explosion” is
no exaggeration, reflecting the electronic side of globalisation. The
question has to be asked whether the whole globalisation fetish has really
improved co-operation in the world. Although people can communicate
with each other at the touch of a fingertip, copying simultaneously to even
thousands of others, the quality of language has decreased drastically,
particularly when many non-English people use their error-laden version
of English, the latter then being accepted as a new and fashionable version
of the language. While the Internet has aided the spread of business and
government messages to the masses, the sheer volume and speed of these
messages has ended up confusing many.
Abuse of technology runs rife: part of the reason for the many ill-fated
“revolutions” that have characterised the world since the fall of the Berlin
Wall can be found in use of the i-pod, simply to get people to come out
and protest, but with little analysis or evaluation. The very novelty of these
new forms of immediate communication tend to obscure a considered
approach to difficulties, often through over-simplified language. At any
event, globalisation, at least at the electronic level, certainly confuses.
Conspiracy theory apart, we have the intriguing notion that it is easier to
Chapter Six
78
confuse in order to control, than to control in order to confuse: power
without responsibility is simpler than responsibility without power.
This connects to the notion of a “world without borders”. While this
slogan suits large corporations, it does not reflect reality, namely that
borders have become even more important than hitherto, the main reason,
perhaps, being that since the alleged end of the Cold War, many new
nation states have come into being, many wars have been fought, and are
being fought, and separatism has become a fashion. The paradox is that in
the name of breaking down borders (a meaningless concept if you have the
space to stop and think for even a moment), people are nervous about their
identity, and therefore tend to emphasise what they think it is, or what they
are told to think it is. A good example is that of the Former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia, which obtained statehood with the break-up of
Yugoslavia, although it had never been a proper nation, let alone a
homogeneous one: one third Albanian (mainly Gheg), and two thirds
Bulgarised Serb (at least linguistically), with various other religious and
ethnic entities, it has had to pretend that it originated with the ancient
Macedonian Greeks, a farcical contention when one considers that the
Slavs arrived in the area over one thousand years after the age of
Alexander the Great. And they certainly did not speak Greek, as did the
real Macedonians. Thus we find that the so-called “empowerment” that a
globally electronic world gives to people actually makes many of them
define themselves in relation to others, rather than within themselves. This
leads to strife, by increasing, rather than decreasing, people’s differences.
The communication of over-simplified language in the name of improved
communication ends up damaging and distorting that very communication.
Globalisation, then, actually increases the power of strong countries over
weaker ones. This is simply blatant power politics/political realism, in the
name, paradoxically – or, better, hypocritically – of freedom.
Language the Key
Bearing in mind Bismarck’s prediction that the biggest event of the
twentieth century would be the fact that the North Americans spoke
English, and my own that in the twenty-first century the main factor will
be that the English speak and write North American, let us go back to the
overtly imperial age (as opposed to the current covert one), and then move
up to the present. In 1869, the Liberal Member of Parliament Charles
Britain’s Lost Freedom

79
Dilke wrote that “through America, England was speaking to the world”.5
He saw America as the agent of Anglo-Saxon domination, predicting a
great racial conflict from which “Saxondom would rise triumphant”, with
China, Japan, Africa and South America soon falling to the all-conquering
Anglo-Saxon, and Italy Spain, France and Russia “becoming pygmies by
the side of such people”.6
It was around this time that the English language
was beginning its inexorable march around the globe, so that by the time
of the loss of most of the British Empire, English was already spoken and
written globally, with many Commonwealth countries even adopting it as
an official language. The globalisation of business that resulted from the
Marshall Plan and the spread of American multinational corporations had
a massive impact on global English, even playing a role in its creation.
Today, one can talk with impunity about the “businessification of the
English language”.7
It is the business-influenced sloganised language that
we have seen in this little book that has accompanied the weakening of
British sovereignty, a process that happened to occur as our FCO language
was increasingly turning to American business phraseology. Thus my
rather dramatic-sounding phrase “post-imperial hegemonolinguistic rigor
mortis” may not be wide of the mark. The fact that it has infected the élite
of the Civil Service is significant. One highly educated individual puts the
problem particularly bluntly: “It is not modernisation of the language, nor
even manipulation, but rather masturbation.”8
To Conclude
When I began thinking about writing this book, one of the titles I
considered, was: Is the FCO Losing its Compass? Then I thought better of
it, since I would have had to undertake years of research, apart from which
the title was too vague. Yet there is a connexion; it has to do with FCO
writing, which was, as we have seen, of a high quality. But recently, as we
have seen, it is fair to say that the FCO’s linguistic compass is perhaps
being lost. Deep analysis and evaluation, so vital to serious and considered
decision-making, seem to have given way to fashionable politically correct
business/management-speak, and fast-food e-mailing, all at the same time

as British foreign policy aims are being subsumed into American ones.
The Iraq farrago had a deep psychological effect on FCO morale, and will
continue to do so. Apart from having to support American objectives that
were incompatible with international law, British diplomats saw how the
Special Intelligence Service had become virtually a branch of the CIA.
The so-called Blairite “culture”, if it can be called that, seems to have had
a damaging effect on morale, as has the Iraq farrago. Just as FCO writing
is a gauge of Standard English, so is the latter an important medium for
keeping the finger on the pulse of British identity, which is in turn an
important FCO task. This can only be done properly if there is a collective
consciousness, and things are not done on the hoof. “Drawing a line under
things”, “going forward”, “being shoulder to shoulder”, “being fit for
purpose”, “performance targets”, “cutting edges”, “stakeholder management”,
“tweeting”, “hot desking” and the like, none of these augurs well for the
continuity so necessary to Britain’s future freedom. The FCO needs to get
back to basics, rather than be entirely subsumed into the broad Civil
Service, whatever petty jealousies this can lead to. There is no need to fear
tradition. It’s all we have, and if we discard it, then we catapult ourselves
into incomprehension. It is time to take stock, and to put a brake on speed,
lest we break our necks.
THE END
APPENDIX A
FCO ENGLISH BOOK MATERIAL SAGA
My quest for just a few documents began in early 2011. The amount
of time it took me to obtain just a few recent papers surprised me, and
made me wonder whether today’s FCO has internal organisational
problems, despite the amount of effort it has invested in its external
image. This is the saga. For the sake of readability, simplicity and
privacy, I have deleted various extraneous titles and roles, and exact
e-mail addresses. For authenticity’s sake, I have not edited the
English. I have to say that the people with whom I dealt, in particular
Jonathan Marshall and Graham Holland, were kind, despite the
mildly farcical aspect of some of the correspondence.

Thank you for finding the time to meet me on 4 February. It goes without
saying (but not writing!) that I found our meeting helpful. If I understood
correctly, diplomatic despatches, annual reports and traditional telegrams
no longer exist, while inter- and intra- departmental minutes are now sent
electronically. You kindly offered to send me recent examples of minutes
of meetings, telegrams, letters, e-mails (former minutes) and submissions,
as well as details of drafting courses, so that I can juxtapose and then
compare them with how things were in the late Seventies. In that

the book Plain Words is still given to new entrants. I shall be happy to

It would also be particularly helpful if you were able to let me know
the key developments that have taken place, and when; for example, when
and why e-mails were introduced in place of hard-copy minutes, and when
and why despatches were 'terminated'.
I think that you kindly offered to send me the material (obviously non-
sensitive, and, if necessary, topped and tailed) via our embassy in Athens.
I spoke today about our meeting to the Political Counsellor in Athens, Lisa

Lisa,
Thanks for your e-mail today.
I do appreciate the help that you have given me in connexion with my
plans to write a book comparing internal FCO written communication in
the late seventies and today, by putting me in touch with the right people
at the beginning, and your continuing efforts to help. I must however
confess to being rather flummoxed by the apparent lack of action by
Richard and Jenny, whom I met in London, and who so kindly agreed to
help, by saying that they would send recent material (I already possess the
Seventies material) to the Embassy in Athens, including examples of
entrance examination papers. I know that with all the bombing, crisis-
planning and meetings, things must be busy, but I really think that they
could spare the small amount of time to fulfil their kind undertaking. It is
now well over two months since I met them. I am a serious author who
wishes to write a serious book (rather than the kind of bitter
Economist/Spectator anti-FCO linguistic point-scoring that I have seen!),
that will probably stand the office in good stead, into the bargain. The only
visible action on their part has been a stalling e-mail. I can obviously turn
elsewhere within the FCO to try and obtain the material, but this would be
embarrassing and pointless. Feel free to copy this e-mail to Richard and
Jenny, if you think that it would help. I have to have the material by the
end of May at the latest, and have already had to put my literary plans on
hold. I am copying this to Lesley Craig, whom I was meant to meet in
London, but who was, I think, taken up in the bombing crisis when I
arrived for the meeting. I look forward to hearing from you.

PS When serving at our embassy in The Hague, my ambassador was shot
dead. Out of respect for him, as well as for our public profession and
professionalism, we ensured that it was ‘business as usual’. Thus I have
difficulty in seeing the current ‘crisis’ as a reason to delay even humdrum

Thanks for coming back to me again, Lisa. Could you let me know when I
can expect the help promised so long ago? I really do need to get my brain
moving soon. An important part of my work is research and writing (I am
only in Corfu once a week to teach for a few hours, and work in my study
in Athens the rest of the time). At the moment I am in a research/writing
limbo, as a result of my having taken the FCO at face value (no sarcasm,
let alone snideness intended), and dare I say that it was not bad of me to
send the embassy my whole latest book before publication? I really do not
understand the problem that Richard and Jenny have. I only need an
envelope of papers, which I know I could have dug up in a couple of
hours, had I been in their position. Anyhow, please let me know when I
can expect the papers.

Dear Dr Mallinson,
I apologise for the delay in replying. Your request for examples of recent
FCO written work has not been easy to take forward. Despite your holding
a historian’s pass the security advice has been that I cannot send you
current material. I have been trying to find a way to get round this barrier.
The Foreign Secretary has recently published examples of what he
considers the best pieces of written work that he has seen in his time in
office so far. I have had a meeting today with the ministerial support unit,
who have responsibility for all ministerial correspondence, to ask if I could
forward this material in support of your research. I was told this would not

Dear David, Ian and Stuart,
I attach a self-explanatory, but brief, saga of my correspondence with the
FCO about an intended non-polemical book on the development of
language. Is there any way that the National Archives could come up with
recent (the last few years) examples of FCO internal memos, letters,
despatches, telegrams, submissions and reports. They do not have to be on

Dear Dr Mallinson
I’d like to introduce myself as the new Deputy Head of Department
responsible for learning and development in the FCO (from last week).
I know Richard has been trying to help you get access to certain
documents for research purposes – and he’s briefed me on the difficulties
and frustrations you’ve both encountered.
I’m very sympathetic, for a number of reasons:
- I’ve just come from a long stint at the National School of Government,
where I was part of the tutor team running drafting and briefing skills
courses for civil servants across government. We had strong views about
plain English and the quality of briefing.
- I also ran our training programmes for new Ministers and Private
Offices, and got plenty of feedback from them about drafting skills.
Ministers tended to get particularly exercised, and the new Administration
has encountered the problem afresh. Private Offices spend too much of
their time on basic quality control.
- I used to run internal training courses for certain Departments. Even
there, Private Offices could be reluctant to release “best practice”
examples for internal use – which I found extraordinary.
- I have a strong connection to Greece: my wife is Greek, we visit every
year (her katagogi is the Agrinio region), and we even passed through
Corfu a couple of weeks ago.
I’d be delighted to help you and Richard cut through the bureaucracy. I
could also put you in touch with some former colleagues who may have
interesting material (one of them is Christopher Jary – you may already
know him?)
If you’re in London at all, I’d be delighted to meet up for a coffee –
otherwise perhaps we can have a chat on the phone, in the interests of
getting some progress.

Dear Dr Mallinson
Your email was passed to me by our copying department. There is
certainly material on writing standards within our FO holdings. However,
the material I am aware of dates largely from the late 19th and early 20th
century though – there is a wonderful note on ‘red tape’ and good
language written by the PUS for the FO clerks in 1892 (in FO 366/391).
The more recent records, particularly post-war, would have been
through the standard governmental selection and appraisal processes,
which normally means that much policy material is kept, but much less
administrative/training material. General searches of our catalogue might
bring up results. FCO 97 holds the selected records of the training
department (only 7 files selected): FO 97/5 relates to a diplomatic etiquette
handbook and FCO 97/7 is a CPRS paper on staff training. You could try
the holdings of the FCO library (which have been transferred to Kings
College London Library), but there might not be much, if anything, from
the 1970s onwards on this topic.
You could also contact the FCO historians. I have copied Richard
Smith, one of their number, into this email – he might be able to help, but
it may be that your existing contacts at the FCO have already done this.
Regarding examples of despatches, memos and reports, a personal visit
to select such documents would be the best way to do this – I’m afraid that

Dear Bill Sorry to miss you on Friday. I think it might work if I break this
down into smaller chunks. I know you said you wouldn’t need whole
documents, but can I test what sort of thing would be useful? Eg this
redacted extract from a recent submission, which has been used internally
as an example of good practice (but is it enough to judge early 21st
century FCO prose?) –
ISSUE 1.
HMG’s strategy for supporting the EU [x] agreement with [x], looking
ahead to possible ratification by the European Parliament in [x].
TIMING 2.
Routine. Ministers may welcome an update before travelling to the region.
Appendix A
98
BACKGROUND 3.
Negotiations on the text of the EU [x] agreement with [x] were concluded
in [x]. The text is currently going through legal scrutiny, before being
initialled and translated into Member State languages. The European
External Action Service estimate that the agreement will pass to the
European Parliament for ratification in [x] at the earliest. [redacted] We
expect EC legal advisers to advise this agreement “mixed competence”
which means that national parliaments of all Member States will need to
ratify it before it enters into force. A joint European Parliament and
national ratification process like this can take 2-3 years – assuming no
political obstacles. Obviously the submission ran on to three pages, but
quickly gets into territory where the redactions would ruin the effect. Let
me know what you think. Jonathan

Bill, sorry, this must feel like extracting teeth (or paying off the Greek

further contribution to your examination of language, here’s a sample
summary and opening paras of an “egram”, the modern equivalent of the
telegram (around for less than 10 years). Basically egrams are the same as
telegrams, and bear the Ambassador’s surname at the bottom, but they
streamlined the distribution system and these now arrive in electronic in-
boxes. I can vouch for the authenticity of the language, but obviously have
taken out any nouns, adjectives and phrases which might identify the
situation (and thereby make it classified). As with the previous example,
the redactions have to become dominant as the text gets into the detail, so
little point going beyond para 3. And as with the previous example, please
don’t replace with the name of an existing country!! (Ruritania would be
fine..) I’m wondering whether you’ve trawled through the FCO responses

Dear Information Commissioner,
You were very helpful in helping me to gain access to some FCO
documents on Cyprus in 2008 (ICO ref no: FS50115138), which resulted
in the publication of two satisfactory books. I now have a completely
different request, which I hope we can avoid naming a complaint.
For the past eleven months, I have been trying to obtain from the FCO
recent examples of despatches, submissions, telegrams (now in e-mail
form), minutes (now in e-mail form), annual reports, and details of recent
drafting courses, to enable me to write a book comparing the FCO
language of the late seventies to that of today. Anything after the year
2000 would do. I have plenty of documents from the late seventies. The
subject is completely non-polemical. Yet, as the attached saga of
correspondence with the FCO shows, the FCO seems unable to come up
with the goods. What has been provided is wholly inadequate. I need
proper documentation rather than a website with public information. In an
age when our government leaks sensitive documents to the media, I am
flummoxed as to why the FCO has been unable to top and tail (if
necessary) a few examples of the recent documents I seek, and let me have
them. They have a completely blank cheque regarding the choice of topics,
so there cannot be any security concerns. The story seems to be one of
prevarication and procrastination.
I therefore ask whether you can cut the Gordian knot and intervene, and
somehow obtain the documentation and details of drafting courses that I
need to write my book, already delayed for too long. You will, I fear, find
the attached correspondence mildly farcical, with shades of 'Yes,

Case Reference Number FS50428662
Dear Dr Mallinson
Information request to the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (the FCO)
Thank you for your correspondence in which you complain about the
FCO's decision not to release the information you requested.
The right to complain to the Information Commissioner is given under
section 50 of the Act. However, a complaint may be deemed ineligible
under section 50, if for example:
there is an undue delay before bringing a complaint to our attention, or
you have not exhausted any complaints procedure which is provided by
the public authority.
Therefore, before accepting complaints, the Commissioner generally
expects complainants to allow public authorities the opportunity to
respond to their appeal for a review of the handling of or decision
regarding their FOI request.
Although there is no statutory time set out in the Act within which public
authorities must complete a review, the Commissioner has issued guidance
on this matter. The Commissioner considers that a reasonable time for
completing an internal review is 20 working days from the date of the
request for review, and in no case should the total time taken exceed 40
working days.
I have written to the FCO to provide them with a copy of your

Dear Mr Holland
I write further to our telephone conversation today. As you are aware, the
Information Commissioner's Office has received a complaint from Dr
William Mallinson in relation to a request for information he made to the
FCO.
As you will see from the attached correspondence, Dr Mallinson initially
agreed the scope of the information he wished to see (one assumes
verbally) in a meeting with Richard Wood and Jenny Morris at the FCO.
He subsequently confirmed at least part of this request in an email on 17
February 2011.
This email would constitute a request as far as section 8 of the FOIA is
concerned, although it is clear that it was not the totality of the information
in which Dr Mallinson was interested. The subsequent chain of emails also
appears to contain additions to the requested information, and
clarifications of the request from the FCO.
Essentially, Dr Mallinson does not appear to have received what he
considers to be a satisfactory response, and states that his most recent
email of 14 December 2011. I believe this could be construed as a request
for internal review. I would be grateful if the FCO would now carry out an
internal review of this request and provide a response to Dr
Mallinson within 20 working days.
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.

Case Reference Number FS50428662
Dear Dr Mallinson
Thank you for your email dated 29 February 2012 explaining that you had
not received a response from the FCO.
I have contacted the FCO about the matter and it appears they have failed
to carry out my instruction, for which they apologised. I have spoken to
the deputy manager of the FCO's FOI department and she has undertaken
to provide a formal response to you by 30 March 2012. If the FCO
requires any further clarification about your request, they will contact you
promptly.
We expect that an authority will provide a formal response to written
requests for information within 20 working days, either providing the
information, or explaining why the information cannot be provided (in
relation to specified exemptions). In this case, you will be aware that the
Freedom of Information Act applies only to the requests for information
that you have made in writing, and not to the verbal conversations and
meetings you may have with the FCO.
I have notified our Enforcement department of the further delay in the
matter. We monitor the time it takes authorities to provide responses to
requesters, and this intelligence informs regulatory activity that we may
take in the future.

I apologise for the delay in this matter. If you are dissatisfied once you

Dear Dr Mallinson
INTERNAL REVIEW REFERENCE: FOI 0264-12
Further to your appeal to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO),
the ICO has asked that we conduct an Internal Review of your request to
see examples of FCO drafting. Although the FCO never processed your
original request for information as a request under the Freedom of
Behind the Words

115
Information Act (FOIA), we have agreed to conduct this review of how
the FCO handled your request. A copy of this reply will sent to James
Weston at the Information Commissioner’s Office.
Jan Trestain, Deputy Open Government Liaison Officer in HR, conducted
the internal review but I have finalised her draft reply today as Jan is on
leave and I wanted to comply with the ICO’s reply deadline.
Jan conducted a full examination of your request and has ascertained the
following
Your request was never submitted as a Freedom of Information (FOI)
request nor was it acknowledged as such and therefore was treated
throughout on a Business as Usual basis.
In response to your email of 4 April 2011 Richard Wood pointed you
towards the FCO website where there are many articles written by a
variety of staff for examples of FCO drafting.
On 19 May 2011, Richard wrote to you again advising that we could not
release documents for security reasons and suggested that you submitted
an FOI request. Although you declined to submit a FOI request to the
FCO, you did write to The National Archives (TNA) asking for copies of
FCO internal memos, letters, despatches etc.
You received a reply from TNA on 3 June advising you about the
information they could provide to you and informing you that a personal
visit to TNA would be the best way of selecting some examples of written
work yourself. TNA also provided you with the contact details for Richard
Smith one of the Historians at the FCO.
6 June 2011 Richard Smith (Historian) sent you details of where to find,
publicly available, the list of documents you required.
3 October 2011 Jonathan Marshall, one of the Deputy Heads in HR
Directorate sent you a paragraph, which had been used as an example of
good practice.
14 November 2011 Jonathan sent you another example of FCO drafting
and suggested you look at the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) pages on
the Parliament website for further examples.
14 December 2011 Jonathan sent you the link to the FAC pages.
Appendix A
116
Throughout the whole process, the FCO staff were helpful and explained
the time that would be involved in locating the documents and redacting
for security reasons. Jonathan made it clear that he was extremely busy
with other work but he remained hopeful that he would be able to provide
you with the information you asked for.
The FCO staff involved acted in a professional way, taking time outside
their normal duties to assist you in this matter.
After reviewing the handling of this request, I conclude that the staff you
corresponded with were trying their best to help you and provide you with
the information you were looking for. However, this request may have
been handled more swiftly had you submitted a request under the Freedom
of Information Act.
Under the Act, you could have asked for specific pieces of recorded
information and provided your request was focussed and specific we may
have been able to provide you with the information you wanted. Some
information may have been redacted under specific exemptions but these
exemptions would have been explained to you and where qualified
exemptions were used, the public interest arguments for and against the
use of the exemptions would have been explained. Richard Wood did
suggest that course of action to you in April 2011 but you declined to
submit a formal FOI request.
If you still wish to submit a request under the FOI Act can you please send
it in writing to the Information Rights Team, Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, SG/120, Old Admiralty Building, London SW1A 2PA.
Alternatively, you can submit your request by email to dp-
foi.img@fco.gov.uk. If you are not content with the outcome of this
Internal Review, you have the right to apply directly to the Information
Commissioner for a decision. You can contact the Information

Case Reference Number FS50428662
Dear Dr Mallinson
I have today received a copy of the FCO's response to you dated 30 March
2012.
If you wish the Information Commissioner to consider this matter formally
for a decision notice, I would be grateful if you would indicate this.
As you will appreciate, formal investigation and writing a decision notice
can take some time, and the initial outcome is unlikely to force the FCO to
disclose the information in the first instance (a more likely outcome being
that they would be compelled to respond properly to your request). I
would suggest that if you do wish the Commissioner to continue down the
formal route, it might also be beneficial to make a new, full Freedom of
Information request to the FCO (as suggested in their letter).
This has two benefits; first, that the request may be dealt with before the
Commissioner's formal investigation concludes, thereby providing the
information by the fastest means possible. Secondly, you will be able to
set out clearly the scope of your initial request (as our current investigation
can consider only those pieces of information set out in writing, and not
those that you discussed only verbally with the FCO during your
meetings).
I hope this information is helpful.

Dear Bill
This is just a brief email to keep you appraised of progress with your
Freedom of Information request.
I am pleased to confirm that we have been able to locate samples of all
seven items listed in your email of 02 April. Our Retrievals Departments
has completed their searches, and has sent the relevant material down to
me.
All we need do now is assess the material for any sections which may need
to be redacted. This will be carried out by the geographical desks
concerned. As soon as they have finished their task, we will be posting the
material to you.
Having told you all the good news, there is just a minor word of caution.
Depending on the time needed to clear the documents in question – and as
I have not seen them, I cannot estimate how long the redacting task will
take – we may slightly exceed the date of 6 June I mentioned in my email
of 8 May. This is solely because there is now a four-day break whilst we
hard working civil servants enjoy the Diamond Jubilee and Bank Holiday
extended weekend!
Please let me know if you have any comments or queries.
Graham Holland

Dear Bill
Firstly, please accept my personal congratulations on your fifteenth
wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, I was unable to access the Youtube
songs here at the FCO, but I did enjoy reading the blog.
Following my email last Friday, I can confirm that the documents have
arrived here, and have been sent to the appropriate desk officers to check
for any necessary redactions, hence the mention of the possible use of
Section 27 (International Relations) in my letter to you. As soon as this
Appendix A
120
checking procedure has been completed, the documents will be sent to
you.
These documents have been chosen based on the type of information you
have requested. Specimens of all the items have been selected. However,
as they are chosen based solely on your criteria of use of the English
language, I will not know until tomorrow as to the number of redactions
necessary. If there is a need to ensure that the International Relations
exemption is used broadly, it may take just slightly longer to carry out the
redactions. By slightly longer, I only visualise approximately two or three
days longer than the deadline date of 7 June. This is because – like you in
Cyprus – we have celebrated the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee this weekend.
To commemorate this event, we have been given three days’ additional
leave when we were unable to work on these documents. If there is going
to be any delay, I will let you know immediately, and will issue a short
PIT letter to ensure that deadlines are met.
Once the documents are ready, do you want me to arrange for them to be
posted to you, or do you wish to collect them from the FCO? If posted,
will you let me have an address, please.
Please let me know if you have any comments or queries.
Graham
11 June 2012
Dear Bill
As I mentioned in my email of 01 June, the redacting work has fallen foul
of the three-day public holidays last week. As such, we need to ensure that
this is completed properly so that you receive material which does not
include information covered by the various FoI exemptions, but which still
will be useful for you work with your book.
To cover this short period, I am attaching another short Public Interest
Test (PIT) letter giving a revised deadline date of 15 June. I am sorry if it
sounds like bureaucracy (which it probably does!), but it ensures that we
keep within our deadline dates.

Having spoken on Friday to my colleagues who are working on your
material, this is a pessimistic date, and they still hope to post off your
material before next Friday.
Graham
11 June 2012
Dear Bill
This is another email to keep you to keep you updated on progress on your
Freedom of Information request.
The good news is that the relevant geographical departments have now
finished their assessments of the material which our Archives Unit
selected in May. Some of the material was, after reading it, not going to be
appropriate for your purposes. Some documents, for example, contained
too much information which would have had to be redacted, leaving little
copy for you to be able to analyse.
As a result, where these types of documents were checked and found to be
not as helpful, we have replaced them with ones which we think will be
preferable. Our criteria has been to concentrate on the style of English as
opposed to the content of the documents, and to give you as few redacted
items as a result. We would hope that any redactions should cover
personal names, plus a limited amount of material which may still be
sensitive seven years later.
As I mentioned in my earlier email, we have issued another, albeit, shorter,
PIT letter which finishes this Friday. Your material will be posted at the
latest by that date, and hopefully before.
Please let me know if you have any queries.

Dear Dr Mallinson
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST – REF: 0407-12
Thank you for your request for information which we received on 02 April
2012. You requested information about:
‘…Written communication between officials:
a) minutes/records of meetings;
b) telegrams;
c) letters to and from embassies;
d) intra-and inter departmental minutes/memoranda;
e) submissions;
f) diplomatic despatches, valedictory despatches; and
g) annual reports’
I can confirm that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does
hold information falling within the terms of your request.
Copies of each of the above items are being posted to the address in
Greece which you gave me in your email of 07 June. However, a limited
amount of the information in the documents we have provided has
Behind the Words

123
information which has been redacted. This has been done under Sections
27 (international Relations) and Section 40 (Personal Information) of the
Freedom of Information ACT (FOIA).
Section 27(1)(a) (International Relations)
The application of s27(1)(a) requires us to consider the public interest test
arguments in favour of releasing and withholding the information. We
acknowledge that releasing information on this issue would increase
public knowledge about our relations with Turkey, Greece and Cyprus.
But s27(1)(a) recognises that the effective conduct of international
relations depends upon maintaining trust and confidence between
governments. If the United Kingdom does not maintain this trust and
confidence, its ability to protect and promote UK interests through
international relations will be hampered, which will not be in the public
interest. The disclosure of information detailing our relationship with the
Greek, Cypriot and Turkish governments could potentially damage the
bilateral relationship between the UK and these countries. This would
reduce the UK government's ability to protect and promote UK interests
through its relations with them, which would not be in the public interest.
For these reasons we consider that the public interest in maintaining this
exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing it.
Section 40 (2) and (3) (Personal Information)
Some of the information you have requested is personal data relating to
third parties, the disclosure of which would contravene one of the data
protection principles. In such circumstances, Sections 40(2) and (3) of the
FOIA apply. In this case, our view is that disclosure would breach the first
data protection principle. This states that personal data should be
processed fairly and lawfully. It is the fairness aspect of this principle
which, in our view, would be breached by disclosure. In such
circumstances s.40 confers an absolute exemption on disclosure. There is,
therefore, no public interest test to apply.
With regard to your other queries, we can confirm that The Complete
Plain Words, the style guide for British English by Sir Edward Gowers, is
not now given to new entrants, and has not been for some years.
The FCO’s Learning & Development Team currently offers two writing
courses to staff in the UK. These are (a) Effective Writing and (b) Writing
wit Impact. Both courses are provided by external sources. Effective
Writing is a one-day course followed by a one hour telephone coaching
session. Writing with Impact is a half-day course followed by a one and a
half hour 1-to-1 coaching session. The contact with the external sources
Appendix A
124
ended on 30 April 2012, and the courses are now offered through Civil
Service Learning.
If you are unhappy with the service you have received in relation to your
request and wish to
make a complaint or request a review of our decision, you should write to
The Information Rights Team at dp-foi.img@fco.gov.uk. Please note any
request for an internal review must be submitted within 40 working days
from the date our response was issued.
If you are not content with the outcome of your complaint, you may apply
directly to the
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) for a decision. Generally, the
ICO cannot make a decision unless you have exhausted the complaints
procedure provided by the FCO. The ICO can be contacted at:

BORIS JOHNSON’S PEOPLE
I e-mailed the office of the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to ask
whether he might like to write the foreword to my book.
Dear Boris Johnson,
Having just completed a first draft of a 40,000-word book entitled Behind
the Words - How Hegemonolingualism is Killing Britain's Freedom, about
the demise of FCO writing and the concomitant loss of our independence,
I thought that you might enjoy writing a foreword. As a former diplomat, I
have been working on some of the content with a couple of recently
retired, and worried, ambassadors.
I attach one document: a very brief summary of the book, and an even
briefer curriculum vitae.
Yours sincerely,
Bill Mallinson
Dr. William Mallinson
The reply suggests that even in Boris Johnson’s rarefied intellectual
environment, English has suffered; ‘onto’ should be ‘on to’; ‘respond
something’ should be ‘respond to something’; ‘committed with’
should be ‘committed to’; and ‘with your project’ is better than ‘on
your project’.
Appendix B
126
Dr William Mallinson,
many thanks for your email dated 21 May, which has been passed onto me
to respond.
Unfortunately, the Mayor will not be able to write a foreword to your book
as he is committed with Mayoral engagements. We wish you the best of
luck on your project.
Best wishes

WILD RIVER TROUT
Dark shadow lies beneath, no movement;
Not even a twitch of the delicate tail
While it seeks its food.
More than hidden, it is part of the river.
It darts, too quick for eye to follow,
You see it in its new position.
The upward stab, the plucking bite,
The munching seconds, invisible to you.
You see only spreading ripples,
Then the golden glint, the creamy belly,
In the evening sun.
You cast, the sudden tug shocks you,
Despite your expectation.
It pulls and judders at your soul;
Such beauty, as you take him out,
Designed for hunting fly,
To feed its perfect muscles.
Body sculpted to living perfection;
Colours glisten, yet as deep as the river.
The hazel eye stares you out
Long after the death.
Appendix C
128
It hunts your soul.
Thank God for procreation.
