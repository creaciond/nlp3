2.2 Syllable structure constraints
2.2.1 Inventories
One of the ways in which adult languages differ is in the syllable type
inventories they possess. In Optimality Theory (OT), the ranking of syllable
structure constraints with respect to faithfulness constraints determines which
syllable types are permitted in a language. If the relevant markedness constraint
outranks at least one faithfulness constraint, then the structure (e.g. codas,
complex onsets) will be absent in the language. If all faithfulness constraints are
ranked above the markedness constraint, the structure will be present.
Faithfulness constraints can be broken down into different types, depending on
the repairs that they prohibit. For example, MAX prohibits deletion and DEP
prohibits epenthesis (McCarthy & Prince, 1995). However, since I am interested
only in inventories, I will abstract away from the particular type of faithfulness
constraint, and will use the abbreviation FAITH to represent faithfulness
constraints in general.
The basic syllable structure constraints are defined below.
Table 1. Syllable structure constraints.
Constraint name Definition Violated by:
ONSET Syllables have onsets V
NOCODA Syllables don’t have codas VC
*COMPLEX[ONSET] Onsets don’t branch CCV
*COMPLEX[CODA] Codas don’t branch VCC
13
Crosslinguistically, sequences consisting of two (or more) consonants may occur
in initial, medial and final position, or in only a subset of these environments.
Generally, word-initial clusters are assumed to be complex onsets, and word
final clusters, complex codas.4
Word-medial clusters may be onsets, codas or
both, in the case in which they are divided between two separate syllables
(heterosyllabic).
The fact that a language may possess consonant clusters in one position of
the syllable (e.g. onset), but not in another (e.g. coda) is evidence for there being
separate cluster constraints that are relativized to the subconstituent:
*COMPLEX[ONSET] vs. *COMPLEX[CODA] (e.g. Blevins, 1995; Kager, 1999; Levelt & van de
Vijver, 2004). The ranking of these constraints with FAITH determines whether
clusters occur at word edges or not. If, for example, *COMPLEX[ONSET] outranks
FAITH, then word-initial consonant clusters are absent. If FAITH outranks
*COMPLEX[CODA], then complex codas are allowed. If both *COMPLEX[ONSET] and
*COMPLEX[CODA] outrank FAITH, clusters are absent at both word edges, although
they may be present medially, as long as codas are allowed (in this case, a
syllable boundary occurs between the two consonants). The following table
contains a typology of languages permitting clusters in different positions and
rankings that are consistent with such grammars.
4 Edge-appendices/adjuncts will be discussed in 2.3.4.

The rankings of crosslinguistic grammars are also held to represent possible
stages of acquisition of a language (such as English), in which clusters occur
initially, finally, and medially.6 7
While five distinct developmental stages result
from different permutations of the three markedness constraints with FAITH, the
logical combinations of cluster inventories by position are not exhaustive. For
example, missing is a grammar in which initial clusters are present but not
medial ones. This stage cannot be obtained through any ranking of syllable
structure constraints with general faithfulness constraints. If initial clusters are
permitted, FAITH outranks *COMPLEX[ONSET], and so, a complex onset should be

Jakobson (1941) and, recently, Levelt & van de Vijver (2004).

permitted medially (/VC1C2V/ → [V.C1C2V]) as well as initially.8
A different type
of constraint is necessary to account for the asymmetry in which initial clusters
are present and medial clusters absent. This latter phenomenon (positional
faithfulness) is the topic of 2.4.
To sum up, there are some purely positional asymmetries in cluster
acquisition that arise from a simple (universal) set of syllable structure
constraints. First, word-initial and word-final clusters (assumed in the default
case to be complex onsets and codas, respectively) need not arise
contemporaneously in a child's speech; clusters in one position may proceed
clusters in another.9
Second, the presence of medial clusters does not imply the
faithful production of edge clusters; even clusters that are licit word initially in
the adult language may appear first intervocalically in the child’s productions,
indication that they are heterosyllabic, thus escaping violation of *COMPLEX[ONSET].
Below I discuss some common assumptions regarding medial cluster
syllabification in English.
8 With the inclusion of ONSET and SYLLABLE CONTACT constraints, we can explain the acquisition
of word final clusters in a stage in which word medial clusters have yet to appear. If complex
codas have been acquired, both NOCODA and *COMPLEX[CODA] have been demoted beneath FAITH.
However, a consonant cluster appearing intervocalically might be reduced still given the right
ranking of constraints: /VCCV/ = *[V.CCV]: *COMPLEX[ONSET] >> FAITH; *[VCC.V]: ONSET >> FAITH;
*[VC.CV]: SYLLABLE CONTACT >> FAITH.
9 Given the existence of a pair of mutually exclusive constraints (*COMPLEX[ONSET] is violated in one
position and *COMPLEX[CODA] in another), neither position should be preferred for grammatical
reasons alone. It seems, on the contrary, at least for English, that complex codas are generally
acquired before complex onsets. See Kirk & Demuth (2003) for varying hypotheses as to what is
behind this general trend.

2.2.2 Medial clusters: principles of syllabification
Determining the syllabification of intervocalic consonant clusters is not always a
straightforward task in cases in which more than one syllabification (i.e. [VC.CV]
or [V.CCV]) conform to the phonotactics of the language, satisfying, thus, the
Principle of Legality (Kirk, 2001; Treiman & Danis, 1988; Treiman et al, 1992;
Treiman & Zukowski, 1990). When syllabification cannot be decided on this
basis, the principle of Onset Maximization has often been invoked to explain
why intervocalic consonants are associated to the following, rather than to the
preceding syllable (Berg, 2001; Clements & Keyser, 1983; Hooper, 1976; Kahn,
1976; Kirk, 2001; Pulgram, 1970; Selkirk, 1982; Treiman et al, 1992; Treiman &
Zukowski, 1990). As suggested by its name, this principle requires intervocalic
consonants to be placed in the onset of the following syllable, rather than in the
coda of the previous syllable.
Onset maximization has been conceived of as a universal principle, rather
than a rule that varies as to its application crosslinguistically. At the same time,
the onset rule (the requirement that all syllables contain onsets) applies in some
languages but not in others. In languages in which the onset rule does not hold,
hiatus (i.e. a sequence of two vowels separated by a syllable boundary) and
vowel-initial words are permitted. Within OT, one general mechanism – that of
constraint ranking – is used to account for both the restriction on syllable types in
17
addition to the syllabification of intervocalic consonants. In the first case, the
higher ranking of ONSET over FAITH prevents onsetless syllables from occurring,
as in (1).
(1) ONSET >> FAITH (onsetless syllables prohibited)
/VC/ ONSET FAITH
La. [CVC] *
b. [VC] *!
The opposite ranking holds for languages with syllable inventories including
those without onsets, shown in (2):
(2) ONSET >> FAITH (onsetless syllables allowed)
/VC/ FAITH ONSET
a. [CVC] *!
L b. [VC] *
As far as syllabification is concerned, in the case of a single intervocalic
consonant, onset maximization falls neatly out of syllable structure constraints.
Both NOCODA and ONSET prefer onset maximization, that is, for the consonant to
be syllabified as an onset to the following syllable rather than as a coda to the
preceding syllable.10
(3) Role of ONSET and NOCODA
/VCV/ ONSET NOCODA
La. [V.CV]
b. [VC.V] * *
10 But see Hammond (1999) for use of a constraint *ONSET which militates against unstressed
syllables which possess onsets.
18
As is evident in (3), ONSET and NOCODA are inherently non-conflicting. They
converge on the same optimal candidate: the one in which the intervocalic
consonant associates to the following syllable.11 However, in the case of a
sequence of two adjacent consonants, a cross-linguistic preference for placing
both consonants in the second syllable (=onset maximization) as long as they
represent a legal onset cluster (on the basis of word-initial phonotactics) is not
immediately derivable from universal constraints. While [VC.CV] violates
NOCODA and satisfies *COMPLEX[ONSET], [V.CCV] does the reverse. It is consistent
with standard assumptions of universal violable constraints that the tendency to
maximize as opposed to minimize onsets should be decided on a language
specific basis. Two possible outcomes, based on opposite rankings, are shown
below.
(4) NOCODA >> *COMPLEX[ONSET] VS. *COMPLEX[ONSET] >> NOCODA
/VCCV/ NOCODA *COMPLEX[ONSET]
La. [V.CCV] *
b. [VC.CV] *!
/VCCV/ *COMPLEX[ONSET] NOCODA
Lc. [VC.CV] *
d. [V.CCV] *!
Assuming that in both of these languages, complex onsets are permitted (on the
basis of word-edge phonotactics), the candidate in which the onset is maximized
11 This holds even in languages that permit violation of both constraints (English, for example).
19
(4a) is the result of the higher ranking of NOCODA, while when the ranking is
reversed, the candidate containing the heterosyllabic cluster (4c) is selected.
Psycholinguistic experiments have attempted to tap into native speakers’
knowledge of syllable boundaries through a variety of metalinguistic tasks.
Results of a study of syllabification preferences in Finnish and German (Berg &
Niemi, 2000) find that onsets tend to be maximized in German and minimized in
Finnish. Given an intervocalic consonant cluster (CC), both consonants tended to
be placed in onset position in German, whereas in Finnish, they were more often
divided between two syllables. These results mirror the two possible grammars
illustrated in tableau (4).12
Similar such investigations in English, in addition to other languages,
reveal that the extent to which intervocalic clusters associate to the following
syllable depends on factors such as cluster type (e.g. stop-liquid vs. sC), stress,
and vowel quality (e.g. Kirk, 2001; Treiman & Danis, 1988; Treiman et al, 1992;
Treiman & Zukowksi, 1990). I will review the results of these studies in each of
the relevant sections after discussing the specific constraints and constraint
interactions involved. The next section addresses the role of sonority in
12 It appears that overall frequency of structure (e.g. complex onsets or codas) in a language may
play a role in these results. However, the greater frequency of codas with respect to onsets in
Finnish is NOT the explanation for this crosslinguistic difference: in Finnish, open syllables are
more common than closed syllables, while in German, the opposite is true. The authors suggest
that the asymmetry may simply be the result of the greater frequency of complex onsets in
German with respect to Finnish.

producing asymmetries in cluster phonotactics in both medial and initial
position.
2.3 Sonority
2.3.1 Introduction
Sonority constraints influence the way in which segments are assigned to
syllables within a string, playing an important role in phonotactics in so far as
they restrict the nature of syllable-initial and syllable-final segments and
sequences (Blevins, 1995; Clements, 1990; Clements & Keyser, 1983; Grammont,
1933; Hooper, 1976; Jespersen, 1904; Kiparsky, 1979; Prince & Smolensky,
1993/2004; Selkirk, 1984; Sievers, 1881; Steriade, 1982).
The ideal syllable is one in which sonority starts off maximally low and
increases towards the nucleus of the syllable. Ideally the syllable ends in a
vowel; however, in the case in which postvocalic consonants are present,
sonority should decline gradually towards the end of the syllable, meaning that
the postvocalic consonant should be less sonorous than the nucleus, but not by
the maximal decrement.13 The following scale, proposed by Clements (1990),
begins with the least sonorous segments on the left.
(5) Obstruents < Nasals < Liquids < Glides < Vowels
13 Sonority can derive in the same way the basic syllable structure constraints ONSET and NOCODA,
and possibly *COMPLEX[ONSET] and *COMPLEX[CODA]. However, I have chosen to present these as
separate bodies of constraints for simplicity of exposition.
21
In the scale in (5), stops and fricatives are equivalent in sonority; however, it has
been assumed that the extent of specificity needed in a sonority scale is language
specific, with some languages exploiting finer distinctions than others (Baertsch,
2002; Fikkert, 1994; Selkirk, 1984; Steriade, 1982). For the purposes of the
comparisons I focus on in this thesis, I will assume the following hierarchy:
(6) Stop < Fricative < Nasal < Liquid < Glide < Vowel
1 2 3 4 5 6
The sections that follow outline predictions made by different aspects of sonority
theory. Applied to cluster acquisition, MARGIN constraints are relevant to the
choice of which consonant to retain in stages in which clusters are reduced
(=deleted); SONORITY SEQUENCING (MINIMAL DISTANCE) and SYLLABLE-CONTACT
hierarchies are predicted to influence the order in which different initial and
medial (heterosyllabic) sequences are faithfully produced.
2.3.2 Margin constraints
The Margin Hierarchy (Prince & Smolensky, 1993/2004) constitutes a fixed
ranking of constraints: the constraint at the top of the scale prohibits the most
sonorous of all elements (e.g. vowels) from being a syllable margin. On account
of the fixed ranking, predictions of an implicational nature can be made. For
example, if a language allows liquids as onsets, it should also allow stops, but
not necessarily vice-versa. Proceeding down the hierarchy, the lower the
22
constraints are ranked, the less sonorous are the consonants they target. Lower
ranked constraints in the hierarchy are violated quite frequently in adult
languages. A version of that hierarchy is given below:
(7) *M/GLIDE >> *M/LIQUID >> *M/NASAL >> *M/FRICATIVE14
In Prince & Smolensky’s (1993/2004) Margin Hierarchy, no distinction was made
between onset and coda. However, important differences between the two
positions exist which are relevant to sonority. While crosslinguistically, better
onsets are the less sonorous consonants, preferred codas tend to be more
sonorous (e.g. Gnanadesikan, 2004; Ohala, 1996; Prince & Smolenksy, 1993/2004).
A refinement of this hierarchy requires, therefore, a breakdown of the MARGIN
family into separate constraints targeting onsets and codas, respectively, as
below (Baertsch, 2002; Gnanadesikan, 2004; Ohala, 1996; Pater, 1997; Pater &
Barlow, 2003, etc.)
(8) *ONSET/GLIDE >> *ONSET/LIQUID >> *ONSET/NASAL >> *ONSET/FRICATIVE
(9) *CODA/STOP >> *CODA/FRICATIVE >> *CODA/NASAL >> *CODA/LIQUID
The relevance of the rankings in (8) and (9) to cluster acquisition is that in stages
in which clusters are reduced, the choice of which consonant to preserve should
reflect the sonority hierarchy for the particular syllable margin in question
14 The Peak Hierarchy (Prince & Smolensky, 1993/2004) is a simple reversal of the ranking above,
with Peak substituted for Margin. This fixed ranking expresses the cross-linguistic preference for
vowels to be syllable nuclei, followed by other sonorants, such as liquids and nasals.
23
(Ohala, 1996). For example, if s-stop clusters are reduced in onset position, the
stop should be retained, as should the stop of stop-approximant onset clusters.
The opposite prediction holds for codas: fricatives are better codas than stops,
and sonorants are better codas than obstruents.
2.3.3 Sonority sequencing and minimal distance constraints
The Sonority Sequencing Generalization or Principle (SSP) (e.g. Clements &
Keyser, 1983; Clements, 1990; Hooper, 1976; Steriade, 1982) is responsible for
restricting the inventory of word-initial and word-final clusters that appear
crosslinguistically. It reflects the requirement that segments be arranged in order
of increasing sonority from the syllable margins to the syllable nuclei. This
amounts to a restriction on sequences of consonants that make up onset (and
coda) clusters: if part of the same syllable and preceding the nucleus, C1 must
have a sonority value less than that of C2. In fact, crosslinguistically, word-initial
clusters containing a sonority rise between C1 & C2 are common, whereas clusters
in which a sonority reversal occurs are relatively rare (Baertsch, 2002; Clements,
1990; Grammont, 1933; Hooper, 1976; Sievers, 1881, etc.).
Furthermore, constraints have been posited that require there to be a
minimum sonority rise between C1 & C2, expressible in number of degrees
(Borowsky, 1986; Broselow & Finer, 1991; Selkirk, 1984; Sievers, 1881; Steriade,
1982). MINIMAL SONORITY DISTANCE constraints provide an explanation for why
24
stop-liquid clusters are present in English, but not stop-fricative clusters.15
Like the
Margin hierarchy, MINIMAL DISTANCE constraints are also assumed to be in a fixed
ranking, e.g. MINDIST = 1 >> MINDIST = 2 >> MINDIST = 3, etc. This should result in
variation across languages in terms of the minimal distance required between
consonants within an onset cluster. For example, while English allows, with the
exception of /sC/ clusters, only obstruent-approximant clusters as onsets,
German allows both obstruent-approximant and obstruent-nasal clusters. This
implies that FAITH is inserted lower in the hierarchy of minimal distance
constraints for English than it is for German. Adopting the more general
sonority scale from (5), repeated in (10), I illustrate the difference between the
two languages in the tableaux below.
(10) obstruents < nasals < liquids < glides
1 2 3 4
15 However, using MINIMAL DISTANCE constraints to account for some clusters which are absent in
English has the unfortunate consequence of overgeneralizing their effect. For example, if we
claim that stop-nasal clusters are disallowed because stops and nasals are too close in sonority
(assuming the sonority scale in (5), the difference is 2), then we have a difficult time explaining
the presence of fricative-liquid clusters (e.g. /fl/, /sl/), which also constitute a difference of 2
degrees on the sonority scale. By collapsing categories of stop and fricative into obstruent, we
obtain a difference of 2 between /f/ and /l/, but now a difference of just 1 between /p/ and /n/.
However, we are still left with explaining the presence of s-nasal clusters.

The difference in the phonotactics of these languages can be captured by the
different restrictions on the sonority distance between two adjacent consonants
in onset position. German allows these two consonants to be closer in sonority
than does English, because FAITH has a higher ranking in German with respect to
the MINIMAL DISTANCE constraint hierarchy.16
The SSP and MINIMAL DISTANCE constraints, when applied to phonological
acquisition, are predicted to influence the order in which complex onsets and
complex codas of differing segmental combinations are acquired. The prediction
16 Clements’ (1990) Dispersion Theory makes somewhat different predictions from Minimal
Distance constraints as to the optimal complex onset. While a theory of Minimal Distance would
suggest that a syllable composed of OGV (onset-glide-vowel) would be preferred over one
composed of OLV (onset-liquid-vowel), because the sonority distance between the obstruent and
glide is greater than that between the obstruent and liquid, Dispersion Theory (Clements 1990)
holds OLV to be the ideal syllable (or initial demisyllable) because the distance between
obstruent and liquid is relatively equivalent to the sonority distance between liquid and vowel.
26
is that among onset clusters, children will acquire somewhat earlier those in
which the sonority distance between the two consonants is maximized (e.g. stop-
liquid/stop-glide), rather than those in which a sonority plateau or reversal
occurs (e.g. s-stop).
2.3.4 SSP violation vs. extraprosodicity in initial s-stop clusters
In English, among other languages including German, Dutch, Italian, etc.,
sonority sequencing is respected as a whole, but not in words beginning with /s/
- stop clusters. These clusters represent clear violations of SSP if they are complex
onsets, as there is a fall, rather than a rise from C1 to C2. In OT, the notion of
universally inviolable constraints does not exist; it is expected that SSP, as a
violable constraint, will be violated in some languages and respected in others.
However, s-stop clusters are the only ones that violate sonority sequencing in
English, and furthermore, many other word-initial clusters constituting a less
serious violation of minimal distance constraints are not attested in English (e.g.
/kn/). Since MIN-DIS constraints are in a fixed order e.g. MIN-DIS =1 >> MIN-DIS = 2
>> MIN-DIS=3 >> MIN-DIS=4, etc., the violation of one of the constraints in the fixed
ranking implies violation of the lower ranking constraints as well.17 Holding s-
stop sequences to be complex onsets would seem to require independent
constraints to rule out several clusters such as obstruent-nasal (e.g. pn), stop
17 See DeLacy (2002) for an approach to scales using stringency constraints.
27
fricative (e.g. ps) and stop-stop (e.g. pt) that are phonotactically impossible in
word-initial position.
An alternative proposal regarding word initial s-stop clusters is that rather
than making up a complex onset, they consist of an adjunct /s/ followed by the
simple stop onset (Borowsky, 1986; Davis, 1990; Kaye et al, 1990).18 There are
different claims made as to the status of /sC/ clusters in general: whether all s-
initial clusters contain an extrasyllabic /s/, or only those in which sonority
sequencing is violated.
A constraint-based analysis of adjuncts in a child’s phonological grammar
will be given in the following chapter; I note here only that regardless of whether
initial s-stop clusters violate the SSP or *ADJUNCT, they are typically considered
the marked cluster type when compared to initial stop-approximant clusters in
English. This fact may result in differences in rate of acquisition between these
two word-initial cluster types.19 20
18 Extraprosodic elements are claimed to exist in word-final position as well; these explain
sonority plateaus, as in /pt/ - ‘apt’, in addition to sonority reversals (e.g. ps, ‘lapse’) at word end.
19 See Morelli (2003) for an argument for why s-stop clusters, compared to stop-s, stop-stop and
fricative-fricative clusters, are actually unmarked. In addition, Hall (2002) argues that rather than
considering s-stop clusters to be exceptional on account of the extrasyllabicity of the initial
consonant, the SSP should pertain only to clusters consisting of obstruent and sonorants, rather
than two obstruents. In other words, prohibited would be a cluster in which a sonorant preceded
an obstruent in word-initial position or followed an obstruent in word final position.
20 Another account of the special status of s-stop clusters is that rather than being complex onsets,
they are complex segments (e.g. Selkirk, 1982).
28
2.3.5 Syllable contact
SYLLABLE CONTACT constraints represent yet another manifestation of the
sonority-driven preference for CV syllables. These constraints evaluate syllable
contours, comparing the relative sonority of the end of one syllable with the
beginning of the next.
(13) SYLLABLE CONTACT (Gouskova, 2004; Hooper, 1976; Kirk, 2001; Murray
& Vennemann, 1983).
Sonority must fall between coda and onset of adjacent syllables
One example of the activity of SYLLABLE CONTACT is illustrated in the process of
epenthesis in English loan words in Hindi (Gouskova, 2004): in s-stop clusters,
the vowel is inserted in initial position (e.g. [wskul] ‘school’), while epenthesis
occurs between the two consonants in the case of clusters in which sonority rises
(e.g. [fwrut] ‘fruit’). The claim is that the default site for epenthesis is initial
position, under the influence of CONTIGUITY.21
Epenthesis occurs in a different
location in obstruent-liquid clusters, because word-initial epenthesis would
result in a fatal violation of SYLLABLE CONTACT: *[wf.rut].
21 IO-CONTIGUITY requires two segments that are contiguous in the input to be contiguous in the
output.
29

Lc. [fwrut] *
d. [wf.rut] *!
Given the use of epenthesis to break up clusters in English loan words, we can
assume that DEP is ranked below *COMPLEX and MAX in Hindi. These rankings
are not given in the tableau above, which illustrates, simply, the rankings needed
to derive the asymmetrical position of epenthesis. IO-CONTIGUITY demands that
vowels be epenthesized at the edge of the cluster, rather than into it (16a over
16b); however, the satisfaction of this constraint is sacrificed only when SYLLABLE
CONTACT is at stake, (14c over 14d).
An example of SYLLABLE CONTACT in syllabification in adult languages is
given by Morelli (2003) for Italian: while s-stop clusters are heterosyllabic by
*COMPLEX >> NO CODA, the ranking of SYLLABLE-CONTACT above *COMPLEX, results
in stop-liquid clusters being complex onsets, as below.
(15) SYLLABLE-CONTACT >> *COMPLEX >> NOCODA
/vespc/ SYLLABLE-CONTACT *COMPLEX
La. ves.pc
b. ve.spc *!
/wglu/ SYLLABLE-CONTACT *COMPLEX
Lc. w.glu *
d. wg.lu *!
30
The activity of SYLLABLE CONTACT is consistent with results from psycholinguistic
experimental research as well. For example, in a syllabification task, Treiman &
Zukowski (1990) found that s-stop clusters were more likely to be split between
two syllables than stop-liquid clusters. This suggests either that s-stops are
worse onsets than stop-liquids or that a stop-liquid sequence is a worse
heterosyllabic cluster than an s-stop sequence, or both.
A final crosslinguistic example of SYLLABLE CONTACT comes from Yakut
(Baertsch, 2002), in which there are no medial clusters in which sonority rises
from C1 to C2. Medial clusters are assumed to be heterosyllabic since clusters are
not permissible in word-initial position. Furthermore, when words containing
intervocalic clusters are borrowed from Russian into Yakut, an epenthetic vowel
is inserted between C1 and C2 when there is a sonority rise between the two
consonants. This is similar to the example for Hindi in (16).
As in the case of sonority MARGIN and MINIMAL DISTANCE constraints,
SYLLABLE CONTACT constraints are argued to be in a fixed ranking, such as the one
given below:
(16)..*DIS3 >> *DIS2>>*DIS1 >> *DIS0 >> *DIS-1 >> *DIS-2 >> etc. (Gouskova, 2004)
Each of the constraints listed in the ranking above specifies the minimal sonority
difference necessary between the coda of the first syllable and the onset of the
second. For example, for a heterosyllabic cluster /dl/, assuming /d/ has 1 degree
31
of sonority and /l/ has 3, the sonority difference is -2. This cluster thus violates
*DIS-1 and everything below it.
Baertsch (2002) proposes a unification of the various sonority constraints
highlighted so far. The basic constraints are those regulating simple margins, M1
for onsets and M2 for codas. The constraints on sequences (i.e. SSP/MINIMAL
DISTANCE, SYLLABLE-CONTACT) are represented as conjoined constraints, where
M2 represents not only a syllable coda, but the second member of an onset
sequence as well. This proposal is attractive because it uses one set of constraints
and the mechanism of constraint conjunction to derive related phenomena, all of
which converge on the ideal syllable (=CV) or sonority profile. A comparison of
Baertsch's approach to the one described previously is beyond the scope of this
work. For the purpose of this thesis, I will maintain the traditional (separate) sets
of constraints, as detailed above.
The role that SYLLABLE CONTACT is expected to play in children’s
acquisition of medial clusters is straightforward when the intervocalic clusters
are unambiguously heterosyllabic. Since SYLLABLE CONTACT prefers those
clusters in which C1 is maximally sonorous and C2 is minimally sonorous, nasal-
stop clusters, for example, are predicted to emerge prior to fricative-stop or
nasal-fricative clusters.
32
2.4 Syllable weight constraints
Unlike sonority constraints, these markedness constraints are oblivious to the
segmental features of the consonants contained in syllables. Instead, they restrict
the form of a syllable by specifying the maximum or minimum weight it can
contain. It is commonly assumed that heavy syllables contain at minimum two
morae, while light syllables are monomoraic. In English, a heavy syllable
consists of either a long (tense or diphthong) vowel or a closed syllable (vowel +
coda). A light syllable is by definition an open syllable since consonants carry
weight in English (high ranking of WEIGHT-BY-POSITION). The constraints that are
of potential interest from the standpoint of cluster acquisition are defined below.
(17) STRESS-TO-WEIGHT: Stressed σs are heavy.
Gouskova (2003); Hayes (1995); Kager (1999)
(18) *TRIMORAIC-σ: No trimoraic σs Kager (1999)
STRESS-TO-WEIGHT may result in vowels being lengthened in open stressed
syllables (e.g. Hayes, 1995; Gouskova, 2003). *TRIMORAIC-σ militates against long
vowels and weight-bearing codas occupying the same syllable. Closed syllable
shortening is evidence of this constraint (e.g. Kager, 1999).
These constraints can be relevant to the syllabification of intervocalic
consonant clusters, as attested to by psycholinguistic experimental results
showing that clusters are divided across 2 syllables more often when the
preceding stressed syllable is lax than when it is tense (e.g. Treiman & Zukowski,
33
1990). An example of a constraint ranking that would produce such an
asymmetry is given below.22
(19) STRESS-TO-WEIGHT >> NOCODA >> *COMPLEX
/V[lax]CCV/ STRESS-TO-WEIGHT NOCODA *COMPLEX
La. [V[lax]C.CV] *
b. [V[lax].CCV] *! *
/V[tense]CCV/ STRESS-TO-WEIGHT NOCODA *COMPLEX
c. [V[tense]C.CV] *!
Ld. [V[tense].CCV] *
Since both complex onsets and codas are permitted in English, we assume that
both markedness constraints are ranked below FAITH. Therefore, in the
syllabification of an intervocalic cluster, FAITH plays no role, while the relative
ranking between NOCODA and *COMPLEX may determine in which syllable C1 is
placed. The ranking of NOCODA above *COMPLEX results in onset maximization
(19d) in the default case (when the preceding stressed vowel is tense). However,
the ranking of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT above NOCODA results in C1 being drawn into
the preceding syllable in the case in which the vowel is lax in order to avoid a
light stressed syllable.
No claim is made in (19) as to the correct ranking among such constraints
in adult English. The tableau only illustrates how an asymmetry in
syllabification preferences can be arrived at through the activity of the constraint
22 *TRIMORAIC-σ will also result in the same predicted asymmetry between post-lax and post-tense
environments; however, it makes no prediction about the difference between the post-lax and
post-unstressed contexts.
34
STRESS-TO-WEIGHT. Important in this regard is that there is no ranking of
constraints that will produce the opposite asymmetry: one in which intervocalic
clusters are parsed into two different syllables more often after tense vowels than
after lax vowels.
In acquisition, STRESS-TO-WEIGHT thus predicts that clusters will be
produced more faithfully on the whole following lax stressed vowels than
following tense stressed vowels and unstressed syllables. This is because, even
in stages in which intervocalic clusters are generally avoided, STRESS-TO-WEIGHT
can force their faithful production, given the right prosodic environment (i.e.,
following a stressed syllable containing a lax vowel). Such a prediction will be
elaborated on in subsequent chapters.
Furthermore, when cluster reduction takes place, STRESS-TO-WEIGHT may
cause the intervocalic /C/ to be a coda (or ambisyllabic). The contribution of the
MARGIN constraints (*ONSET-FRICATIVE, *CODA-STOP, etc.) may then determine
which of the two consonants gets selected in the output. For example, given an
s-stop cluster, the fact that the more sonorous consonants are preferred as codas
(i.e. fricatives over stops) and that an intervocalic consonant is more likely to be a
coda when the previous syllable is lax and stressed than when it is tense and
stressed, predicts that /s/ will be retained more often following a stressed syllable
35
containing a lax vowel than following a stressed syllable containing a tense
vowel.
2.5 Positional faithfulness
2.5.1 Introduction
Positional Faithfulness (Beckman, 1998) accounts for a varied array of phonological
phenomena involving prominent positions within words. Such positions are
claimed to be privileged (for psycholinguistic or phonetic reasons) by virtue of
their being host to contrasts that are neutralized elsewhere, or triggering or
resisting processes that apply elsewhere (e.g. Beckman, 1998; Casali, 1997; Smith,
2002). Examples of positions of privilege include root-initial syllables (as
opposed to medial ones), stressed syllables (as opposed to unstressed syllables),
and syllable onsets (as opposed to syllable codas) (Beckman, 1998).
Regarding the acquisition of complex onsets, I am interested in the role
that MAX-σ[INITIAL] and MAX-σ[HEAD] may play in determining where complex onsets
emerge first. Both of these constraints have been proposed for adult
phonologies, and I thus expect them to play a role in rate of cluster acquisition
among children as well. Examples of two sets of constraints at work are given
below.
36
2.5.2 MAX-σ
σ
σ
σ[INITIAL]
In Tamil (example from Beckman, 1998), complex codas are absent, except in the
root-initial syllable. General MAX ranked below *COMPLEX[CODA] accounts for the
general failure of complex codas to appear in most positions of the word. Their
appearance in initial syllables is a consequence of the higher ranking of the
following constraint:
(20) MAX-σ[INITIAL] (Beckman, 1998)
Every element of the input has a correspondent in the root-initial syllable of the
output
Since syllable structure is typically assumed to be absent in the input, this
constraint does NOT require every element of the initial syllable in the input to
be present in the output. Instead, it reflects a preference for every root segment
of the input to surface in the initial syllable of the output. Since the size and
shape of syllables is constrained by a larger set of markedness constraints, in
most cases this constraint is violated to some degree. However, precisely since
violations are gradient (in the sense that one violation mark is earned for each
segment in the input that is lost in the output), the more segments can be
squeezed into the initial syllable, the better the output candidate is. A tableau of
the suggested rankings representing this grammar is given below (Beckman,
1998).
37
(21) MAX-σ[INITIAL] >> *COMPLEX[CODA] >> DEP
/˘aaïkkay/ MAX-σ[INITIAL] *COMPLEX[CODA] DEP
La. [˘aaïk.k±] ** *
b. [˘aa.ï}k.k±] ***!** *
/kat∞±‰mpa/ MAX-σ[INITIAL] *COMPLEX[CODA] DEP
Lc.[ka.t∞±‰}m.pa] ****** *
d. [ka.t∞±‰m.pa] ****** *!
Above we see that complex codas are generally disallowed in Tamil (ranking of
*COMPLEX[CODA] above DEP), except for in initial syllables (ranking of MAX-σ[INITIAL]
above *COMPLEX[CODA]).
As far as complex onsets are concerned, greater permissiveness in word-
initial position compared to medial position could be viewed as an argument for
initial segment extraprosodicity. That is, what appears to be an onset cluster in
initial position could be argued to be a singleton onset preceded by a syllable
adjunct. While such an analysis works for complex onsets, it is difficult to see
how it could account for the phenomenon illustrated in (21) involving the
presence of complex codas in initial syllables only. On the other hand, MAX-
σ[INITIAL] will result in clusters (either onset or coda) appearing sometimes in word
initial syllables alone.
The prediction regarding cluster acquisition is that some children will
acquire initial onset clusters before medial ones. This is under the assumptions
that (1) they may promote (position) specific faithfulness constraints before
38
general ones, and (2) there is no specific faithfulness constraint that targets non-
initial position. This paradigm is the reverse of the one discussed in 2.2 (absence
of initial CC; presence of medial CC). However, the opposite asymmetry was
predicted on the basis of the cluster in the medial environment not being an
onset at all. In the experiment testing positional faithfulness I strive to
distinguish between these two opposite predictions through manipulations that
maximize the possibility of medial clusters being tautosyllabic (i.e. complex
onsets) rather than heterosyllabic. The next section is devoted to exposition of
another privileged environment: that of the stressed syllable.
2.5.3 MAX-σ
σ
σ
σ[HEAD]
Another position of prominence is the main foot or stressed syllable of the word.
The corresponding positional faithfulness constraint is defined in (22).
(22) MAX-σ[HEAD]: every element of the input has a correspondent in the stressed
syllable of the output (Beckman, 1998).
With regard to consonant clusters, Goad & Rose (2004) give evidence from
Brazilian Portuguese of a dialect in which onset clusters are present only in
stressed syllables. They argue that this is evidence in support of full
prosodification of inputs in adult grammars, given the definition of their
constraint: MAX-σ[HEAD]. However, Beckman’s (1998) constraint, defined in (23),
may do the same work. That said, I illustrate the interaction in (23) using Goad
& Rose’s (2004) constraints, since the data come from their paper.

2.6 Conclusion
This chapter has provided basic definitions of the constraints in question, as well
as a brief examination of how they can restrict the presence of consonant clusters
in a language’s inventory to various sequences in particular prosodic positions.
As discussed in Chapter 1, certain assumptions regarding phonological
acquisition (i.e. the nature of the initial state and the process through which
acquisition takes place) make possible the connections between crosslinguistic
phonology and stages of phonological acquisition. In the chapter that follows I
review the work that has been done on the acquisition of clusters and describe in
detail the questions I wish to address in this thesis.

CHAPTER 3
CLUSTER ACQUISITION LITERATURE
3.1 Introduction
This chapter reviews some of the extant research in the area of consonant cluster
acquisition with regard to both the order in which clusters are acquired and the
repairs chosen (i.e. reduction preferences). Specifically, I highlight results of
previous studies that can be brought to bear on some of the constraints discussed
in Chapter 2, including SONORITY SEQUENCING, *ADJUNCT, and sonority MARGIN
constraints. While most research pertains to the development of clusters in
word-initial position, there have been a few studies of intervocalic clusters as
well. The chapter is divided into two sections, the first one dealing with order of
acquisition and the second with cluster reduction. Each of these sections is
further organized according to word position: initial followed by medial;
findings regarding the effect of prosody (e.g. stress) will be discussed where
relevant.
By the conclusion of the chapter, I intend to have motivated the research
undertaken in this thesis, designed to enrich or fill gaps in our knowledge of the
activity of the previously discussed constraints in guiding children’s acquisition
of consonant clusters.
41
3.2 Order of acquisition
3.2.1 Introduction
By order of acquisition I intend the relative markedness of one cluster (with
reference either to segmental sequence, position or both) compared to another.
Conclusions in this regard are sometimes made on the basis of a calculated
comparison between the percentage of correct productions of the two different
clusters at one moment in time or across a determined span of time.
Alternatively, given access to longitudinal data, criterion numbers (or
percentages) of correct pronunciations are sought for each cluster of interest; the
age at which that criterion is met is then interpreted as the age in which a
structure is acquired. In this way, the timing of the acquisition of two or more
different structures can be compared. The way in which precedence relations in
the acquisition of diverse clusters or other structures of interest are established
hinges to some extent on the type of methodology used. The studies I review
include different investigative procedures in addition to diverse means for
establishing when a cluster is “acquired.”
42
3.2.2 Initial clusters
3.2.2.1 General trends: /sC/ + obstruent-approximant clusters
This section summarizes some basic findings with regard to the acquisition of
word-initial obstruent-approximant and /sC/ clusters. It has been suggested (e.g.
Bernhardt & Stemberger, 1998; Fikkert, 1994; Nordstrom, 2002) that the effects of
SONORITY SEQUENCING and MINIMAL DISTANCE constraints in phonological
acquisition are reflected in the order in which specific clusters are acquired in
word-initial position. The prediction is that children will acquire earlier those in
which the sonority distance between the two consonants is maximized (e.g. stop-
liquid/stop-glide), rather than those in which a sonority plateau or reversal
occurs (e.g. s-stop) (Fikkert, 1994). Most studies of English and other Germanic
languages have shown that in general, children acquire word-initial stop-
approximant clusters before word-initial sC clusters (Barlow, 2001; Beers, 1995;
Bernhardt & Stemberger, 1998; Fikkert, 1994; Ingram, 1989; McLeod et al, 2001a;
McLeod et al, 2001b, Templin, 1957).
43
While this pattern is consistent with the Sonority Hypothesis,23 24
it is not without
exception. The earlier production of s-stop clusters, for example, with respect to
stop-liquid clusters, has been attested as well (e.g. Barlow, 1997/ 2001 for English;
Fikkert, 1994 for Dutch).25
One explanation for this reversal is that the /s/ of s-
stop clusters (and arguably that of all /sC/ clusters) is an adjunct in several
languages (e.g. Barlow, 2001; Fikkert, 1994), and since the cluster is not wholly
contained in the onset, *COMPLEX is not violated. Therefore, a child who
produces s-stop clusters but not stop-approximant clusters ranks *COMPLEX
above FAITH and the constraint against adjuncts below FAITH. I begin with an
overview of some normative studies pertaining to developmental trends in
word-initial cluster acquisition. Afterwards I review some recent analyses
relevant to the earlier acquisition of /sC/ clusters by some children.
23
Furthermore, Bernhardt & Stemberger (1998) present data from children who metathesize
initial s-stop clusters (e.g. /sp/ → [ps]); this repair may also be indicative of the role of SONORITY
SEQUENCING in cluster development, since [sp] represents a sonority drop across the onset, while
[ps] constitutes a rise, assuming stops and fricatives to belong to different sonority classes.
24 Bernhardt & Stemberger (1998) also argue for the existence of further constraints and relevant
rankings that give preference to stop-approximant clusters over s-stop clusters. One example is
the ranking of the sequence constraint *[+CONTINUANT][-CONTINUANT] above *[-CONTINUANT]
[+CONTINUANT]. As made explicit in the previous chapter, the predictions made by sonority are
position dependent, in so far as they rely on the domain of the syllable and syllabification of a
cluster in medial position may differ from that in initial position. Sequence constraints, on the
other hand, target particular sequences of consonants, without regard to syllabic affiliation.
25 A difference between Barlow (2001) and Fikkert (1994) and is that for the children in the latter
study, the s-stop clusters patterned differently from other /sC/ clusters, whereas in Barlow (2001),
all /sC/ clusters patterned together in the grammar of one child. These studies are discussed in
3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.4.
44
Templin (1957) studied word production in 60 children between the ages
of 3 and 8. An elicitation procedure was used to collect data, with younger
children identifying pictures or repeating words and older children reading or
repeating words. Among the reported findings for cluster acquisition was that
by age 4, most word-initial clusters had been acquired, with the exception of
three-member clusters (e.g. str) and those containing a fricative and liquid (e.g.
/sl/, /fl/).
Smit (1993) collected data on word-initial cluster production among 1049
children from the ages of 3 to 9. These data included those from the Iowa-
Nebraska Articulation Norms Project (Smit et al, 1990) in addition to data from
2.0 and 2.6 age groups collected at a later date. In both studies an elicitation
procedure was used. One finding was that cluster reduction persisted longer for
/sC/ clusters than for obstruent-approximant clusters. For example, at the 2-3
year age range, stop-liquid clusters were reduced 45-50% of the time, and s-stop
clusters were reduced at a rate of 60-65%. At the age of 3,5 cluster reduction was
still in the range of 5-15% for /sC/ clusters but in the “occasional” range for /tw/,
/kw/, /Cl/ and /Cr/ clusters.
McLeod et al (2001a) conducted a longitudinal (=6 month) study of
spontaneous speech in 16 children starting from age 2;0-2;11. With regard to
word-initial clusters, the authors conclude that there is no uniform tendency
45
towards the earlier acquisition of clusters beginning with stops compared to
those beginning with fricatives. Instead, they cite evidence for significant inter-
child variation characterizing developmental orders.
In the following section I describe in detail three longitudinal case studies
that provide descriptions in addition to analyses of individual grammars in
which /sC/ clusters precede stop-liquid clusters in acquisition.
3.2.2.2 Barlow (2001)
Barlow’s (2001) case study involves a child who is not only producing s-stop
clusters faithfully while reducing obstruent-approximant clusters, but is
producing all sC clusters, including s-liquid and s-glide clusters. Barlow
accounts for this inventory through the assumption that word initial /sC/
sequences contain an extraprosodic element, /s/. This element is referred to as an
adjunct. And the markedness constraint violated by such a structure is defined
in (1) below:
(1) *ADJUNCT: adjuncts are prohibited (Barlow, 2001)
If *COMPLEX outranks FAITH, which in turn outranks *ADJUNCT, then only /sC/
clusters are allowed in the grammar. The intermediate grammar suggested by
her subject’s stage 2 is given below.26
26 In stage 1, all clusters are reduced, including /s/ clusters; in stage 3 all clusters are produced in a
target-like fashion.
46
(2) *COMPLEX >> FAITH >> *ADJUNCT
/brV/ *COMPLEX FAITH *ADJUNCT
a. [brV] *!
Lb. [bV] *
/sCV/ *COMPLEX FAITH *ADJUNCT
Lc. [s.CV] *
d. [CV] *!
e. [sCV] *!
The grammar in (2) contains only initial /sC/ clusters because *ADJUNCT is ranked
beneath FAITH, while *COMPLEX is inviolable. Furthermore, /s/ is the only
consonant allowed to be a left adjunct by a set of inviolable constraints regarding
permissible adjuncts (Barlow, 2001).
While Barlow (2001) uses a permutation of the three constraints:
*ADJUNCT, FAITH and *COMPLEX to derive a typology of languages allowing
particular patterns of word-initial consonant sequences: (a) only adjuncts, (b)
only complex onsets, (c) both, or (d) neither, she does not include the constraint
ranking representing an intermediate stage of a child who acquires obstruent-
approximant clusters before s-stop clusters. In a stage in which core (e.g.
obstruent-approximant) clusters are produced, FAITH must outrank *COMPLEX.
The ranking of *ADJUNCT over FAITH means that adjunct-initial sequences are
prohibited. But that constraint by itself does not rule out word-initial s-stop
clusters. Something like SSP is still necessary to prevent s-stop clusters from
emerging as complex onsets even though they are prevented from being adjuncts
47
by the high ranking of *ADJUNCT. The tableau in (3) illustrates a possible
intermediate stage of a child who is producing obstruent-approximant clusters,
but has yet to acquire s-stop clusters.
(3) *ADJUNCT >> FAITH >> *COMPLEX
/brV/ *ADJUNCT SSP FAITH *COMPLEX
La.[brV] *
b. [bV] *!
/sCV/ *ADJUNCT SSP FAITH *COMPLEX
c. [s.CV] *!
Ld. [CV] *
e. [sCV] *! *
The grammar of the child in (3) permits most clusters because *COMPLEX has been
demoted below FAITH. Complex onsets made up of /s/ followed by a stop are not
allowed, however, because they violate sonority sequencing (SSP) in addition to
*ADJUNCT. SSP is necessary to explain the asymmetry (=presence of stop-liquid
clusters/absence of s-stop clusters) because s-stop clusters have the option of
being complex onsets, just like stop-liquid clusters.
For Barlow (2001)’s subject who acquired obstruent-approximant clusters
later than s-clusters, all /sC/ clusters patterned together, regardless of whether C2
was a liquid, nasal, or glide. However given the opposite order of acquisition
(obstruent-approximant clusters first) as shown in (3), it is not clear with which
group s-sonorant clusters would be expected to pattern. If they pattern with s-
stop clusters in this case as well, then we need a high-ranking markedness
48
constraint besides *ADJUNCT and SSP that is violated by s-sonorant clusters, but
not by other obstruent-sonorant clusters (e.g. [sl] vs. [fl]). Otherwise, s-sonorant
clusters should be realized as complex onsets, alongside other obstruent-
approximant clusters in English. One explanation for the markedness of all /sC/
clusters compared to obstruent-approximant clusters is derived not by one
markedness constraint, but by constraint interaction, as proposed by Nordstrom
(2002).
3.2.2.3 Nordstrom (2002)
Nordstrom compares the acquisition of /sC/ clusters with that of obstruent-
approximant clusters in English using child speech corpora of longitudinal
naturalistic data (from Compton & Streeter, 1977; Nordstrom, 2002). He finds
evidence of variation across children. One child has obstruent-approximant
clusters, but no s-clusters of any kind. *ADJUNCT along with SSP will rule out s-
stop clusters; however, the problem, as discussed in 3.1.1.2, is how to rule out s-
liquid and s-glide clusters, for example, when other obstruent-liquid/glide
clusters are produced faithfully. Nordstrom proposes a new constraint,
S=ADJUNCT that requires preconsonantal /s/ to be an adjunct. As long as
*ADJUNCT and S=ADJUNCT are ranked above FAITH, /sC/ clusters of all kinds are
predicted to be reduced. Constraint rankings that derive the multiple orders
(and patterns) of acquisition reviewed so far are provided below, given the
49
addition of this new constraint. Each tableau represents a different grammar and
is described according to which types of clusters are present.

We have now seen several ways in which all /sC/ clusters pattern together in
acquisition and the constraint rankings that support such patterns. First, /sC/
clusters of all types can precede (as a group) obstruent-approximant clusters in
acquisition when /s/ is an adjunct and *COMPLEX is ranked above FAITH. Second,
/sC/ clusters as a class can undergo a lag in acquisition on account of the high
ranking of both *ADJUNCT and S=ADJUNCT, relative to FAITH. Third, only s-stop
clusters can lag behind obstruent-sonorant clusters (including s-sonorants), on
account of the high ranking of SSP and *ADJUNCT. There exists yet another
attested possibility: the earlier acquisition of s-stop clusters only. Evidence in
support of the differential acquisition of s-stop clusters vs other s-clusters has
been found for, among others, children acquiring Dutch. In this study (Fikkert,
27 In this grammar the position occupied by SSP and S=ADJUNCT in the hierarchy are indeterminate
and of no consequence; for this reason, they are not included in the tableau.
51
1994), s-sonorant clusters pattern with obstruent-sonorant clusters, both in the
children who acquire obstruent-sonorant clusters first (the more common
pattern, as in English) and in the children who acquire s-stop clusters first.
3.2.2.4 Fikkert (1994)
In this study naturalistic data were collected over a span of approximately one
year for twelve Dutch speaking children between the ages of twelve and thirty-
one months. The resulting observations regarding acquisition of word-initial
consonant clusters can be summed up as follows. Although most of the children
acquired obstruent-sonorant clusters before s-stop clusters, this pattern was
reversed in the speech of two children. These children produced s-stop clusters
faithfully toward the end of their enrollment in the study, while still deleting the
sonorant of stop-sonorant clusters and s-sonorant clusters.
Fikkert (1994) accounts for these patterns using a parameters approach. In
the initial stage of acquisition, parameters are set to universal defaults based on
markedness; acquisition is manifested in the resetting of the parameters (when
necessary) to those that are active in the adult grammar. In the case of word-
initial clusters, one parameter applies to the number of consonants in syllable
onsets (#onset/C/ > 1) set to NO in an initial stage), while the other concerns the
allowance of adjuncts (set to NO initially as well). Children who acquire
obstruent-sonorant clusters first have reset the COMPLEX ONSET parameter to YES,
52
since clusters exist in Dutch; however, s-obstruent clusters are disallowed
because the ADJUNCT parameter is set to NO and because as complex onsets, they
violate SONORITY SEQUENCING, which is held to be an inviolable principle, not a
parameter. On the other hand, children who produce s-obstruent clusters, but
not obstruent-sonorant clusters have COMPLEX ONSET set to NO, while they have
already reset the ADJUNCT parameter to YES. Since /s/ is the only consonant
allowed to be an adjunct, obstruent-sonorant clusters are not admitted by the
positive setting of this parameter.
Table 3. Parameter settings and resulting cluster grammars (Fikkert, 1994).
PARAMETERS
Cluster grammars
ONSET CLUSTERS LEFT-EDGE
ADJUNCTS
a. Obs-son only Yes No
b. s-stop only No Yes
c. No clusters No No
d. All clusters Yes Yes
An important issue raised by Fikkert’s analysis of onset cluster asymmetries has
to do with the patterning of /sC/ clusters. Fikkert claims that s-sonorant clusters
pattern with other obstruent-sonorant clusters, rather than with s-obstruent
clusters. And she prohibits them from being adjuncts by stipulating within the
adjunct parameter that the only initial /sC/ clusters permitted as adjuncts are
those sequences that would otherwise violate sonority sequencing. Such an
adult grammar can be achieved straightforwardly through a particular ranking
of constraints, as can the grammar (reflected in Barlow, 2001) in which all /sC/
53
clusters contain initial adjuncts. The determining factor is the ranking between
*ADJUNCT and *COMPLEX. The relevant tableaux are given in (7) and (8). No
difference in inventories can be ascertained on the basis of these two tableaux;
the differences are purely representational.
(7) Hypothetical adult grammar: (only s-stop clusters involve adjuncts)
SSP, FAITH >> *ADJUNCT >> *COMPLEX
/spa/ SSP FAITH *ADJUNCT *COMPLEX
a. .spa *! *
Lb. s.pa *
c. pa *!
/sla/ SSP FAITH *ADJUNCT *COMPLEX

(8) Hypothetical adult grammar (all sC clusters involve adjuncts)
SSP, FAITH >> *COMPLEX >> *ADJUNCT
/spa/ SSP FAITH *COMPLEX *ADJUNCT
a. .spa *! *
Lb. s.pa *
c. pa *!
/sla/ SSP FAITH *COMPLEX *ADJUNCT
d. sla *!
Le. s.la *
f. sa *!
In adult English, assuming that left-edge /s/ adjuncts exist, both *ADJUNCT and
*COMPLEX are ranked below FAITH. Whether s-sonorant clusters are adjunct
initial or complex onset clusters depends on the ranking between *ADJUNCT and
54
*COMPLEX. Furthermore, regardless of how s-sonorant clusters pattern, s-stop
clusters will be adjunct-initial in order to avoid violation of high-ranked SSP.
Returning to an examination of acquisition stages, we find that Fikkert’s
attested intermediate stage, in which s-stop clusters are present but s-sonorant
clusters (along with other obstruent-sonorant clusters) absent, is impossible to
derive with a permutation of the present constraints. The fact that obstruent-
sonorant clusters are absent is an indication that *COMPLEX is ranked above
FAITH, and the fact that s-stop clusters are present means FAITH is ranked above
*ADJUNCT. As argued by Barlow (2001), we can prevent consonants other than /s/
from being adjuncts through the high ranking of other markedness constraints;
however, if /s/ is an adjunct to a following stop-initial onset, /s/-initial (adjunct)
clusters of all sorts should be allowed.
There is no obvious way to capture this intermediate stage using the basic
constraints proposed by Barlow (2001) and Nordstrom (2002). And Fikkert’s
(1994) parameter approach, as described above, cannot be imported in any easy
way into a constraint-ranking paradigm. Before outlining alternative solutions, I
review constraint-derived intermediate stages of cluster acquisition that have
been identified in the literature and discussed in detail in this chapter.

The typology in Table 4 represents 8 potential patterns of cluster production
involving stop-liquid clusters, s-liquid clusters and s-stop clusters, on the basis of
which clusters are present and which are absent. For each possible combination
we see a compatible ranking on the basis of constraints proposed so far.
One pattern, (e), relies crucially on the S=ADJUNCT constraint proposed by
Nordstrom (2002); three other combinations are not derivable by permutations of
the constraints above: (f) – (h). Two out of those three, (g) and (h), have not been
attested in child phonology to my knowledge. A stage that has been attested but
not yet accounted for through constraint ranking is the one possessed by two of
Fikkert’s children, in which the only clusters present are s-stop clusters (f).
Because /s/ is allowed to be an adjunct for s-stop clusters, it should be allowed to
be an adjunct for all /sC/ clusters. Because only s-stop clusters emerge faithfully,
we must assume that another constraint militates against s-sonorant clusters. In
56
the paragraph that follows, I suggest possible constraints/constraint rankings
that would produce such a pattern.
One solution is to invoke a conjoined constraint28 such as the following:
[*ADJUNCT][*LIQUID] or [*ADJUNCT][*LIQUID-ONS]. The intuition is that since both
adjuncts and liquids (or liquid onsets) are marked, having both of them in the
word-initial cluster is particularly undesirable. If high enough ranked, this
constraint would prohibit an adjunct-initial sequence containing a liquid
(analogous constraints would have to target nasals and glides, respectively). The
implication is then that s-stop clusters can emerge earlier than other sC clusters
on the basis of obstruents being favored over sonorants as syllable margins. The
problem with this proposal is that it isn’t clear what the domain of the conjoined
constraint would be.29
If the /s/ lies outside of the syllable, restricting the domain
of application to the syllable or subconstituent thereof does not work. If the
domain is specified as something larger (a foot or the prosodic word, for
example), it would, in effect, prohibit not only initial /sl/ sequences, for example,
but also words containing an initial adjunct AND a non-adjacent liquid (e.g. spwl
‘spill’). This seems not quite right.
28 See Smolensky (1995) for constraint conjunction and Levelt & van de Vijver (2004) for use of
conjoined constraints in acquisition.
29 On domain-specific conjoined constraints, see Smolensky (2005).
57
A second possibility is that SYLLABLE CONTACT constraints hold between a
syllable edge and any other segment, even if the contiguous segment is not a
member of an adjoining syllable, but an adjunct (see Jongstra, 2003, for what
seems to be an assumption along such lines). In this case, s-stop clusters would
be permitted because there is a fall in sonority between /s/ and the left edge of
the following syllable. In the case of /s/ followed by a liquid, glide or nasal, there
is a rise in sonority, which violates SYLLABLE-CONTACT. If SYLLABLE-CONTACT
limits /sC/ clusters to those containing stops word initially, we expect to find a
similar pattern word medially. However, if clusters are permitted medially that
violate SYLLABLE CONTACT, (e.g. Vs.wV) but disallowed initially (e.g. *#sw), then
SYLLABLE-CONTACT by itself is insufficient and we are forced to appeal to another
conjoined constraint (e.g. *[ADJUNCT][SYLLABLE CONTACT]).
3.2.2.5 Word-initial cluster production: Summary and questions
While there is evidence from several surveys of cluster acquisition that the earlier
word-initial clusters to be acquired tend to be those in which sonority distance is
maximized (e.g. stop-approximants), this finding is not uniform across children.
Other orders have been identified as well, for example, the earlier acquisition of
s-stop clusters with respect to obstruent-approximant clusters. This has been
argued to constitute evidence for a different structural status for word-initial s-
clusters. Rather than being complex onsets, they are assumed to consist of a
58
single onset consonant preceded by an extraprosodic element, or left-edge
adjunct. There is little consensus on whether all /sC/ clusters should contain
adjuncts, or only those that violate SONORITY SEQUENCING as complex onsets, s-
stops. I have demonstrated the difficulty in deriving a stage in which only s-stop
clusters are present through the application of the standard constraints
suggested in previous analyses. I've suggested other potential constraints – most
likely in the form of constraint conjunction - that could account for such an
attested stage.
On account of the variation that is attested across children, we might ask
why one order is more frequent if both orders are permitted simply by
differential constraint rankings. The answer to such a question requires no doubt
a particular theory of learning, in which a more frequent order of acquisition is
driven by the greater frequency of particular structures in the ambient (i.e. adult)
language (see, for example, Boermsa, 1997; Boersma & Levelt, 2000). The fact
that a few children still acquire clusters in the reverse (marked) order may be
evidence simply of a certain amount of variation in the frequency with which
individual children are exposed to words of various structures or the frequency
that certain structures represent in the active lexicons of different children. This
issue will be addressed in brief with regard to experimental results in 5.1.4.
59
3.2.3 Medial cluster acquisition
There exists substantially less documentation with regard to the order in which
medial clusters are acquired. Bernhardt & Stemberger (1998) note that nasal-stop
clusters are among the first medial clusters to be acquired in children’s speech.
This trend may be consistent with the role played by SYLLABLE CONTACT, which
requires a sonority drop between the end of one syllable and the beginning of the
next; furthermore, the bigger the drop, the better.
Barlow (2003) examines medial cluster production in three children
acquiring Spanish. She accounts for the common emergence of some
heterosyllabic clusters before tautosyllabic clusters by means of syllable structure
constraints. A subject’s failure to produce a tautosyllabic (word-initial) cluster is
due to the ranking of *COMPLEX over FAITH. Her realization of a word medial
cluster is therefore a product of FAITH outranking NOCODA. A second child has
the opposite pattern: word-initial clusters but no word medial clusters. Barlow
(2003) analyzes this pattern as due to the ranking NOCODA >> FAITH >> *COMPLEX;
however, she points out that the problem with such an assumption is that word-
final codas are already present in the child’s grammar. In the end, she analyzes
these word-final codas as onsets to the following syllables, which explains the
presence of word-final consonants, without forcing an assumption of violability
60
of NOCODA.30
Omitted from her analysis are /sC/ clusters, which she notes are
problematic in so far as their syllable structure is ambiguous.
Medial s-stop clusters are examined by Stockman & Stephenson (1981),
who study the production of medial consonant clusters corresponding to legal
and illegal word initial clusters in the speech of normally developing children,
aged 4 to 8. They predict that the intervocalic clusters corresponding to legal
word-initial clusters (e.g. bi[st]ab) will be more accurately produced than those
corresponding to illegal word-initial sequences (e.g. bi[ts]ab). Among the legal
word-initial clusters used, error rates between initial and intervocalic position
were also compared. In the case of legal onset clusters (=sC), there were more
errors in word-initial position than in word-medial position. While *COMPLEX or
SSP/SONORITY DISTANCE constraints could lead to deletion word initially, when the
/sC/ cluster occurs between two vowels, the heterosyllabification of the /s/ and
/C/ is possible, and therefore, is likely to account for the drop in error rate.31
Stockman & Stephenson (1981) doesn’t report individual rates in accuracy
of production of other clusters. It would be interesting to see error rates broken
30 Words were likely to have been uttered in isolation or in sentence-final position by the children,
based on the description of the procedure used.
31 The results also indicated more errors on the word-initial impossible sequences, when appearing
intervocalically (e.g. ts) than on the possible ones (=st). It is hard to say whether sonority played a
role, as the possible sequences contained both rising sonority (e.g. sl) and falling sonority (e.g. st)
profiles; likewise, the impossible sequences contained both sonority profiles (e.g. ts and ms).
61
down according to type of cluster: /sp/, /sl/, /sm/, etc. While sonority distance
constraints would prefer /sl/ over /sm/ over /sp/ word initially, the opposite
order would be predicted medially by SYLLABLE-CONTACT constraints, assuming
heterosyllabification of the medial /sC/. One of the experiments carried out in
this dissertation is designed precisely to address potential differential acquisition
of medial /sC/ clusters, according to manner of articulation of C2.
Finally, Ohala (2004) tested 2-3 year olds on a variety of medial clusters in
differing prosodic conditions.32 She found that clusters occurring in strong-strong
contexts (i.e. between two stressed vowels) were produced more often than in a
strong-weak (following a stressed syllable and preceding an unstressed syllable)
or weak-strong (following a unstressed syllable; preceding a stressed syllable)
context. Furthermore, between the latter two categories, clusters were produced
faithfully more often in the strong-weak condition than in the weak-strong
condition. This latter finding could be interpreted as evidence for a constraint
pertaining to syllable weight, such as STRESS-TO-WEIGHT, as suggested below.33
32 Medial clusters included: /s/-stop, /z/-nasal, fricative-nasal, nasal-fricative, liquid-stop, liquid-
nasal, liquid-fricative, and fricative-liquid. No discussion is available regarding an effect of
cluster type on the tendency of clusters of different types to be reduced, although it is apparent
from graphs that there is an interaction between stress and cluster type in percentage of
reductions which occur.
33 In both conditions in which the first syllable was stressed (SW and SS), the vowel used was lax.
62
(9) STRESS-TO-WEIGHT >> *CC >> FAITH
/VCCVC’/ STRESS-TO-WEIGHT *CC34 FAITH
La. [V.CVC’] *
b. [VC.CVC’] *!
/VlaxC’CV/ STRESS-TO-WEIGHT *CC FAITH
Lc. [VlaxC’.CV] *
d. [Vlax’.CV] *! *
The ranking shown above is one in which a cluster will be retained in the SW
context, as long as the vowel in the stressed syllable is short. In effect, there are
two constraints that select the faithful output representation: FAITH and STRESS-
TO-WEIGHT. In the WS context, on the other hand, the only constraint that selects
the faithful representation is FAITH. Assuming the medial cluster to be
heterosyllabic (as they are, on the whole in Ohala’s (2004) study), there is no
alternative ranking of constraints that would cause a cluster to appear faithfully
following an unstressed syllable, but not following a stressed syllable. Therefore,
the fact that the SW condition in Ohala’s (2004) study resulted in more faithful
reproductions than the WS condition could be viewed as a direct consequence of
STRESS-TO-WEIGHT.
As is evident from the studies above, medial clusters have received some
attention in the literature on cluster acquisition; however, there have been few
direct references to roles played by the prosodic markedness constraints
34 This abbreviation is used here for any constraint against a heterosyllabic cluster, such as
NOCODA or SYLLABLE-CONTACT.
63
discussed in this dissertation. For example, SYLLABLE-CONTACT constraints
predict that heterosyllabic clusters containing a sonority rise will be acquired
later than those containing a sonority fall. Furthermore, under the influence of
the constraints STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and *TRIMORAIC-σ, intervocalic (heterosyllabic)
clusters should be produced more faithfully following stressed lax vowels than
following stressed tense vowels and unstressed vowels.
The cases discussed in the preceding paragraph regarded heterosyllabic
clusters. When the clusters are onsets, on the other hand, positional faithfulness
constraints may result in these clusters being acquired earlier in initial syllables
than in non-initial syllables and earlier in stressed syllables than in unstressed
syllables. In support of this prediction, Rose (2000) documented a stage in which
a child acquiring French produced clusters in stressed syllables, but not in
unstressed syllables (e.g. /gËo/ → [gËo] 'big' vs. /t≈uvé/ → [k¨∫í] ‘tractor’). These
predictions will be summarized at chapter end. I now turn to a review of
research into cluster reduction.
64
3.3 Reduction
3.3.1 Introduction
The most common repair for illicit clusters in first language acquisition is
reduction, that is, deletion of one of the two (or more) consonants.35
Evidence
from a vast range of studies has shown that the selection of one or the other
consonant is not random within a child’s grammar, although inter-child
variation sometimes occurs (see, especially, Jongstra, 2003). Common patterns of
reduction are driven by independently motivated universal constraints.
3.3.2 Margin hierarchy to account for word-edge reduction
Sonority has been found to be an important factor in the determination of which
consonant is preserved when clusters are reduced (e.g. Barlow, 1997; Fikkert,
1994; Gierut, 1999; Gnanadesikan, 2004; Ingram, 1989; Jongstra, 2003; Ohala,
1996; Ohala, 1999; Pater & Barlow, 2003). For example, in initial position,
children tend to preserve C1 in obstruent-liquid clusters and C2 in s-stop clusters, in
both cases selecting the less sonorous of the pair (e.g. Ohala, 1996; Pater &
Barlow, 2003).36 This outcome is consistent with the cross-linguistic preference
given to onsets of low sonority, which is captured by the fixed ranking of
35 Interestingly, adults learning a second language tend to employ the opposite strategy: that of
epenthesis.
36 Other constraints shown to play a role in onset selection include IO-CONT (van der Pas, 2004),
FAITH-LAB, *DORSAL and *FRICATIVE (Jongstra, 2003; Pater & Barlow, 2003).
65
constraints (Pater, 1997; Pater & Barlow, 2003; Prince & Smolensky, 1993/2004),
given in (10).
(10) *ONSET-GLIDE >> *ONSET-LIQUID >> *ONSET-NASAL >> *ONSET-FRICATIVE
While the constraint ranking above does not itself drive reduction, it determines
which consonant is retained from the cluster, as shown below.
(11) *COMPLEX >> FAITH >> *ONS-GLIDE >> *ONS-LIQ >> *ONS-NAS >> *ONS-FRIC
/blu/ *COMPLEX FAITH *ONS-GLIDE *ONS-LIQ *ONS-NAS *ONS-FRIC
a. [blu] *! *
Lb. [bu] *
c. [lu] * *!
In (11) the ranking of *COMPLEX over FAITH is responsible for reduction (and,
thus, the elimination of candidate 11a); the presence of *ONSET-LIQUID is, on the
other hand, assumed to be the factor behind the retention of the stop (11b), rather
than the liquid (11c), in onset position.37
3.3.3 Patterns of medial cluster reduction
As discussed in the previous chapter, a common assumption is that intervocalic
singleton consonants are syllabified as onsets, rather than as codas, resulting
from the constraints ONSET and NOCODA, both of which disprefer a [VC.V]
sequence (Prince & Smolensky, 1993/2004; Stemberger, 1996). However, in some
37 While obstruent-approximant clusters and s-stop clusters appear to behave relatively
consistently with regard to reduction patterns (as noted above), s-sonorant clusters have been
noted to be less homogenous with regard to consonant selection facts. For example, while s-stop
clusters almost always reduce to the stop, s-nasal clusters may reduce to either the stop or the
nasal. For various accounts of these facts, see Goad & Rose, 2004; Jongstra, 2003; Pater & Barlow,
2003.
66
languages such as English, when the preceding syllable is stressed, a single
intervocalic consonant is often argued to be a coda or ambisyllabic
(e.g Gussenhoven, 1986; Kahn; 1976; Kirk, 2001; Pulgram, 1970; Selkirk, 1982).38
If the intervocalic consonant is a coda, then it is evaluated not by the
constraint ranking in (11), but by the fixed ranking in effect for the opposite
syllable margin. This ranking, presented in the previous chapter, appears in (12)
below. It reflects a cross-linguistic preference for codas that are high in sonority.
(12) *CODA-STOP >> *CODA-FRICATIVE >> *CODA-NASAL >> *CODA-LIQUID
If the intervocalic consonant is neither exclusively a coda nor exclusively an
onset, then the interaction of *CODA-C constraints and *ONSET-C constraints
may determine which consonant gets preserved.39
While variation is likely to
exist within and across children with regard to syllabification of the medial
consonant, we should see an effect of stress on medial preservation patterns.
Ohala (1996, 1999) conducted an experimental study of cluster production
in two positions: word-initial and word-final position. Word-initial clusters
included fricative-stop (e.g. sp), fricative-nasal (e.g. sn), stop-glide (e.g. kw)
clusters, etc., while word-final clusters included s-stop (e.g. sk) and nasal-stop
(e.g. mp) clusters, among others. Results showed evidence for the influence of
38 In Gussenhoven (1986)'s account of ambisyllabicity, based on the environments in which
flapping occurs, an intervocalic consonant is ambisyllabic also between two unstressed syllables.
39 This context for reduction will be addressed further in 3.3.
67
sonority on consonant selection: in word-initial position, the least sonorous
consonant (e.g. the stop from s-stop clusters and stop-approximant clusters)
tended to be preserved, while in word-final position, the more sonorous
consonant (e.g. the fricative from fricative-stop clusters) was preserved.
These findings were argued to be evidence for the Margin Hierarchy.40
Ohala (1998) tested intervocalic clusters in different prosodic contexts
within disyllabic words (i.e. SW, WS, SS). She found no effect of prosody on the
choice of consonant to preserve, but a significant effect of sonority. Similar to the
findings of her 1996 study on word initial clusters, it was the least sonorous of
the consonants that was most often retained. An interaction of relative sonority
with neither cluster type (e.g. s-stop, stop-glide, nasal-stop) nor prosodic
condition (i.e. SW, WS, SS) was observed.
On the basis of these results, Ohala (1998) concludes that even when the
cluster is preceded by a stressed syllable and followed by an unstressed one, the
40 Not all clusters followed the expected patterns of reduction. For example, final nasal-stop
clusters were most often reduced to the stop, rather than the nasal. Ohala (1996) explains this
result as a product of such final sequences not being perceived as consonant clusters at all.
Instead, she claims, children hear these as sequences of nasalized vowels followed by a stop
consonant. Furthermore, results from an experiment involving non-native initial clusters
revealed that typically C2 was preserved, independent of the relative sonority of the two
consonants. This result was explained as a tendency for children to perceive these clusters as
containing an epenthesized vowel between the two consonants and to then omit the initial
unstressed syllable containing C1. For example, words containing initial /tfV/ sequences would
be assigned the input structure: /tcfV/, and would be produced as [fV], given the process of initial
unstressed syllable deletion which characterizes the speech of many children of this age.
68
intervocalic consonant is produced as an onset, not a coda, conforming thus to
the ideal CV syllable shape.
One issue not considered in this analysis is the potential for
ambisyllabicity of a singleton intervocalic consonant following a stressed
syllable. While Ohala (1998) concedes in a footnote that such a structure is
possible, she does not investigate its consequences as, she notes, the implications
for sonority are much less clear.
3.4 Objectives of thesis
3.4.1 Introduction
The basic objective of the thesis is to determine to what extent we find evidence
in cluster acquisition stages for a set of predicted positional and segmental
asymmetries derived from interactions among several categories of constraints.
Precisely because the constraints examined in this thesis all require reference to
the syllable as a prosodic constituent, the context of the cluster in question is
predicted to matter. In many cases, the effect of cluster type will be expected to
interact with position. For example, the prediction that stop-liquid clusters will
be produced more faithfully than s-stop clusters is confined to word-initial
position, for in intervocalic position, the cluster may be heterosyllabic. To
recapitulate, the following constraints are invoked in the hypothesis testing that
follows:
69
(13) Constraints tested for
A. syllable structure: NOCODA, *COMPLEX
B. sonority: SSP, SYLLABLE CONTACT, ONSET hierarchy constraints
C. stress & syllable weight: STRESS-TO-WEIGHT, *TRIMORIAC-σ
D. positional faithfulness: MAX-σ[INITIAL], MAX-σ[HEAD]
In the following sections, I summarize the specific questions to be pursued,
according to constraint category and asymmetry type.
3.4.2 Syllable structure
The existence of syllable structure constraints (e.g. NOCODA, ONSET, *COMPLEX)
predicts positional asymmetries in the acquisition of clusters, specifically
differences between word-initial and word-medial positions. For example,
medial clusters that are also possible word-initial clusters may precede their
word initial counterparts in acquisition. Especially given the fact that children
acquiring English often acquire codas before complex onsets, a heterosyllabic
cluster may emerge even if the same cluster is usually produced as an onset in
word-initial position in adult English.
70
3.4.3 Sonority
Constraints pertaining to sonority are reviewed below:
Table 5. Sonority constraints.
Constraint violated by:
SONORITY SEQUENCING (SSP) onset clusters in which sonority falls between C1 & C2;
coda clusters in which sonority rises between C1 & C2
MINIMAL DISTANCE
(MIN-DIS)
onset clusters in which there is less than a certain
(minimal) rise in sonority between C1 and C2.
SYLLABLE CONTACT
(SYLL-CON)
a heterosyllabic cluster in which sonority rises between
the coda of first syllable and the onset of the second
*ONSET-C; *CODA-C, C=stop, fric,
nasal etc.
e.g. *ONSET-FRICATIVE by a fricative in onset position;
e.g. *CODA-FRICATIVE by a fricative in coda position.
With regard to the relative markedness of two consonants in a cluster, we predict
an interaction between cluster type and word position in the case of clusters that
occur in both initial and medial positions in English. In word-initial position,
stop-liquids are predicted to be acquired before s-stops, while this asymmetry
should vanish or be reversed in word-medial position, given the potential for a
word-medial cluster to be heterosyllabic, particularly when the syllable
preceding the cluster is stressed.
As far as heterosyllabic medial clusters are concerned, those that contain a
drop in sonority between C1 and C2 are expected to be acquired before those
containing an increase in sonority between C1 and C2. This prediction follows
from SYLLABLE CONTACT.
71
3.4.4 Prosody
With regard to order of acquisition, clusters will be acquired following stressed
syllables with lax vowels before they are acquired following stressed syllables
with tense vowels (STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and *TRIMORAIC-σ) or following unstressed
syllables (STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and WEIGHT-TO-STRESS).
With regard to cluster reduction, we predict an interaction of STRESS-TO-
WEIGHT and WEIGHT-TO-STRESS with the sonority constraints discussed
previously. Assuming that an intervocalic singleton consonant is sometimes a
coda, the more sonorous of the two consonants will be retained in that case,
while when it is an onset the less sonorous of the two will be favored. This
should result in a higher percentage of selections of the more sonorous
consonant in the lax[stressed] condition than in the tense[stressed] and the
unstressed condition.
3.4.5 Positional faithfulness
Positional faithfulness constraints, by definition, result in positional (contextual)
asymmetries in so far as order of acquisition and reduction patterns are
concerned. In terms of preservation choices during stages in which segmental
deletion occurs, we expect a stage in which edge segments (initial or final or
72
both) are retained, while other members are deleted.41
Furthermore, assuming
special faithfulness to heads of feet in child speech (Goad & Rose, 2004; Rose,
2000), preservation patterns are predicted to follow at times from stress
placement. For example, in a medial /CC/ cluster that is potentially
heterosyllabic, the first of the two consonants is more likely to be preserved if the
initial syllable is stressed than if it is unstressed. With regard to the order in
which onset clusters are acquired, a stage is predicted in which a particular
cluster is correctly produced in initial position before medial position.
The experiments conducted in this dissertation are designed to test the
various predictions outlined above. However, first, I devote a chapter to the
review of a search I performed on a child speech corpus, the results of which
bear on some of the questions posed above.
41 This is the opposite result from that dictated by another faithfulness constraint - CONTIGUITY,
for which some evidence has been found in child phonology (see fn. 36).
73
CHAPTER 4
RESULTS OF A CHILD SPEECH CORPORA SEARCH
4.1 Introduction
This chapter serves to set the stage for the experiments undertaken in the
dissertation, the results of which are reported in subsequent chapters. It is based
on results of searches of child speech corpora that I conducted prior to initiating
the experimental research. The corpora contain data from Compton & Streeter
(1977) that were compiled by Pater (1997). The database consists of spontaneous
utterances from five children followed over an extended period of time (one to
two years), with data recorded in diary style, in most cases at least four times a
week. All children were monolingual English speakers. None were known to
have speech delays. The age ranges (or dates) for which data were available for
each child are given below:
Table 6. Children and age ranges during data collection (from Compton &
Streeter, 1977).

Sean 1;1.27 3;2.21
42 Ages at which transcriptions began and ended were not available for Michael or Renee;
therefore, dates are provided instead.
74
Transcriptions of these children’s speech were performed by parents, speech
pathologists who had received special training in transcribing child speech prior
to the onset of the project (details from Pater, 1997). No recordings were
available.
4.2 How the search was performed
For the research reported in Pater (1997), the original transcripts of the child
utterances were put into computer readable format, and separate spreadsheets
were created for each child. I performed several searches of these data files using
FileMaker Pro. This program permits the search of a particular field for a
specified sequence of characters. Since I was particularly interested in
comparisons among clusters across different positions, I conducted searches in
word-initial, word-medial, and in some cases, word-final position. I searched the
field gloss, which consists of standard English orthography. The output from the
search contains all lines of speech (including phonetic transcription) that possess
the sequence specified (e.g. the input, e.g. #sp). I then imported the results into
Excel, and from there compiled data for each child for each cluster in every
position. I coded the responses first for faithful production of cluster vs.
unfaithful production (2 vs. 1, respectively). Then, in all cases in which deletion
occurred, I specified the consonant that was retained. Clusters containing more
than two consonants were not included in these counts.
75
4.3 Predictions
I was interested in ascertaining from the spontaneous speech data information
about which classes of clusters appear to be less marked in child productions on
the basis of being acquired earlier or being produced correctly more consistently.
The clusters that were sufficiently represented in these data samples and of
relevance to the positional (i.e. initial vs. medial) asymmetries I was interested in
were all initial clusters and medial s-stop clusters. Predictions are presented
schematically in Table 7.
Table 7. Predictions regarding degree of faithful production of clusters in
corpora study.

consonant clusters (e.g. s-stop vs. stop-s, for example) or among clusters in
different prosodic contexts (e.g. preceding a stressed syllable vs. following a
stressed syllable) there were not enough tokens from these classes to make such
comparisons feasible. These were thus left to the experiments that follow.
The other interest was in studying trends regarding consonant selection in
different positions of the word (that is, which consonant is retained when cluster
reduction occurs). The simplest prediction here was an interaction between
76
consonant selection and word position. On the basis of the sonority hypothesis
that in onsets, less sonorous consonants are preferred while in codas more
sonorous codas are preferred, I predicted that in a cluster that occurs in all three
positions of the word (= s-stop), the preference for the stop over the /s/ that has
been attested in word-initial position would be somewhat diminished in
intervocalic position (on the basis of an intervocalic consonant sometimes being
syllabified as a coda), and even more diminished in word-final position, on the
basis of it always being a coda. In following, I will describe the procedure used
and the findings for each of these queries, separately.
4.4 Order of acquisition
The observations made in this section pertain to the extent to which clusters were
realized faithfully across type and position. Faithfully produced clusters were
classified as those in which no deletion, metathesis nor change in manner
features occurred.
As noted previously, there are different ways to assess which clusters are
less marked or produced more faithfully within a single child’s grammar or
across children. One approach is to evaluate the order in which these clusters are
acquired by defining a criterion level of performance that a child must reach on a
particular cluster before describing it as being acquired (e.g. McLeod, 2001a). It
then becomes possible to list the order in which clusters of different types (and
77
potentially in different positions) are acquired; however, a separate timeline is
necessary for each individual child. The other way of comparing acquisition of
clusters – according to segmental or positional differences – is to perform
calculations consisting of the proportion of each cluster that is produced
correctly across an entire set of data. In this latter case, counts could potentially
be done on an individual basis or across children.
In assessing cluster performance among children from Compton &
Streeter (1977), I opted for the second method because there were not enough
data for each individual child in the corpora to permit all comparisons of interest
on a child-by-child basis. While one child in particular (Trevor) had a substantial
number of tokens for each cluster type/position for each month examined,
rendering possible an assessment of a longitudinal nature, other children had
gaps in which tokens containing clusters of particular types (or in a particular
position) were not attempted at all. By presenting results as measured by
percentage of correct production of cluster over an extended period of time,
generalizations across children as to the greater markedness of one cluster type
with respect to another were easier to make.
Since the main research carried out in this dissertation is experimental,
presenting the results of the corpus search in terms of percentage of overall
correct production of cluster is consistent with the presentation/analysis of
78
results adopted in subsequent chapters. Furthermore, my main intention in this
chapter is to present patterns that I gleaned from these corpora searches as
questions to test experimentally, rather than as results that stand alone.
4.4.1 Results: initial s-stop vs. obstruent-approximant clusters
Here I compare the rates of faithful production of initial s-stop clusters to those
of initial obstruent-approximant clusters, calculated separately for each child in
the corpus.43 Because data first appeared for some of the children at a very
young age (< 1 year), and for others closer to two years, I decided to begin the
counts at about the time in which clusters generally began to appear. For three
of the children, this stage began at approximately age 1;8 or 1;9. For the other
two children, the total amount of data was limited, so my counts were based on
the entire data set. Obstruent-approximant clusters included stop-approximant
clusters and /fl/, /fr/ clusters. Clusters containing /s/ followed by a consonant
other than a stop are excluded from this first comparison.
43 Clusters in which a liquid was realized as a glide were considered faithful for the purposes of
this comparison.

Calculating averages across all five children, it is evident that obstruent-
approximant clusters are favored on the whole over s-stop clusters. This is
shown in the graph below.

44 This child was not producing lateral liquids at all for the duration of data collection. While /r/
often became a glide, /l/ was consistently deleted when part of a cluster (as a singleton, /l/ was
usually realized as the glide /j/). When percentage of faithful obstruent-liquid clusters included the
/r/ alone, faithfulness rose to 80%.

These results from spontaneous speech point to the relative markedness of initial
s-stop clusters compared to obstruent-approximant clusters in child productions.
In the previous chapter, I discussed the question as to whether all /sC/
clusters are adjunct initial, or only those that violate SONORITY SEQUENCING, i.e. s-
stop clusters. While word-initial s-sonorant clusters are not as frequent as word-
initial s-stop clusters in the corpora data, I took counts for these as well as a
means of comparing relative markedness of one type of /sC/ cluster with that of
another.
4.4.2 /sC/ clusters
I once again recorded counts of faithfully produced s-clusters for each of four
cluster types: s-stop, s-nasal, s-liquid, and s-glide. These are reported below for
each child, followed by a graph in which averages are taken across children per
cluster.45

Figure 2. Percentage of faithful realization of /s/-stop clusters according to

The differences in faithful production of word-initial /sC/ clusters averaged
across children are not huge. Neither do the individual data show any strong
tendencies to prefer one cluster type over another, although /sw/ clusters appear
to have an edge over the other clusters within and across children. The sole clear
(dis)preference for a particular cluster type emerges in the data of Julia: she
produces very few /sl/ clusters. However, this outcome alone is not indicative of
the greater relative markedness of s-liquid clusters compared to other /sC/
clusters. This child appears to delete /l/ systematically from all clusters (e.g. /pl/,
82
/kl/, etc.). Furthermore, when /l/ occurs as a singleton onset in the target word, it
is usually substituted with /j/ . Since /sj/ represents an illicit onset cluster in
American English, it is not surprising that deletion is the chosen repair in the
case of a cluster containing /l/. As far as the rest of the children are concerned,
there is relative consistency in performance across the range of /sC/ clusters: the
children who perform well on s-stop clusters appear to perform nearly as well on
the other clusters; those who delete s-stop clusters in initial position tend to do
the same with /sC/ clusters of other types.
4.4.3 Initial vs. medial position: s-stop clusters
The observations here pertain to the realization of s-stop clusters in initial vs.
medial position. The percentages per individual subject for the children from the
Compton & Streeter (1977) study are given below.
Table 10. Percentage of faithful realization of initial vs. medial s-stop clusters
in corpora.

Sean 47% (311/499) 52% (14/27) 1;8-3;2
Two out of the five children simply attempt no words with word-medial stop
clusters. Therefore, no comparisons can be made in these cases. The other three
children all pronounce word-medial sC clusters with a higher degree of overall
accuracy than their word-initial counterparts; averages across the three children
83
possessing data from clusters in both environments are represented in the figure
below.
Figure 3. Percentage of faithful realization of initial vs. medial /s/-stop clusters.
The prediction as to the greater markedness of initial s-stop clusters compared to
medial s-stop clusters is confirmed by the corpora counts performed here,
although the differences are not as great as one might expect. I assume, as
explained previously, that medial s-stop clusters may precede initial s-stop
clusters because they are often heterosyllabic word medially.

clusters: s-stop. These clusters are unique in that they occur in initial, medial
AND final position of the word, resulting in greater potential for observations
regarding positional asymmetries in preservation preferences with respect to
other word-initial clusters.
4.5.1 Positional asymmetries in reduction of s-stop clusters
Clusters containing s-stop sequences are useful to examine for positional
asymmetries in so far as they are found in initial, medial, and final position in the
word. Margin constraints (*ONSET-FRICATIVE, *CODA-STOP, etc.) predict a
difference in the tendency to retain the /s/ over the stop, depending on the part of
the syllable which the consonant is associated to. When a word-initial consonant
is reduced, the consonant retained will be an onset, and when a word-final
cluster is reduced, the remaining consonant will be a coda. Finally, in word-
medial position following a stressed vowel, an intervocalic consonant may be a
coda or ambisyllabic if STRESS-TO-WEIGHT or STRESS-ATTRACTS is high enough
ranked. Otherwise, the consonant will be an onset by ONSET and NOCODA.
Therefore, the more sonorous of the two consonants is predicted to emerge most
often in final position, as a coda, next in medial position where it is presumably a
coda some of the time, and least often in word-initial position where it should be
exclusively an onset. The results from the corpora analysis (based on raw counts
averaged across all 5 children) are displayed in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Percentage of /s/ retention in word- initial, medial, and final position.
As is evident from the numbers above, there is a predictable divide between the
choice of which consonant to retain on the basis of position in the word. In initial
position, the stop is chosen consistently over the fricative; in medial position the
fricative is chosen nearly half of the time over the stop, while in word-final
position, the fricative is chosen over the stop in the vast majority of the cases.
On the one hand, the asymmetry between initial and final position is
reflective of the one found in Ohala (1996). Following her claim, this asymmetry
is due to the onset-coda asymmetry, with low sonority consonants favored as
86
onsets and high sonority consonants favored as codas. The fact that the
percentage of /s/ retention in intervocalic position is somewhere between those
for word edges could be indicative of the variability of syllabification of the
intervocalic consonant – as an onset or a coda – in the child’s speech.
4.6 Conclusions
The counts taken from the child speech corpora lend support to particular
predictions regarding cluster-type and positional asymmetries. First, with
regard to the relative markedness of one cluster compared to another (where
both segmental differences and positional differences are considered), I found
that word-initial obstruent-approximant clusters are produced with greater
overall accuracy than s-stop clusters. This pattern holds in the data from 4/5
children. This supports, in part, the notion of sonority constraints to the extent
that stop-approximant clusters constitute a large sonority distance between C1
and C2. However, SONORITY SEQUENCING/MINIMAL DISTANCE constraints also
predict a difference in acquisition rates between various representatives of /sC/
clusters, a difference that does not emerge clearly from this data, although some
variation exists among children. Perhaps this is evidence that /sC/ clusters of all
types are treated as adjunct initial. Finally, the fact that s-stop clusters were
produced faithfully more often intervocalically than word initially is evidence
that they are often heterosyllabic in medial position. The possibility that
87
heterosyllabic clusters precede tautosyllabic sequences in acquisition is rendered
possible by the activity of different syllable structure constraints (e.g. *COMPLEX,
NOCODA, etc.). Furthermore, s-stop clusters in particular are likely to be
heterosyllabic intervocalically due to the markedness of a tautosyllabic (initial)
cluster that violates sonority sequencing.

CHAPTER 5
EXPERIMENT 1
SONORITY, STRESS, SYLLABLE WEIGHT: ACQUISITION ORDER AND
REDUCTION IN S-STOP AND STOP-LIQUID CLUSTERS
5.1 Introduction
The experiment described in this chapter was set up to test many aspects of
cluster development introduced in Chapters 2 and 3. Of primary interest was the
role of sonority constraints such as SSP and SYLLABLE CONTACT in predicting the
order of acquisition of different clusters relative to specific positions within the
word, i.e. initial and medial. Secondly, constraints on syllable weight and stress
were predicted to influence the order in which medial clusters in varying
prosodic contexts are acquired. As regards cluster reduction, both families of
constraints (sonority and stress-syllable weight) were tested for their effects on
consonant selection, which is expected to vary depending on word position and
prosodic context. Finally, I question whether faithfulness constraints may play a
role in consonant selection. In cases in which the consonants belong to different
syllables in the adult form, the one that is part of the stressed syllable may be
protected by a special kind of faithfulness constraint.
The clusters examined in this experiment are a subset of those possible in
word-initial position in English, and include s-stop and stop-liquid sequences,
both types of which occur in medial position as well. The experiment will be
89
discussed in two parts: Experiment 1a pertains to order of acquisition, while
Experiment 1b focuses on cluster reduction. Subjects and methodology are the
same.
5.2 Experiment 1a: Order of acquisition
5.2.1 Introduction and hypotheses
Given a set of universal markedness constraints that are based on the syllable or
a constituent thereof, we expect contextual asymmetries in acquisition order
(quantified as rate of faithful cluster production) to pattern in a way consistent
with interactions among those constraints. Hypotheses are put forth in terms of
potential asymmetries or preferences in order of acquisition.
Predicted asymmetries among children in the process of acquiring clusters
i. word position: some children will produce both members of a particular cluster
word medially, but not word initially
Prediction (i) emerges from syllable structure constraints such as NOCODA and
*COMPLEX. If *COMPLEX outranks FAITH, clusters are not allowed word initially. If
FAITH outranks NOCODA, a cluster is possible word medially as long as it is
heterosyllabic. This should hold even if the cluster is permitted word initially
(and thus held to be a complex onset) in the adult language. A grammar that
illustrates precisely this intermediate stage is given in (1).

e. [V.CV] *!
ii. interaction cluster type + position: in the absence of word-initial clusters and the
presence of some word-medial clusters, [sp] will be preferred to [br] word
medially.46
Prediction (ii) is based upon the family of SYLLABLE CONTACT constraints. A
heterosyllabic s-stop (sp) cluster fares better on SYLLABLE CONTACT than a
heterosyllabic stop-liquid cluster (br). Therefore, given a child with a grammar
resembling that in (1) in which the only intervocalic clusters allowed are
heterosyllabic ones (*COMPLEX >> FAITH >> NOCODA), we predict that in
intervocalic position, [sp] clusters will be produced faithfully more often than
[br] ones. This grammar is exemplified in (2).

46 [sp] is the abbreviation used for the class of s-stop clusters; [br] stands for stop-liquid clusters.
91
iii. prosody: clusters following stressed syllables containing lax vowels will be
produced faithfully more often than the same clusters following stressed
syllables containing tense vowels.
Prediction (iii) is a result of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT. This constraint can be satisfied
by a bimoraic (long) vowel or the presence of a coda. Therefore, we expect
clusters to be produced more consistently in the post-lax environment than in the
post-tense environment, since in the former environment STRESS-TO-WEIGHT in
addition to FAITH favors the candidate that possesses a cluster.47

The predictions discussed above involve comparisons along particular
dimensions. They are not intended to specify which intermediate constraint
rankings all children should possess at some point in time. The tableaux above
simply provide examples of constraint rankings that will produce asymmetrical
cluster behavior. Under the assumption that the opposite asymmetry in each
case is NOT predicted by any permutation of these or other constraints, it is
47 The other constraint preferring a stressed CVC with a lax V to the same syllable with a tense V
is *TRIMORAIC SYLLABLE (Kager, 1999).
48 *COMPLEX[ONSET] is assumed to be ranked above FAITH in this grammar.

possible to arrive at predictions relevant to average performance across different
cluster types and positions.
5.2.2 Methods
5.2.2.1 Subjects
The subjects were 32 children ranging in ages from 1;6 to 3;2 months. Average
age at the time of testing was 2;3. Eighteen children were tested in a daycare
setting and fourteen were interviewed in their homes with parents present.
None of the children had any known speech or hearing disorders. All of the
subjects were native English speakers.
5.2.2.2 Stimuli
Factors manipulated were cluster type (stop-liquid vs. s-stop) and word
environment (initial, post-lax(stressed)V, post-tense(stressed)V or post-
unstressedV). The stimuli were invented names, of two syllables in length. The
stop-liquid clusters used were /bl, br, pr, dr, and kl/. The s-stop clusters were /sk,
st, and sp/. In the case of clusters occurring in initial position, the vowels and
consonants that followed were not controlled for. However, when the clusters
were in medial position following stressed vowels, the vowels in the syllable
preceding the cluster were [w, e, i, and e] and second syllables ended in either /C,
o, i, or c/. In the cases in which the medial cluster followed an unstressed initial
syllable, the stressed syllable following the cluster ended in a tense vowel or a
93
consonant. There were a total of 8 stimuli for each condition, resulting in 64 total
stimuli. Examples are given in the table below:

5.2.2.3 Procedure
An informal pretest was performed on each potential subject in order to ensure
that the child was eligible for the study. The pretest consisted of testing the child
on the singleton consonants that made up the clusters examined in this
experiment, either as onsets or codas, depending on the position that they
occupy in the cluster tested for. Stimuli containing such consonants were
typically real words or common names; children were prompted to say the
words using, in most cases, a picture book. Only three subjects did not
pronounce consonants correctly as singletons and were, therefore, excluded from
further participation.49
Children were tested on one to four occasions. The criterion for when to
cease data collection for a child was when a minimum of 6 tokens had been
gathered for each condition (e.g. br-initial, where “br” represents stop-liquid
cluster). The duration anticipated for each session was approximately 20

count of subjects, which was provided in the previous section.
94
minutes. However, if the child lost interest before the end of the activity, he/she
was interviewed again at a later date and the data from the two days were
pooled. The materials consisted of 20-30 stuffed animals and picture cards.
There were two testing procedures used.
In the first activity, animals were taken out of a bag one by one, and
introduced by the experimenter. The child was instructed to say “hello X,” in
which X represented the name of the animal, as dictated by the experimenter.
After all the animals had been taken out of the bag, the child was told to put
them back in again, this time saying “bye-bye X,” where X was once again a
stimulus name assigned arbitrarily to the animal by the experimenter. Each
stimulus name was handwritten on an index card. Initially, cards were shuffled
so as to ensure a random ordering of names.
In the second activity the child was presented with pictures of people.
The instructions were to listen to the name given by the experimenter for each
person appearing in the pictures, repeat the name, and then put the picture card
in a box. The same process of stimuli randomization was performed for this
procedure, and the stimuli used were the same as those drawn upon in the
previous activity. The first procedure was introduced first for all children. The
second was taken up if the child was not tired after the first or if the first activity
didn't engage the child's attention sufficiently.
95
5.2.3 Results
The experimental sessions were recorded using a Sony MD-X-70 recorder and
were transcribed at least twice for accuracy by the experimenter. Cluster
responses were coded in the following way: realized faithfully or deleted.
Responses that could not be transcribed with confidence after 3 attempts (mostly
due to inaudibility of child’s utterances) were discarded.
Several criteria were deemed necessary to eliminate subjects from the
group data analyzed. First, subjects (=4) were left out who had been regularly
exposed to a 2nd language. Second, one subject was omitted who was suspected
of having a hearing disorder (observation on the part of the teacher). There were
2 children for whom insufficient data were collected because the children did not
want to participate or were out sick on too many occasions. Finally, because at
the time this experiment was run there was an aim to analyze individual
grammars, a subject who deleted both cluster types less than 20% of the time in
all environments was considered too advanced for participation, while a child
was considered not advanced enough for inclusion if deletion occurred more
than 80% of the time in both cluster types across all contexts. These subjects
were not included in the analysis because their speech was less likely to provide
clues as to asymmetries in cluster production: clusters were either all present
96
everywhere or not present anywhere. Fourteen children remained once subjects
were eliminated for the reasons given above.
For the purposes of this analysis, two categories were conflated: fully
faithful realization (e.g. /br/ = [br]) and nearly faithful realization of the clusters
(e.g. /br/ = [bw]). Gliding was common in many children’s speech, and
furthermore, often targeted simple liquid onsets as well.50
For each subject,
percentages of utterances in which faithful realization of the cluster occurred
were calculated according to cluster type (stop-liquid vs. s-stop) and context
(post-lax, post-tense, post-unstressed, and word-initial). Percentages were
calculated as the number of utterances of a certain type in which both consonants
in the cluster were produced divided by the total number of times in which a
word containing a sequence of a particular type was attempted.
The post-unstressed category was ultimately excluded from this analysis.
Initial unstressed syllable deletion occurred in the speech of more than two
thirds of the subjects analyzed. Thus, the disyllabic utterances with final-σ stress
(e.g. Sabrine) were often produced as monosyllabic (e.g. [bin] or [brin]). To have
included these productions in the post-unstressed category would not have been
50 Other errors occurred randomly and included metathesis (e.g. sp > ps), and voicing changes
(e.g. pr > br). These were coded as faithful as well since they were not deemed relevant for effects
sought, nor did they occur systematically in any child’s speech. For example, even though a
change from /sp/ to [ps] represents a change in the relative sonority contour between the
consonants, there is still an important sonority difference between the resulting cluster and the
stop-liquid cluster.
97
representative of that condition, insofar as they resemble the word-initial context
rather than a word-medial one. To have coded these as instances of the initial
condition would have made the difference in numbers of tokens between the
categories initial and post-unstressed quite large. In addition, word-initial
clusters resulting from truncation of initial unstressed syllables are quite
different from real word-initial clusters in terms of the position of the cluster in
the input.
The dependent variable was percentage of faithful realization of a specific
cluster by prosodic context. Once averages were obtained for each child, these
averages were averaged across children for each cluster type and context; these
results are represented in the graph below. The abbreviation “br” represents the
class of stop-liquids and “sp” represents the class of s-stops.

Figure 5. Percentage of faithful production of clusters across position, by type.
Figure 5 shows the prosodic asymmetries for both /br/ and /sp/ clusters: Clusters
are realized most often following the lax (stressed) vowel and least often in initial
position. A 2 x 3 (cluster type x prosodic context) within-subjects repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out. The main effect of
cluster type was not significant, F(1,13) = 0.691, p=.421, while the main effect of
prosody was highly significant, F(2,26)= 24.95, p < .001. There was also a
significant interaction of cluster type and prosody, F(2,26) = 8.85, p =.001.
Planned contrasts showed significant differences between initial and post-tense
conditions, F(1,13) = 17.81, p=.001 and between post-lax and post-tense
conditions, F(1,13)=14.43, p=.002. Furthermore, post-hoc comparisons between
prosodic conditions within a cluster class (by way of t-tests) revealed significant
99
differences for [sp]-postlax vs. [sp]-initial, t(13)=7.42, p <.001 and for [sp]-
posttense vs. [sp]-initial, t(13)= 4.69, p < .001.51

Figure 6 shows the cluster type asymmetry by position. Whereas /sp/ is favored
over /br/ in both medial conditions (differences not significant), the opposite is
the case for initial position. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons (=t-tests) between
stop-liquid and s-stop in each prosodic condition revealed a significant
difference (adjusting for type 1 error using the Bonferroni procedure) only for
initial position: br > sp, t(13)=3.826, p = .002. The absence of an overall main

effect of cluster type and the presence of a significant interaction between cluster
type and prosody is explained by the fact that the greater tendency to reduce one
cluster with respect to another was eliminated when the cluster’s position in the
word changed.
5.2.4 Discussion
Results from the analysis lead to the following observations and subsequent
conclusions regarding the roles of the constraints under question.
5.2.4.1 Initial vs. medial
The tendency for clusters to be produced more often in medial position than in
initial position is largely a product of the s-stop initial vs. medial asymmetry.
This amounts simply to evidence that clusters found in word-initial position are
not always complex onsets when they are found intervocalically. Indeed, they
are often heterosyllabic, especially in the case of s-stop clusters. In fact, this
result from child production is consistent with the findings of some
psycholinguistic experiments (e.g. Kirk, 2001; Treiman & Zukowski, 1990), that
clusters were treated as heterosyllabic more often following a stressed vowel
than an unstressed vowel and more often with s-stop clusters, than with stop-
liquid clusters.
101
5.2.4.2 Word-initial position: SONORITY SEQUENCING & *ADJUNCT
The results show a striking asymmetry of cluster type in word-initial position.
Between [sp] and [br], the former is produced much less reliably. While this is
evidence in favor of SSP, there have been reports of children acquiring initial
clusters in the opposite order (see discussion of Fikkert, 1994 and Barlow, 2001,
in Chapter 3). If both orders are, in fact, possible, then the current finding is not
the result of the mere existence of particular constraints (assuming, following
Barlow, 2001, the existence of *ADJUNCT). The two possible intermediate stages
are illustrated below:
(4) SSP, *ADJUNCT >> FAITH >> *COMPLEX

102
Given evidence (see Chapter 3) that some children acquire s-stop clusters before
other word-initial clusters, I assume (following, e.g. Barlow, 2001), the existence
of the constraint *ADJUNCT. If this constraint is ranked below FAITH, which is in
turn ranked below *COMPLEX, then we get a possible intermediate stage (5) in
which s-stop clusters, but not stop-liquid clusters are present word initially. The
alternative stage (4) is also captured by reversing the two rankings of the
markedness constraints with FAITH.
The fact that one order seems to be overwhelmingly preferred to the other on the
basis of these experimental results is not a direct consequence of phonological
constraints or possible constraint rankings. One explanation for the asymmetry
may be found in a comparison of the lexical frequency of these two types of
clusters. Assuming, following Boersma (1997), Boersma & Levelt (2000), Levelt
& van de Vijver (2004), and others, that the speed with which constraints are
demoted depends, at least in part, on the rate at which they are violated in the
ambient (i.e. adult) language, it may be possible to predict which markedness
constraint (e.g. *COMPLEX or *ADJUNCT) will typically get demoted first.
A search I performed of child-directed speech on selected CHILDES
corpora revealed a greater frequency of *COMPLEX violators (i.e. obstruent-
approximant clusters) than *ADJUNCT violators (i.e /sC/ clusters). Counts were
drawn from the following CHILDES corpora: MacWhinney (MacWhinney, 2000),
103
Bates (Carlson-Luden, 1979; Bates et al, 1988), and Bloom (Bloom, 1970). The
token frequency for obstruent-approximant clusters vs. /sC/ clusters in the
corpora examined was found to be 1380 vs. 908. While this ratio is based on a
limited amount of data, the /sC/ count represents the total of all word-initial /sC/
sequences, including those in which there is a sonority rise between C1 and C2.
This makes it, potentially, an overrepresentation of the number of words violated
by *ADJUNCT in English, depending on whether all /sC/ clusters are held to
contain adjuncts or not. Since my current experimental research does not
demand an assessment of varying learning paths, I leave this topic to future
research.
5.2.4.3 Intervocalic position and SYLLABLE CONTACT
In the intervocalic context, there is not a significant difference in the frequency of
deletion in [sp] and [br] clusters. If [br] and [sp] were both only syllabified as
onset clusters word medially, we would expect the same asymmetry found for
word-initial position - greater faithfulness of stop-liquid clusters than s-stop
clusters- to persist in medial position. The fact that it does not is indication that
/sp/ is more likely to be heterosyllabic in intervocalic position than is /br/. I
suggest that these findings are evidence for SYLLABLE CONTACT. Although there
is not a great drop in sonority between a fricative coda and adjacent stop onset,
104
there IS a substantial rise in sonority between a stop coda and following liquid
onset, making the latter a worse violator of SYLLABLE CONTACT.
5.2.4.4 Vowel quality: STRESS-TO-WEIGHT
Cluster reduction occurs less often following a stressed lax vowel than a tense
one, p < .002. STRESS-TO-WEIGHT can accommodate this result; since the constraint
on bimoracity in stressed syllables is satisfied by a tense vowel, there is no
pressure for a consonant to be drawn into the preceding syllable. However, in
the case of the lax vowel, the markedness constraint STRESS-TO-WEIGHT motivates
preservation of both members of the cluster (tableau (3) is repeated again in (6)
below).

To sum up, the results of the data analysis across children attest to the role of
sonority, stress, and syllable weight in predicting order of acquisition of
particular clusters, with cluster type, position and prosodic context as
independent variables. The next section focuses on results pertaining to
consonant selection in cluster reduction.
105
5.3 Cluster reduction
5.3.1 Introduction
As discussed in Chapter 3, there is a well-documented tendency towards
retaining the stop of both stop-liquid clusters and s-stop clusters, which is
consistent with a crosslinguistic preference for onsets that are low in sonority.
An intervocalic singleton consonant differs from a word-initial consonant, in that
it is potentially a coda to the previous syllable or ambisyllabic, especially if the
preceding syllable is stressed. Due to evidence from acquisition suggesting that
intervocalic consonants are sometimes treated as codas (e.g. Kehoe & Lleo, 2002;
Stemberger & Bernhardt, 2002), I test this prediction in part 2 of this experiment.
The subjects, stimuli and procedure of the experiment were outlined
previously. The original experiment was designed to compare overall
performance on clusters of different types and in different positions (order of
acquisition analysis). However, given the fact that deletion was a frequent repair,
there was data available that could be used to address the further issue of
consonant selection. The reduction analysis presented here deals not with the
percentage of clusters produced correctly, but rather with the rates at which C1
vs. C2 is preserved among the cases in which reduction occurred. Constraints
discussed in the previous section will be shown to bear on the choice of
consonant to retain from the intervocalic cluster.
106
5.3.2 Hypotheses (markedness)
Hypotheses regarding cluster reduction patterns are summarized below:
i. Given the possibility for an intervocalic consonant to be syllabified as a coda, it
is predicted that the more sonorous consonant (e.g. /s/ from s-stop clusters) will
be selected more often word medially than word initially (*CODA-STOP >> *CODA-
FRICATIVE; *ONSET-FRICATIVE). Note that the expectation is not that the more
sonorous consonant will be preserved more often than the less sonorous
consonant medially, only that it will be preserved more often in the medial
contexts than in the initial one.
ii. The existence of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT predicts that the intervocalic consonant will
be a coda more often following a stressed syllable containing a lax vowel than a
stressed syllable containing a tense vowel, or an unstressed syllable.
Considering, in addition, the coda constraints (e.g. *STOP-CODA), the /s/ from an s-
stop cluster is predicted to be retained more often in the post-lax condition than
in the post-tense and post-unstressed conditions.
5.3.3 Hypothesis (faithfulness)
An alternative hypothesis considered is that the choice of which consonant to
preserve depends on an aspect of the adult output, or input to the child’s
grammar: the order of the two consonants. If the syllable preceding the cluster is
stressed, and that cluster is potentially heterosyllabic, then there will be a
107
preference for preserving C1 over C2 since C1 is part of the stressed syllable in the
adult output. The opposite result is expected to ensue when stress occurs on the
syllable following the cluster. An elaboration of this hypothesis in terms of
constraints involved and representations in the child’s grammar will be given in
5.3.5.3.
5.3.4 Results - cluster reduction
5.3.4.1 S-stop clusters
Results are reported as percentages, that are calculated as the number of times in
which the consonant preserved was /s/ divided by the total number of utterances
in which reduction of the cluster took place. Therefore, if a child attempted a
cluster of a certain type ten times, but only reduced it four times, of which /s/
was selected only once, then /s/ preservation in that case would be calculated as
1/4= 25%. To be included in this analysis, subjects (among those who were not
excluded for reasons independent of task performance) had to have at least 3
exemplars of reduced clusters for each category (=initial, post-lax, post-tense).
Ten subjects met this criterion. As mentioned in the previous section, on account
of the large number of truncations, the post-unstressed category (e.g. 'scbrín')
was eliminated from the analysis.

5.3.5 Discussion
5.3.5.1 S-stop clusters
The fact that the cluster is reduced to the /s/ more often medially than initially
suggests that the intervocalic /C/ is sometimes a coda. The fixed ranking (*CODA-
STOP >> *CODA-FRICATIVE) accounts for the choice of /s/ over the stop. The
significant difference in 7(a) suggests that an intervocalic /C/ is more likely to be
a coda (or ambisyllabic) when the previous syllable is stressed and light. This
amounts to the activity of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and*CODA-STOP. However, the fact
that the /s/ is retained more often in the post-tense condition than in the initial
condition (7b) is not explainable by STRESS-TO-WEIGHT, since this constraint is
already satisfied by a long (hence, tense) vowel and is not a motivation for the
consonant being drawn into the previous syllable as a coda.
One way for explaining this difference is the principle of STRESS-ATTRACTS
(Kirk, 2001) that holds that intervocalic consonants are attracted to stressed
syllables. Unlike STRESS-TO-WEIGHT, it does not rely on mora counts. This
constraint has support from results of psycholinguistic experiments (e.g. Kirk,
2001) that point to the greater tendency of a single intervocalic consonant to be
syllabified as part of the preceding stressed syllable compared to a preceding
110
unstressed syllable even in cases in which the preceding vowel is tense rather
than lax.52
5.3.5.2 Stop-liquid clusters
Given the above analysis, it is striking that intervocalic stop-liquid clusters (across
all categories) never reduce to the liquid. Thus, the initial-medial asymmetry in
reduction patterns found for s-stop clusters is completely absent for stop-liquid
clusters: in both initial and medial position /br/ reduces to [b]. This outcome is
puzzling at first glance, given the fixed constraint ranking for codas, reflecting
the fact that sonorants are better codas than obstruents. It is also inconsistent
with results from some syllabification studies that show that an intervocalic
single consonant is more likely to affiliate to a previous syllable when it is a
sonorant than when it is an obstruent (e.g. Treiman & Danis, 1988).53
One possible explanation for such a pattern is that the intervocalic /C/ is
simultaneously an onset and a coda (i.e. ambisyllabic), subject, therefore, to a
constraint against liquid onsets. If *ONSET-LIQUID outranks *CODA-STOP, a stop-
52 There is a further way of accounting for the initial-medial asymmetry that is independent of
syllable structure. Lenition is a process that commonly occurs in the intervocalic environment. A
constraint which favors continuants intervocalically (i.e. *VC[STOP]V) may explain the greater
percentage of /s/ selection in both medial environments over the initial environment. However, it
does not capture the post-lax – post-tense difference discussed above.
53 Interestingly, van der Pas (2004) found that stop-liquid clusters are sometimes reduced to the
liquid in children acquiring Dutch. Since s-stop clusters are at the same time reduced to the stop,
she takes this to be evidence of IO-CONTIGUITY in phonological acquisition.
111
liquid cluster will be reduced to the stop, assuming that the single consonant is
an onset or onset AND coda, but never as a coda by itself.

While the ranking in (8) accounts for grammars in which the liquid is not

112
Since the grammar in (9) is consistent with at least one permutation of the
sonority constraints for onsets and codas, we should expect at least a small
difference on average between medial and initial position, as we did for s-stop
clusters. The fact that /l/ is never selected, i.e. that we find 100% retention rate of
the stop in all categories, could be a result of the small number of subjects in the
experiment, and/or of a generalized constraint against liquids (*LIQUID: Barlow,
2001). In the following paragraph, I offer another potential explanation for the
asymmetry.
5.3.5.3 Head faithfulness
In the preceding discussion, I suggested a markedness explanation for the
tendency of the /s/ of s-stop clusters to be preserved more often in medial
position than in initial position. In medial position an intervocalic consonant is
sometimes syllabified as a coda or is ambisyllabic, and fricatives are better codas
than stops on account of their higher sonority. On the other hand, the fact that
the liquid of stop-liquid clusters is never preserved may be due to the greater
relative markedness differential between stops and liquids as onsets in
comparison to stops and fricatives as codas. However, an alternative analysis of
these results is based on faithfulness constraints. Both the /s/ of intervocalic s-
stop clusters and the stop of intervocalic stop-liquid clusters are the first of the two
consonants in the cluster. Assuming that the first consonant is sometimes a coda
113
in the adult output, and, therefore, in the stressed syllable, it may be protected by
a type of HEAD FAITHFULNESS (Goad & Rose, 2004; Rose, 2000). On the other
hand, when the syllable following the cluster is stressed, both stop and liquid are
found in the stressed syllable. A contextual (prosodic) faithfulness constraint
that can capture this result is defined below:
(10) HEAD-MAX: every element of the stressed syllable in the input must be
present in the output. One violation is assigned for each segment in the stressed
syllable of the input that is absent from the output.
In order for this constraint to distinguish between competing output candidates
in which one or the other of a 2-member cluster is preserved, one needs to
assume that the child’s input contains not only stress, but also syllable structure.
This assumption raises some obvious questions. First, in the cases in which more
than one syllabification of an intervocalic cluster satisfies the phonotactics of the
language (e.g. [V's.pV] vs. [V'.spV]), which syllabification do we assume the
child uses as input to his production grammar? A second crucially related
question is how the child arrives at such a parse in the absence of clear phonetic
cues to syllable boundaries. I propose that the answer to these questions is that
precisely in the cases in which the child is unable to read a unique structure
directly off the adult output, the child’s input representation is variable, at least
114
in so far as syllable structure is concerned.54
However, such a lack of uniformity
does not preclude certain predictions as to how consonant selection is affected by
context. The tableau below illustrates the two possible inputs to a grammar that
contains a high ranking of HEAD-MAX.
(11) HEAD-MAX >> *ONSET-FRICATIVE
/V's.pV/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
La. [V.sV] *
b. [V.pV] *!
/V’.spV/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
c. [V.sV] *!
Ld. [V.pV]
Tableau (11) is designed to illustrate that given a high ranking of HEAD-MAX, the
choice of one or the other consonant can be a product of a property of the input:
where the syllable boundary falls, and thus, whether C1 is included in the
stressed syllable or not. Since in the adult grammar of English both
syllabifications are possible on account of the legality principle alone ([s] occurs
word-finally; [sp] occurs word initially), it is not obvious what assumptions to
make about what the child’s judgement of that boundary is. In fact, there is no
reason not to assume variability on the perceptual level.55
54 This idea is consistent with results from psycholinguistic research attesting to variability in
syllabification judgements of intervocalic consonants in adults.
55 Following Pater (2004) we can assume constraint rankings in multiple domains; for example,
rankings that govern the mapping between the adult (surface) form and the child's lexical form.
115
Recall that I am not making assumptions as to what the overall preference of
consonant will be in medial position, but am interested, rather, in comparing the
tendency to select one consonant over the other across different contexts. Word
initially we expect no ambiguity in syllabic affiliation. Specifically, there is no
parse in which /s/ is part of a stressed syllable to the exclusion of the immediately
following stop. Because there is uniformity in this environment (stop chosen
over /s/ on account of *ONSET-FRICATIVE) and potential variability in the medial
environment (/s/ sometimes chosen over stop by HEAD-MAX), there is an overall
greater likelihood of /s/ being selected word medially than word initially.
Likewise, because the first of a pair of intervocalic consonants is more
likely to be syllabified as a coda to a preceding stressed syllable following a lax
vowel than following a tense vowel, we predict an overall greater percentage of
/s/ response in the former environment than in the latter. This prediction is not
tantamount to claiming that in the post-lax environment the /s/ is always part of
the preceding syllable in the adult form or in the child's input, while in the post-
tense environment, the /s/ is generally part of the following syllable. The child
may treat all intervocalic /sC/ clusters as heterosyllabic or all of them as
tautosyllabic, or may have variable representations that depend on the stress and
quality of the previous vowel. What is not expected is that the cluster be treated
as heterosyllabic more often following a stressed tense vowel than following a
116
stressed lax vowel or more often following an unstressed syllable than following
a stressed syllable.
5.4 Conclusion and follow-up
The results of this experiment have demonstrated how certain acquisitional
asymmetries pattern in a way consistent with interactions among syllable-based
markedness constraints, such as those of the sonority family and those pertaining
to syllable weight and stress. Both types of constraints were shown to be
potential factors in the rate at which initial and medial stop-liquid and s-stop
clusters were produced faithfully and the preference given to one consonant over
the other in the cases in which reduction occurred.
SSP and SYLLABLE-CONTACT result in s-stop clusters being marked in initial
position and unmarked in medial position (assuming they are sometimes
heterosyllabic), relative to stop-liquid clusters. STRESS-TO-WEIGHT was shown to
affect order of acquisition in that clusters were produced more consistently when
the previous syllable was stressed and contained a lax vowel than in other
prosodic contexts.
With regard to cluster reduction, the margin constraints (e.g. *ONSET-
LIQUID) may have interacted with STRESS-TO-WEIGHT in an interesting way. The
fact that /s/ was preserved at a greater rate in the post-lax condition than in any
other could be an indication that /s/ is a coda more often in that context than in
117
the others (by *CODA-STOP). This result has a straightforward explanation in the
activity of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT in children’s developing grammars: a singleton
consonant is more likely to function as a coda when preceded by a monomoraic
stressed vowel than by a bimoraic stressed vowel or an unstressed syllable. The
fact that no such asymmetry was attested in stop-liquid cluster reduction may
have to do with the greater distance in sonority between stops and liquids than
between stops and fricatives. If singleton intervocalic consonants are sometimes
ambisyllabic, it is possible that while a fricative is tolerated as an onset (/s/ of s-
stop clusters), a liquid is not.
A competing hypothesis is based upon a type of positional faithfulness
constraint and regards the question of whether the order of the two consonants
makes a difference in the decision to retain C1 or C2, independent of the identity
of the consonant, but dependent, crucially, on where the stress falls. The first
experiment did not provide a means of distinguishing between the two
hypotheses. This is the topic of the next experiment.
118
CHAPTER 6
EXPERIMENT 2
PROSODIC MARKEDNESS AND FAITHFULNESS IN
S-STOP VS. STOP-S INTERVOCALIC CLUSTERS
6.1 Introduction
The main objective of the experiment described in this chapter is to extend the
previous study of cluster reduction in medial (intervocalic) s-stop clusters to that
in medial stop-s clusters. In Experiment 1 (see Chapter 5), among the tokens
containing clusters that subjects reduced, /s/ was preserved over the stop more
often in medial position than in initial position and more often when the
preceding stressed syllable contained a lax vowel than when it contained a tense
one. In both of the contexts in which /s/ preservation is greater, there is also a
greater likelihood of the single intervocalic consonant being syllabified as a coda.
An explanation for the asymmetries is that STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and/or
STRESS-ATTRACTS motivate ambisyllabicity of intervocalic consonants in English,
in particular when a preceding stressed syllable contains a lax vowel. Thus,
sonority-based *CODA-STOP >> *CODA-FRICATIVE results in /s/ being chosen more
frequently precisely in those contexts in which it is a coda (or ambisyllabic) than
in those in which it is an onset alone.
119
An alternative explanation advanced at the end of Chapter 5 is based
upon the position of the consonants in the input (as C1 or C2 of the cluster), in
addition to the stress profile of the word in question. Following a stressed
syllable, the first consonant of the sequence, /s/ of s-stop clusters, is protected by
a constraint of the HEAD FAITHFULNESS family, assuming it is part of the stressed
syllable in the adult output (e.g. [V’s.pV]). This explanation makes no
assumptions as to the syllabic affiliation of the intervocalic consonant in the
child’s output; that is, it does not rely on assumptions of ambisyllabicity.
HEAD FAITHFULNESS (e.g. Alderete, 1999; Goad & Rose, 2004; McCarthy,
2000; Rose, 2000) requires that segments present in the head syllable of the input
be present in the output, meaning that C1 of a heterosyllabic cluster following a
stressed vowel may be chosen over C2, even if it results in a more sonorous onset.
On the other hand, when the syllable preceding an s-stop cluster is unstressed
and the following syllable stressed, not only is the stop (as C2) unambiguously
part of the stressed syllable, but it is also less sonorous than the /s/, meaning that
markedness and faithfulness constraints converge on the same preferred
candidate: the stop. Examples of the mappings suggested above and relevant
constraint rankings are given in the tableau below.
120

g. [V.sV’] * *!
Lh. [V.pV’] *
When stress precedes the cluster (i.e. occurs on syllable 1) and the cluster is taken
to be heterosyllabic, the consonant preserved is the first of the two (=/s/) because
it belongs to the stressed syllable of the input, even though it is a worse onset
from the standpoint of sonority (1a). If the cluster is taken to be tautosyllabic,
HEAD-MAX cannot decide between the candidates and the one containing /p/ is
selected on the basis of *ONSET-FRICATIVE (1d).
When stress occurs on syllable 2 (and syllable 1 is unstressed), /s/ will not
be chosen over /p/ no matter which syllabification is assumed. When the cluster
is heterosyllabic, both HEAD-MAX and *ONSET-FRICATIVE select the output in which
[p] surfaces (1f). When the cluster is tautosyllabic, HEAD-MAX does not
distinguish between the candidates, while *ONSET-FRICATIVE still prefers [p] (1h).
121
From the tableau in (1) we can glean simply that the /s/ of an s-stop cluster
should be selected more often when the syllable preceding the cluster is stressed
than when the syllable following the cluster is stressed. And, as discussed in the
conclusion to Chapter 5, we can also predict that /s/ will be chosen more often in
the medial than in the initial context and more often in the post-lax context than
in the post-tense context. These predictions are possible, even allowing for
variation in input syllabification.56
Because the order of the two consonants (/s/ and stop) was not varied in
Experiment 1, it was not possible to ascertain for which of the two accounts –
markedness or faithfulness – stronger evidence exists. Furthermore, results for
the post-unstressed condition in Experiment 1 were not included in the analysis,
due to the preponderance of initial unstressed syllable deletion. Experiment 2,
the subject of this chapter, was designed precisely to study further these
hypotheses by comparing the reduction patterns for s-stop clusters to those for
stop-s clusters. In addition to order of the two consonants, stress and vowel
quality were manipulated, as in Experiment 1. The experiment was run on
slightly older children in order to increase the likelihood of initial unstressed
syllables being retained.
56 I assume that in cases in which the intervocalic cluster is not a licit onset cluster (e.g. pt),
syllabification is not variable. The child arrives at an input syllable parse which is consistent with
the phonotactics of the adult language.
122
6.2 Hypotheses - reduction
6.2.1 Sonority (markedness) hypothesis
We may start by assuming that in both child and adult productions, an
intervocalic /C/ may associate to a preceding stressed syllable when the
following syllable is unstressed, but not to a preceding unstressed syllable when
the following syllable is stressed. This is because, while STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and
STRESS-ATTRACTS (Kirk, 2001) favor the association of an intervocalic consonant to
a stressed syllable, no constraint is satisfied by an intervocalic consonant being
either a coda or ambisyllabic when it follows an unstressed syllable and precedes
a stressed one.57
On account of the fact that a fricative (=/s/) is more sonorous
than a stop, given the margin hierarchy for codas (e.g. *CODA-STOP >> *CODA-
FRICATIVE, etc.), I predict that /s/ will be selected more often in the two post-stress
conditions (post-lax and post-tense) than in the post-unstressed condition.
Furthermore, STRESS-TO-WEIGHT predicts that an intervocalic single /C/ will
associate to a previous stressed syllable more often when that syllable contains a
lax vowel than when it contains a tense vowel, because when the vowel is tense,
the stressed syllable is already heavy and, thus, the constraint is satisfied.
57 Gussenhoven (1986) uses evidence from flapping in English to argue that intervocalic
consonants are ambisyllabic in the post-unstressed environment as well, but only when the
following context is another unstressed syllable. I use no test condition of this sort in my
experiments. The condition labeled as post-unstressed is the one in which the cluster follows an
unstressed syllable and precedes a stressed one.
123
Therefore, I expect a greater percentage of /s/ retention in the post-lax condition
than in the post-tense condition.
6.2.2 Faithfulness hypothesis
The alternative hypothesis is that HEAD-MAX is responsible for the selection of
one of the two intervocalic consonants when reduction occurs. This would
predict patterns that reflect both differences in stress placement in the target
word in addition to the order in which the two consonants – stop and fricative –
occur in the target. If, on the other hand, markedness alone is responsible, then
there should be no difference in reduction preferences in the outputs between s-
stop and stop-s clusters when all else is held constant. The following table
illustrates the way in which the two theories make different predictions once we
introduce stop-s clusters to the stimuli set.
The three columns include stress, vowel quality and input order of the two
consonants (stop + fricative) as the variables with a potential of affecting the
outcome. Specified in each cell is whether or not the variable is predicted to
matter (YES vs. NO) and if YES, in which direction the effect is predicted to go in
terms of overall percentage of /s/ selection.

6.3 Order of acquisition: objectives and hypotheses
While the primary objective of this experiment was to gain additional
information about what drives medial reduction preferences, the resulting data
can, in addition, address questions about the order of acquisition of medial
clusters. For example, SYLLABLE-CONTACT predicts that medial s-stop clusters
will be produced more systematically than medial stop-s clusters, since there is a
sonority drop in the former and a sonority rise in the latter. This prediction
hinges upon s-stop in addition to stop-s clusters being heterosyllabic in medial
position, which seems likely for many children, given the fact that codas tend to
come in earlier than complex onsets and s-stop onset clusters are particularly
marked.
58 This implies again that input representations may vary among / within children and that
markedness constraints play a role in this mapping as well.
125
Secondly, because prosody is manipulated, I can test again the prediction
that clusters will be produced more faithfully in the post-lax condition than in
the post-tense or the post-unstressed conditions, given STRESS-TO-WEIGHT.

6.4 Methods
6.4.1 Subjects
Seventeen children of ages 2;2 to 3;1 participated in this experiment. They were
interviewed individually in their homes or at daycare centers. The average age
of the children at the time of testing was 2;8. None of the children had any
known speech or hearing disorders. All children were native English speakers.
6.4.2 Stimuli
Stimuli consisted of novel names in which the cluster and prosody of the words
were manipulated. All stimuli contained one intervocalic cluster, either s-stop or
stop-s and included velar and bilabial voiceless stops (i.e. /k/ and /p/). The other
variable manipulated was prosodic context: conditions included post-lax (cluster
follows a stressed syllable containing a lax vowel), post-tense (cluster follows a
stressed syllable containing a tense vowel), and post-unstressed (cluster follows
an unstressed syllable and precedes a stressed syllable). Stimuli in the post-lax
126
and post-tense categories were all disyllabic. Stimuli in the post-unstressed
category were two or three syllables long, with equal numbers of each used for
the two cluster types. The stimuli began with one of the following consonants:
[t,s,k,n] and ended in one of [i,n,c,o]. There were 4 tokens presented for each
category (e.g. post-lax /sk/). Examples are given in below.

6.4.3 Procedure
All potential subjects were required to perform a pre-test in which their
pronunciation of singleton consonants in onset and coda position was tested.
These consonants included /s/, /k/, and /p/, since these are the members of the
clusters tested in this experiment. The words were elicited using either a picture
book or the props (i.e. stuffed animals) used for the experiment itself. A subject
was NOT excluded from participation in the experiment if /k/ was fronted (i.e.
/k/ → [t]), since this did not change the manner of articulation, and hence,
relative sonority of the consonant. All of the children put to this pretest
successfully produced the consonants as singletons in both onset and coda
position.
127
In the experiment itself, two procedures were employed. The first was
identical to that used in Experiment 1, in which children were prompted to name
a series of stuffed animals and dolls, repeating stimuli names that were
randomly selected by the experimenter from small cards that had been shuffled
together. The second procedure made use of a large piece of poster board
containing pictures of people. Subjects were given the cards with the stimulus
names written upon them and were asked to place one card on top of each
picture, as indicated by the experimenter. The name was uttered first by the
experimenter, and the child was then prompted to say the name before placing
the card on top of the relevant picture. Generally, the toys were used first and
the pictures second, if necessary to finish eliciting stimuli. Two repetitions of
each stimulus were sought.
6.5 Results & discussion (reduction)
6.5.1 Results
Results were transcribed by the author, and 10-15% of the data were subjected to
independent transcription by a student in the department of Communication
Disorders at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who had prior training in
phonetic transcription. Overall inter-transcriber agreement for this data set was
93%. Agreement on whether or not deletion took place occurred 98% of the time.
In the agreed upon cases in which deletion occurred, the transcribers concurred
128
100% of the time as to which segment was preserved. Most of the overall
disagreement was a result of voicing differences.
Most children did not delete medial clusters systematically in all
conditions. As will be discussed in the analysis of order of acquisition, especially
in the post-lax and post-tense conditions, deletion occurred only sporadically for
the majority of the children. Therefore, it was not practical (or meaningful) to
calculate individual percentages of /s/ retention for each variable manipulated
(e.g. sp-lax) as input to an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), since total number of
deletions per individual subject was often zero in multiple categories. The chart
below contains data that has been pooled across all 17 subjects who participated.
The percentages represent the number of times /s/ was preserved divided by the
number of times cluster reduction occurred per condition, totaled across all
children.

Figure 8. Percentage of /s/ selection by cluster type and prosody.
The most notable result emerging from Figure 8 is the complete reversal in
consonant preference between s-stop and stop-s clusters in the post-unstressed
condition. When the first syllable is unstressed and the second one stressed, /s/ is
selected 100% of the time from stop-s clusters and 0% of the time from s-stop
clusters.
With regard to the effect of order (s=C1 or C2), when the first syllable is
stressed and the second one unstressed (post-lax and post-tense conditions), /s/
appears to be retained more often from s-stop clusters than from stop-s clusters
(in both post-tense and post-lax conditions), but there were not enough data per
individual in each condition to be able to test this observation by way of an
130
ANOVA. Therefore, post-lax and post-tense categories were collapsed into one
(=post-stress category) and individual raw data were used as input to a Wilcoxon
Signed Rank Test. The comparison involved the number of times for each child
that C1 vs. C2 was selected. Since predictions depend crucially on the placement
of stress, separate tests were run for each stress condition (stress on syllable 1 vs.
stress on syllable 2). Results indicate a significant preference for preserving C1
over C2 when the syllable preceding the cluster is stressed, S=67.0, p=.031, and
the reverse preference (C2 over C1) when the syllable following the cluster is
stressed, S=4.5, p=.008 (N=12 in both cases).59
With regard to the difference between post-tense and post-lax categories,
it appears from Figure 8 that /s/ is chosen more often in the post-lax category
than in the post-tense category, although this difference is greater for stop-s
clusters than for s-stop clusters. The small number of instances in which
reduction took place, especially for the post-lax condition, made it impractical to
evaluate this trend using the same statistical test (=Wilcoxon). Therefore data
were pooled across subjects and a chi-square analysis performed. The
comparison was /s/ vs. /p/ selection in the post-lax vs. post-tense contexts. The
result was significant, Chi-Sq=6.90 (df=1), p = .009 (df=1), meaning that vowel
quality (post-tense vs. post-lax) played a role in which consonant was selected.
59 A subject could not be included in this analysis if the number of tokens for which C1 was
selected was equal to the number of tokens for which C2 was selected.
131
6.5.2 Discussion
With regard to the choice of which consonant to preserve when the cluster
precedes a stressed syllable (=post-unstressed condition), the order of the two
consonants plays a dominant role. In both s-stop and stop-s clusters the
consonant preserved is the one (C2) that is adjacent to the stressed vowel. The
sonority and, hence, resulting relative markedness of the intervocalic /s/ vs. stop
as an onset appears to play no role in this context. On the contrary, the choice of
which consonant to preserve depends on an aspect of the input, hence the
conclusion that it is a faithfulness constraint that determines medial consonant
selection, at least in this environment. The proposed constraint is defined in (2)
and the tableau in (3) illustrates the necessary ranking between faithfulness and
sonority constraints.
(2) HEAD-MAX: segments that are part of the (primary) stressed syllable in the
input must be realized in the output. Goad & Rose (2004),etc.
(3) HEAD-MAX >> *ONSET-FRICATIVE
/Vp.sV’/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
La. [VsV] *
b. [VpV] *!
Under the assumption that the intervocalic consonant is an onset in (3a,b), it is
evident that sonority plays no role in the choice of which consonant to retain
when medial consonant reduction occurs. In every case, across all children,
132
when the syllable following the cluster is stressed, it is C2 that is preserved.
HEAD-MAX accounts for such a pattern.
The traditional account of the choice of the stop over /s/ in word-initial
cluster reduction has been linked to sonority, i.e. the existence of the constraint
*ONSET-FRICATIVE. Findings from the previous experiment that included word-
initial s-stop clusters conformed to this generalization: the stop was selected over
the fricative 94% of the time. Such data are not inconsistent with the claim being
made here. In the case of a cluster that is tautosyllabic, including a word- initial
C1C2, HEAD-MAX does not decide between the consonants. Precisely because the
consonants are in the same syllable, HEAD-MAX will evaluate the candidates
equally, regardless of whether the syllable is stressed or not.
(4) HEAD-MAX, *ONSET-FRICATIVE
/spV’/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
La. [pV’] *
b. [sV’] * *!
The tableau in (4) shows that the apparent predominance of HEAD-MAX in
consonant selection word medially is not inconsistent with the well-documented
pattern found in word initial position and the common explanation for it.60
60 Interestingly, another faithfulness constraint: IO-CONTIGUITY can explain a preference for the
stop over the fricative when s-stop sequences occur word-initially (see van der Pas, 2004 and
Gnanadesikan, 2004 for the use of such a constraint in acquisition). While general IO-CONTINUITY
by itself cannot be determinant in the medial context, if it is relativized to the syllable (see
Lamontagne, 1996) it may be able to do the same work as HEAD-MAX.
133
Likewise, it is likely that an s-stop cluster that follows an unstressed syllable is
not heterosyllabic, but is tautosyllabic (V.spV’). Such a syllabification is not
problematic for this proposal either; analogously to the word-initial example,
HEAD MAX will not choose between the two consonants in this context; therefore,
the decision is left up to sonority.
We might still wonder why, on the basis of these results, children appear
to give precedence to faithfulness over markedness so uniformly when it comes
to /s/-selection in stop-s clusters following an unstressed syllable (e.g. Vp.sV’)
(see Figure 8). Given the variation that often characterizes children’s outputs and
the possibility for constraint violation, it is surprising that sonority never wins.
Perhaps this is indication that a fricative is not such a bad onset, that is, that the
sonority difference between members of the obstruent family is not great enough
to play a role most of the time when a competing constraint favors a different
output candidate. The next experiment undertaken will examine heterosyllabic
clusters containing stop-nasal sequences as well as stop-fricative sequences, in
part to address such a concern.
When the syllable preceding the cluster is stressed, we find something of a
tendency to retain the consonant that is part of the stressed syllable: /s/ in the
case of s-stop and the stop in the case of stop-s. This pattern can, once again, be
accounted for by the constraint ranking shown below:
134
(5) HEAD-MAX >> *ONSET-FRICATIVE
/Vs’.pV/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
La. [VsV] *
b. [VpV] *!
/Vp’.sV/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
Lc. [VpV]
d. [VsV] * *!
Interestingly, unlike the finding for clusters preceding stressed syllables, the
pattern shown in (8) for clusters following stressed syllables is not exceptionless.
Not infrequently, C2 is selected over C1, even though it is not part of the stressed
syllable in the input. While overall instances of reduction in all environments do
not permit a statistical comparison between the two cases, it seems evident that
the tendency to retain the member of the stressed syllable is stronger when the
syllable following the cluster is stressed than when the syllable preceding the
cluster is stressed (see Figure 8). One possible explanation for this result is the
greater prominence of onsets when compared to codas, in so far as C1 is in coda
position, while C2 is in onset position. I will put off further discussion of this
asymmetry to the next chapter.
While I argued in the preceding paragraphs in favor of a role for
faithfulness constraints in the reduction of heterosyllabic intervocalic clusters,
the question remains as to whether markedness plays a role as well. The results
from this experiment suggest that they do. Independent of cluster type (i.e.
order of the two consonants), /s/ is preserved more often in the post-lax
135
environment than in the post-tense environment. As discussed with regard to
the results from Experiment 1, this supports the role of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and
*CODA-STOP: the former constraint will result in an intervocalic singleton
consonant being syllabified as part of the preceding syllable more often
following a lax vowel than following a tense vowel, while *CODA-STOP results in a
preference for fricatives over stops as codas. Having concluded the discussion of
reduction results, I address in the following section the order in which s-stop and
stop-s clusters are acquired in different prosodic contexts.
6.6 Results and discussion (order of acquisition)
6.6.1 Results
In order to be included in this analysis, subjects needed to have produced tokens
of each category (e.g. s-stop, post-unstressed) a minimum of 3 times. The
average number of total stimuli produced across all subjects was 37, equivalent
to approximately 6 per category. Only 1 subject was eliminated for having failed
to meet the minimal requirement.
In the first part of the analysis, the dependent variable was the percentage
of clusters faithfully produced. Percentages were calculated for each subject for
each of the 6 categories: post-lax, post-tense and post-unstressed x 2 (cluster type:
/sp/ vs. /ps/). The criteria used to determine when a cluster was faithfully
produced varied according to the effect being tested for, and will be described in
136
following. Errors included deletion (e.g. /ps/ → [p]), metathesis (e.g. /ps/ →
[sp]), manner feature change (e.g. /ps/ → [pt]), and place feature change (e.g. /sk/
→ [st]).
For the cluster type comparison (/sp/ vs. /ps/), a “faithful” cluster was
assessed as one in which neither deletion nor metathesis nor manner of
articulation changed. However, a cluster was still considered faithful if place of
articulation of the stop was altered (e.g. /sk/ → [st]). This is because the question
being asked was whether or not s-stop clusters were less marked in medial
position than stop-s clusters on the basis of sonority. Since some subjects still
resisted producing velar stops, in particular in onset position, fronting was not
an uncommon error, and since the sonority profile of the cluster did not change,
the mapping /sk/ → [st] was considered to be faithful for the purpose of these
analyses. In the graph below, the results are grouped so as to allow for s-stop vs.
stop-s comparisons for each prosodic condition.
137
Figure 9. Percentage of clusters produced faithfully: s-stop vs. stop-s.
For each prosodic context, the /sp/ clusters are produced more faithfully than the
/ps/ clusters, although the margin of difference is negligible for the post-
unstressed and post-tense conditions. A repeated measures 2 x 3 ANOVA
showed no main effect of cluster type (/ps/ vs. /sp/), no main effect for prosody,
and no interaction between cluster and prosody.
In a second ANOVA the criteria for faithfulness rested on the mere
presence of two consonants. This calculation was done in order to determine
whether the prosodic manipulation made a difference in the extent of deletion. If
unfaithful mappings had included instances of metathesis, for example, then the

results would not have been a valid measure of the effect of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT
since this constraint is blind to the segmental content of the consonants and
should affect, simply, the extent to which deletion takes place across the different
prosodic contexts.
The graph below illustrates the 3 prosodic conditions for /sp/ followed by /ps/
clusters.

(=no deletion), while among stop-s clusters, more clusters were preserved in the
post-tense condition than in the post-unstressed one, although none of the
margins between prosodic conditions were great.
A repeated measures ANOVA was once again carried out using the alternative
criterion for judging faithfulness (deletion vs. preservation). Results revealed a
main effect of prosody, F(2, 15) = 3.802, p=.032, no effect of cluster type and no
interaction between prosody and cluster type. Planned contrasts showed a
significant difference between the post-lax and the post-unstressed condition,
F(1, 16) = 13.522, p = .002 and a not quite significant difference between the post-
lax and post-tense conditions, F(1,16) = 3.269, p=.088.
6.6.2 Discussion
The overall lack of a difference in faithful realization rates of s-stop vs. stop-s
clusters implies a lack of support for the role of SYLLABLE CONTACT, since these
constraints predict that the former will be a better heterosyllabic cluster than the
latter. It seems feasible that the sonority difference between the fricative and
stop is too small for us to see the activity of these constraints in phonological
development, especially at the age of most subjects (> 2 ½ years) at which they
are already producing clusters of both types relatively accurately.
Secondly, cluster sequence constraints have been proposed in the
literature, which prefer those obstruent-obstruent clusters in which the coronal is
140
the second over those in which the coronal is the first (Bernhardt & Stemberger,
1998; Lamontagne, 1993; Yip, 1991). In acquisition (see Bernhardt & Stemberger,
1998), such a constraint might mask the effect of sonority markedness
constraints, as the two constraints prefer opposite clusters.
The trends with regard to the prosody manipulation are consistent with
those found in the previous experiment, although the effects are not as strong.
The proposal is that clusters tend to be produced more consistently following a
stressed lax vowel than a stressed tense vowel and an unstressed one on account
of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT.
6.7 Conclusion and follow-up
This experiment compared two hypotheses as to what drives consonant selection
in reduced intervocalic clusters consisting of a stop and a fricative. While the
hypotheses converge on more or less the same predictions in the case of s-stop
clusters alone (from Experiment 1), they part ways when the order of the two
consonants is reversed (=stop-s clusters). One hypothesis is based on
markedness, and specifically, on the constraints of the sonority family combined
with STRESS-TO-WEIGHT. It predicts that regardless of the order of the two
consonants in the input, the fricative will be chosen more often when the cluster
follows a stressed syllable than when it follows an unstressed syllable in the
input. For when reduction takes place, the resulting intervocalic singleton
141
consonant will be more likely to be syllabified as a coda after a stressed syllable
than an unstressed one. Sonority-driven margin constraints, being different for
onsets than for codas, are predicted to produce the asymmetry by which the
fricative is sometimes preferred after a stressed syllable (when it is more likely to
be a coda – or ambisyllabic), but not after an unstressed syllable in which context
the intervocalic consonant is most likely to be an onset.
The alternative hypothesis is based on faithfulness. It involves the
prediction that the outcome (=choice of consonant to retain) will depend on
properties of the child’s input representation. Specifically, there will be a
tendency to preserve the consonant that is part of the stressed syllable of the
input.
Results reveal strong support for the second (faithfulness) hypothesis in
addition to some added support for the markedness one. We find that the order
of the consonants in the input (as C1 or C2 of the cluster) plays a crucial role in
determining which consonant gets retained, both in the case in which stress
precedes the cluster, and in the case in which stress follows the cluster, although
the effect is stronger when stress follows the cluster. When stress precedes the
cluster, C1 is more likely to be chosen than C2. When stress follows the cluster, C2
is more likely to be chosen than C1. The conclusion here is that a type of prosodic
faithfulness constraint plays an important role in medial consonant selection.
142
The question remains as to whether markedness matters at all in
intervocalic consonant selection. The results of this experiment suggest that it
does. There was a difference found in the percentage of /s/ vs. stop preservation
in the post-tense vs. post-lax conditions, independent of order of consonants. As
suggested in the previous discussion, under the influence of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT,
the intervocalic singleton consonant is presumably a coda (or ambisyllabic) some
of the time following at least a lax stressed vowel and less often following a tense
vowel. This can account for the higher rates of /s/ selection in the post-lax
context than in the post-tense context.
While there is some evidence that markedness and faithfulness compete
when the syllable preceding the input cluster is stressed, the pattern is different
when the following syllable is stressed. In this case, the selected consonant is
always C2, and the relative sonority of the consonants seems to play little role.
Regarding order of acquisition, we find little evidence for SYLLABLE
CONTACT in driving differences between production rates of s-stop and stop-s
clusters. I have suggested that this could be due, in part, to the preference given
to coronals as the 2nd
of two adjacent obstruents - when one is coronal and the
other labial or dorsal. Furthermore, perhaps the sonority difference between
fricatives and stops is too close for a distinction between the two clusters to be
143
apparent, especially in children who are producing both clusters relatively
faithfully (>70%).
The next experiment is designed with the objective of utilizing clusters
that are uncommon (if not illegal) in English, in order to bring down the overall
rate of correct pronunciation, so that asymmetries are more likely to be apparent.
Also, clusters used will include a consonant pair other than stop-fricative
combinations.

CHAPTER 7
EXPERIMENT 3
PROSODIC MARKEDNESS AND FAITHFULNESS IN MEDIAL
CLUSTER PRODUCTION AND REDUCTION: PART 2
7.1 Introduction
The subject of this chapter, Experiment 3, extends the investigation undertaken
in the previous experiment to clusters containing stops and a fricative other than
/s/, in addition to clusters consisting of stops and nasals. The first objective is to
assess, using a different set of clusters, the relative strength of prosodic
faithfulness vs. markedness constraints in consonant selection when clusters are
reduced. The second objective (as in the previous experiments) is to compare
rates of preservation of the different clusters in varying prosodic conditions in
order to assess the activity of SYLLABLE CONTACT and STRESS-TO-WEIGHT in
acquisition.
The intervocalic clusters tested in this experiment are either prohibited or,
at the very best, marginal in English, and consist of /fk/, /kf/, /mk/, and /km/.
Because of the relative markedness and lexical infrequency of these clusters, I
suspected that subjects of approximately the same ages as those recruited for the
previous experiment would reduce the clusters more frequently, thus generating
more reduction data to analyze. Furthermore, /fk/ and /kf/ clusters differ from
145
the s-stop/stop-s clusters used in the last experiment in that clusters containing
/s/ can occur at word edges, implying permissible tautosyllabicity. By using
clusters that are unambiguously heterosyllabic, interpreting results on the basis
of faithfulness to input prosodic structure is more straightforward. Additional
factors behind the choice of clusters are discussed in the following sections.
However, before elaborating further on the experiment itself, I review details
regarding the status of these clusters in the phonology of English.
7.2 Place restrictions on medial clusters in English
The obstruent clusters used in this experiment, /fk/ and /kf/, are generally
prohibited in English because each of the consonants in the cluster occurs at a
marked place of articulation (dorsal-labial/labial-dorsal) (Bernhardt &
Stemberger, 1998; Lamontagne, 1993; Yip, 1991, etc.). As discussed in Chapter 6,
two adjacent obstruents are permitted in English only as long as one of them is
coronal.61
Compared to obstruent-obstruent sequences, obstruent-sonorant clusters
have a greater degree of combinatory freedom in place of articulation, even
though dorsal-labial sequences consisting of stop + nasal are not particularly
common (e.g. enigma, acme) (Lamontagne, 1993). On the other hand, a cluster
containing these consonants in the reverse order (e.g. /mk/) is illicit in English
61 For different explanations behind the markedness of such clusters, see, for example,
Lamontagne (1993), and Yip (1991).
146
because of the homorganicity requirement on nasal-stop clusters (e.g. Giegerich,
1992; Hammond, 1999).
7.3 Hypotheses
As in Chapter 6, I discuss predictions regarding reduction choices before those
regarding order of acquisition.
7.3.1 Reduction hypotheses
The strongest finding to emerge from the reduction analysis of Experiment 2 was
the tendency to preserve C2 over C1 in the environment following an unstressed
syllable and preceding a stressed one (“post-unstressed” condition). This
outcome was independent of cluster type and was taken to be motivated by a
prosodic faithfulness constraint, defined preliminarily as HEAD-MAX. Sonority
played no role at all in this environment, as evidenced by the nearly exclusive
selection of C2 from both clusters (s-stop and stop-s); this result seems at odds
with the usual claim that the choice of the stop over the fricative in early child
productions of word-initial s-stop clusters (in conjunction with the tendency to
select the stop over the liquid from stop-liquid clusters) is due to a preference for
the least sonorous segment in onset position (and hence, to the activity of *ONSET-
FRICATIVE). However, in initial position HEAD-MAX evaluates the presence of C1
vs. C2 equally, as they are in the same syllable in the input, be it stressed or
unstressed. In the medial (post-unstressed) context, we may find an analogous
147
result if the two consonants are in the same syllable when the /s/ precedes the
stop (e.g. nc.skó). In both cases sonority will choose C2 over C1.

b. [sV] * *!
/V.spV’/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
Lc. [V.pV’] *
d. [V.sV’] * *!
When the /s/ follows the stop, on the other hand, the consonants are
heterosyllabic (e.g. swp.sín). HEAD-MAX thus chooses the consonant (=C2) that is
part of the stressed syllable in the input (=s).
(2) HEAD-MAX >> *ONSET-FRICATIVE
/Vp.sV’/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
La.[V.sV’] *
b. [V.pV’] *!
I suggested in the previous chapter that the reason why the markedness
constraint *ONSET-FRICATIVE never seems to prevail over HEAD-MAX in this
context has to do with its low ranking in the child’s constraint hierarchy,
reflective of the fact that fricatives are not so different from stops in terms of their
relative sonority, and, therefore, are not such bad onsets. Recall that *ONSET-
FRICATIVE is at the very bottom of the hierarchy of margin constraints; therefore,
it is no great surprise that its effects are not felt in the presence of a competing
constraint (in this case, HEAD-MAX).
148
Thus, one of the reasons why stop-nasal clusters are tested in this
experiment is to allow for further examination of the conflict between sonority
and faithfulness in intervocalic position. While the nasal may still be retained
over the stop some (or much) of the time due to high-ranked HEAD-MAX, an
asymmetry becomes possible between stop-nasal clusters and nasal-stop clusters.
When the syllable following the cluster is stressed, we might expect C2 to be
preserved more often in the case of nasal-stop clusters than in the case of stop-
nasal clusters, since the stop makes the better onset. In other words, while HEAD-
MAX will always choose C2 (=nasal or stop, depending on the sequence in the
input), markedness will never choose the nasal. This is shown below.

149
From (3) and (4) (a) and (b) we see that the relative ranking between the margin
(sonority) constraint and the faithfulness constraint makes no difference in the
selection of /m/ vs. /k/ in /mk/ clusters: both constraints choose /k/. In the case of
the stop-nasal cluster, markedness and faithfulness choose different candidates.
The ranking of markedness over faithfulness results in selection of the stop (3c),
while the reverse ranking results in preservation of the nasal (4d), since the nasal
is C2 and thus a member of the stressed syllable in the input. Assuming that
some intermediate grammars will resemble (3), while others resemble (4), this
difference between /km/ and /mk/ clusters is behind the prediction that C2 will be
chosen more often in the case of /mk/ clusters than in the case of /km/ clusters.62
62 Although nasals are considered to be marked compared to obstruents in onset position on
account of their greater sonority, it is also the case that independent of syllabic position, nasals
are acquired relatively early in children’s speech, earlier, in most cases, than fricatives (e.g.
Fikkert, 1994; Ingram, 1989; Stoel-Gammon & Dunn, 1985). Position-independent markedness
constraints relative to classes of segments have been argued for, for example, in Pater & Barlow
(2003) (*FRICATIVE) and Barlow (2001) (*LIQUID).
150
While the same prediction could be made for /fk/ vs. /kf/ clusters on
account of the constraint *ONSET-FRICATIVE, we saw no effect of this constraint in
the same prosodic condition in the last experiment. Perhaps this is reflective of
the small difference in sonority between fricatives and stops. 63
When the syllable preceding the cluster is stressed, results from the
previous experiment suggest that there is a preference for selecting C1 over C2;
however, the pressure to do so was less strong than in the case in which the
syllable following the cluster is stressed. Furthermore, sonority and STRESS-TO-
WEIGHT played a role as well in this environment (post-tense and post-lax
conditions): the fricative was more likely to be preserved in the post-lax
condition than in the post-tense condition, implying that it is a coda more often
following a stressed lax vowel than following a stressed tense one. While it isn’t
possible to establish for any one token whether the pronounced singleton
consonant is ambisyllabic or only an onset in the child's speech, we can assume
that along a continuum (and allowing for both inter- and intra-child variation),
there will be more codas (i.e. ambisyllabic consonants) following a lax vowel in a
63
However, recall that differences were found in the rate at which stop vs. fricative was selected
in the post-lax vs. post-tense conditions of the previous experiment. I surmised that this was an
effect of a fricative being a better coda than a stop. This interpretation is, thus, inconsistent with
the lack of evidence for a preference of stop over fricative as an (intervocalic) onset. Perhaps this
asymmetry is a consequence of *CODA-STOP being at the top of the coda sonority hierarchy
(*CODA-STOP >> *CODA-FRICATIVE >> *CODA-NASAL >> *CODA-LIQUID), while *ONSET-FRICATIVE is at
the bottom of the onset constraint hierarchy (*ONSET-GLIDE >> *ONSET-LIQUID >> *ONSET-NASAL >>
*ONSET-FRICATIVE).

stressed syllable than following a tense vowel. Therefore, the /f/ of /fk/ and /kf/
clusters should be chosen more often in the post-lax than in the post-tense
condition.

The tableau in (5) illustrates a potential disjunction in consonant selection
following lax vs. tense stressed vowels. Following a lax vowel, the fricative is
chosen, while following a tense vowel, the stop is selected. This asymmetry
follows from a specific ranking of constraints, one in which STRESS-TO-WEIGHT
and ONSET outrank the constraint against ambisyllabicity AND *ONSET-FRICATIVE
outranks *CODA-STOP. Clearly a different permutation of these constraints would
152
result in the stop being chosen in both instances (exemplified below in tableau
(6); however, no ranking of these constraints would result in the opposite
asymmetry: one in which /f/ is selected after a tense vowel and /k/ after a lax one.

7.3.2 Hypotheses: order of acquisition
Again in this experiment I am interested in the influence of prosodic markedness
constraints, SYLLABLE CONTACT and STRESS-TO-WEIGHT on cluster learning.
SYLLABLE-CONTACT predicts that among the heterosyllabic clusters targeted in
this experiment, /fk/ will be favored over /kf/ and /mk/ will be favored over /km/.
Within both pairs, the first cluster constitutes a fall in sonority between onset and
153
coda, while the second involves a rise in sonority between onset and coda.
Furthermore, /kf/ is also preferred to /km/ and /mk/ is preferred to /fk/. The less
sonorous C2 is with respect to C1, the better the heterosyllabic cluster is from the
standpoint of sonority. This was another reason why nasal-stop / stop-nasal
clusters were tested along with fricative-stop / stop-fricative clusters in this
experiment. Results from the last experiment showed no effect of SYLLABLE
CONTACT, as there was no difference in faithful production of s-stop vs. and stop-
s clusters, contrary to predictions. One explanation given was that the difference
between stops and fricatives in terms of sonority is perhaps not large enough to
produce a discernable difference in faithful production of clusters among
children acquiring English, especially since, in general, medial (heterosyllabic)
clusters seem to appear early in the speech of many children. For this reason, I
chose a pair of clusters for this experiment that represented larger sonority
differences between (1) and (2). Predictions regarding markedness of clusters on
the basis of sonority are reviewed schematically below (“>” = preferred over):
(7) a. /fk/ (sonority difference = 1) > /kf/ (sonority difference = -1)
b. /mk/ (sonority difference = 2) > /km/ (sonority difference = -2)
c. /mk/ (sonority difference = 2) > /fk/ (sonority difference =1)
d. /kf/ (sonority difference = -1) > /km/ (sonority difference =-2)
(8) Predicted order of markedness (based on SYLL-CON) mk > fk > kf > km.
With regard to the manipulation of prosody, the prediction is identical to that of
the two preceding experiments: clusters will be produced more faithfully in the
154
post-lax condition than in the post-tense or the post-unstressed conditions. This
is the product of the constraint STRESS-TO-WEIGHT.
7.4 Methods
7.4.1 Subjects
Seventeen children of ages 2;2 to 3;2 participated in this experiment. They were
interviewed individually in their homes or at daycare centers. The average age
of the children at the time of testing was 2;7. None of the children had any
known speech or hearing disorders. All children were native English speakers.
7.4.2 Stimuli
Stimuli consisted again of novel names in which the cluster and prosody of the
words were manipulated. All stimuli contained one intervocalic cluster of the
following types: /fk/, /kf/, /mk/, or /km/. The other variable manipulated was
prosodic context; as before, the three contexts were post-lax (cluster follows a
stressed syllable containing a lax vowel), post-tense (cluster follows a stressed
syllable containing a tense vowel), and post-unstressed (cluster follows an
unstressed syllable and precedes a stressed syllable). Stimuli in the post-lax and
post-tense categories were all disyllabic. Stimuli in the post-unstressed category
were two or three syllables long, with equal distribution between cluster types.
The stimuli began with one of the following consonants: [s,t,n,d,m,l] and ended
in one of [i,n,e,c,o,s]. Lax vowels used were [c,e,w,],]. Tense vowels were
155
[ej,i,ow,u]. There were 60 stimuli total, 5 in each condition. Examples are given
in the table below.

7.4.3 Procedure
The same pretest described for the previous experiments was used here.
I recorded the stimuli from my own voice using the MicroMic II C420 by AKG in
conjunction with a cd recorder (Tascam CD RW-700) at a sampling rate of
44.1khz. They were then segmented in Praat 4.2.34 (Boersma, 2004). A separate
.wav file was created for each stimulus, and each file was then linked to an
animal animation that had been downloaded into Powerpoint. In constructing
the presentation, stimuli were randomly ordered by shuffling index cards that
contained one stimulus per card. Four versions of the presentation were created
that differed in order of slides; subjects were assigned, alternately, to each
version. The experiment was run off of a laptop computer and the internal
speakers were used.
During the experiment, on each slide subjects viewed one, two, or three
animated figures. The experimenter clicked on an image in order to play a
156
stimulus (=the name attributed to the animated character). After hearing the
stimulus played twice, the child was asked to repeat the name. If the child did
not respond, the experimenter played the stimulus two more times. If the subject
failed to say the name after that attempt, the experimenter moved on to the next
slide and, if time permitted, returned to the skipped slide at the end of the
experiment. Because there were so many stimuli in this experiment, it was not
always possible to get through the entire experiment at one sitting.64 In these
instances, note was taken of which slides had been shown, and the child was run
on the remaining portion of the experiment on a subsequent date. This occurred
with three children. In those cases, I pooled the data from both days, since no
more than one week had elapsed between the two sessions. In a fourth case a
child did not finish the experiment on the first try and was tested again three
months later. The child was younger than two years at the first meeting and had
difficulty engaging in the task. During the second meeting the child completed
the experiment relatively quickly; in this case, I coded only the second set of data
since the first round included responses for less than 50% of the stimuli and
because too much time had elapsed between the two meetings to treat the results
effectively as the data of one individual.
64 As was the case in all of the other experiments, the length of time it took for children to perform
the task varied considerably: anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes.

7.5 Results & discussion
7.5.1 Reduction
7.5.1.1 Results
Results were transcribed and coded by the author and 10-15% of the data were
subjected to independent transcription by a student in the department of
Communication Disorders at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Overall
inter-transcriber agreement for this data set was 84%. Agreement on whether or
not deletion took place occurred 94% of the time. In the agreed upon cases in
which deletion occurred, the transcribers concurred 100% of the time on the
segment that was preserved. Most of the disagreement was a result of voicing
differences and place of articulation differences, particularly in nasals.
The results are presented first for the /kf/ and /fk/ clusters. The dependent
variable is percentage of /f/ selection. Once again, and somewhat surprisingly
for these clusters, given their infrequency in English, we find deletion rates to be
low among subjects for virtually all conditions, especially the post-stressed
(=post-lax and post-tense) ones; consequently, compiling percentages of /f/
selection for each condition on a subject to subject basis was problematic.65
Therefore, data was pooled across all subjects, as in Experiment 2. The number
65 As discussed elsewhere in this paper, if a child (as was often the case) only deleted a consonant
once for a particularly category – post-lax (fk), for example – then, whichever consonant was
selected on that occasion would have to be coded as the preference (/f/ over /k/, or vice-versa) at
the rate of 100% (1/1), clearly too small a token sample to be valid input to an analysis of variance.
158
of times /f/ was selected as a single intervocalic consonant across all subjects was
divided by the number of times in which reduction took place for a particular
cluster and prosodic condition across all subjects. Above each bar the ratio from
which the percentage is drawn is recorded in the graph below.

prosodic contexts.
Figure 11 shows the percentages of all deletions in which /f/ was retained from
/fk/ and /kf/ clusters across all prosodic categories. As in the previous
experiment (Experiment 2), the strongest effect on consonant selection appears to

condition. When the syllable following the cluster is stressed, the /k/ is chosen
from /fk/ clusters, and the /f/ from /kf/ clusters, almost without exception.
However, when the syllable preceding the cluster is stressed (post-lax and post-
tense categories), there is no longer a tendency to preserve C1 over C2. To test
this observation statistically, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was set up on stimuli
in both stress conditions with the test variable the choice of C1 or C2. This test
should determine whether there is a significant effect of the position of each
consonant in the cluster in the input, independent of segment. But since the
predictions as to which consonant will be favored depend, crucially, on which
syllable is stressed, stress was held constant across each of two separate tests.
The results show that when stress precedes the cluster, there is no effect of
position: neither C1 nor C2 is preferred to the other, signed ranked sum S+ = 25,
p=.838. However, when stress follows the cluster, there is a highly significant
effect of order, p=.001, with C2 being preserved more often.
Given the fact that position of consonant does not seem to drive reduction
choice in the post-stressed conditions (post-tense/post-lax), it remains to be
determined what does. Figure 11 shows an overall preference for /f/ over /k/ in
the post-stressed contexts in both cluster orders. To test the significance of this
trend, another Wilcoxon test was performed, this time with consonant (/f/ vs. /k/)
as the test variable. A preference was found for /f/ over /k/, p= .046. Finally,
160
while it is evident that /f/ is more frequent in the post-lax condition than in the
post-tense condition in both sequences /fk/ and /kf/, this difference is not
statistically significant, on the basis of a chi-squared analysis, p=.197.
Summing up the results for /fk/ and /kf/ reduction, when the cluster
precedes a stressed syllable, it is the position of the consonants that determines
which gets preserved (C2 over C1), with segment type playing no evident role.
However, when the cluster follows a stressed syllable, it is the segment that
influences the results (/f/ chosen over /k/), with position playing little role. Next I
turn to reduction results for /mk/ and /km/ clusters. These are given in the figure
below, with % /m/ selection as dependent variable.

Figure 12. Percentage of /m/ selection in /mk/ and /km/ clusters across varying
prosodic contexts.
From the figure we see that /m/ is retained only before stressed syllables and
from /km/ clusters, and in this case, at the rate of 71%. Similar to the results for
stop-fricative clusters, it appears that order (C1 vs. C2) determines selection when
the syllable following the cluster is stressed, while when the syllable preceding
the cluster is stressed (post-lax & post-tense categories), consonant type predicts
preservation pattern, with the stop selected over the nasal 100% of the time.66
7.5.1.2 Discussion – reduction results
For the stimuli in which the cluster precedes a stressed syllable, the significant
effect of position (=C1 vs. C2) is consistent with reduction results from Experiment
2 involving s-stop and stop-s clusters. Virtually independent of cluster type, C2
is retained when the second syllable is stressed. Because reference is made to
order of segments in the input, I assume that the active constraint belongs to the
faithfulness family. And because the favored consonant is the one belonging to
the stressed syllable in the input, I assume that the relevant faithfulness
constraint is prosodic in nature. The constraint was provisionally formalized as
66 There were also cases of apparent coalescence in which /km/ or /mk/ emerged as [p]. These
were not included in the tallies above. In total, /mk/ was realized as [p] 3 times: 2 times in the
post-unstressed context and 1 time in the post-tense context. Likewise, /km/ was realized as [p]
two times, once in the post-unstressed context and once in the post-tense context.
162
HEAD-MAX, and its hypothesized interaction with sonority constraint *ONSET-
FRICATIVE is shown in (9).
(9) HEAD-MAX >> *ONSET-FRICATIVE
/Vk.fV'/ HEAD-MAX *ONSET-FRICATIVE
La. [V.fV'] *
b. [V.kV'] *!
Note that it is not HEAD-MAX per se that results in deletion of one of the two
consonants. As is argued in the case of word-initial cluster reduction (see, for
example, Gnanadesikan, 2004), an independent markedness constraint (such as
SYLLABLE-CONTACT or NOCODA) drives deletion in the intervocalic context. The
choice of which consonant to delete is made on the basis of the ranking of HEAD-
MAX over the margin constraint, *ONSET-FRICATIVE.
As to the role of sonority, results are more difficult to interpret. It is
suggestive that /m/ as C2 is preserved a little less often in this environment than
is the /f/ or /k/ as C2 of other clusters, as can be seen in the table below.
163
Figure 13. Rate at which C2 is preserved when cluster precedes a stressed
syllable.
While for every cluster type C2 is chosen far more often than C1, there appears to
be an interaction between order (C1 or C2) and cluster type. The raw numbers
across all subjects were used as input to a chi-square analysis that compared
choice of C1 vs. C2 across all clusters, as shown below:

stop. *ONSET-NASAL may accommodate the difference in C2 preservation patterns
among the clusters tested above. Nonetheless, it is still evident that faithfulness
takes precedence over markedness the majority of the time, given the 71% rate at
which the nasal is retained in place of the stop in /km/ clusters.
This result poses a question that was raised by the results of the previous
experiment as well. Why should such a faithfulness constraint (i.e. HEAD-MAX)
predominate so exhaustively (there seems to be neither variation between
subjects nor much variation within subjects)? The answer may be that the
competing markedness constraints (=margin constraints) are relatively low
ranked in the children's developing grammars. On the basis of the results of the
pretest for eligibility that I performed on all subjects, I make the assumption that
input singleton nasals are produced faithfully in onset and coda positions (i.e.
word initially and word finally), just like stops and fricatives are. This indicates
that general FAITH outranks *ONSET-NASAL, etc. Recall that we see emergence of
the unmarked effects caused by the margin-constraint hierarchy in word-initial
position (Gnanadesikan, 2004), an environment where HEAD-MAX is satisfied
equally by both consonants. However, in medial position, assuming the two
consonants are in two different syllables, preservation of one will satisfy HEAD-
MAX while preservation of the other will violate it. Therefore, the reason why
sonority fails to be reflected in the choice of consonant to preserve when the
165
syllable following the cluster is stressed is that the constraints *ONSET-FRICATIVE
(and, usually, *ONSET-NASAL) are buried too low in the constraint hierarchy:
below general FAITH, and thus, presumably, below the more specific prosodic
faithfulness constraint.

/Vk.fV’/ HEAD-MAX IDENT *ONSET-FRICATIVE
c. [V.kV’] *!
Ld. [V.fV’] *
By virtue of the faithful production of fricatives in other places of the word, we
can assume that general faithfulness constraints, such as IDENT outrank the
margin constraint prohibiting a fricative from onset position. We also need to
assume that if the specific (prosodic) faithfulness constraint isn’t ranked above
the general, one, it is at least no lower ranked.67 In this way, we see how HEAD-
MAX makes the crucial determination about which consonant to preserve – stop
or fricative - independent of its manner of articulation.
67 Ultimately, some mechanism must prevent the general faithfulness constraint from getting
higher up in the rankings than the specific faithfulness constraint. One idea is to assume that the
specific faithfulness constraint starts out higher ranked than the more general one; an alternative
is that a bias is built into the learning algorithm by which the more specific constraint is
promoted more rapidly. Frequency-driven algorithms (along the lines of Boersma, 1997) make
the opposite prediction: since the forms which violate the specific faithfulness constraint
represent a subset of those which violate the general faithfulness constraint, if frequency alone
drives constraint demotion/promotion, then the general faithfulness constraint is predicted to
surpass the specific one, unless the specific one has a head start (see Tessier, 2006).
166
When the first syllable is stressed, the role of position (C1 vs. C2) – and
thus of prosodic faithfulness - is, curiously, absent in this experiment. This
finding differs from that of Experiment 2 in which there was what appeared to be
a preference for retaining C1 when syllable 1 was stressed. Here what matters is
the consonant, with /f/ preserved more frequently than /k/ from /fk/ and /kf/
clusters, and /k/ preserved consistently over /m/ in /km/ and /mk/ clusters.
Furthermore, there was no statistical difference between rate of fricative
preservation between post-lax and post-tense conditions, as was found for
Experiments 1 and 2, although the trend is the same. Below I suggest a number
of reasons why these clusters might have produced different results. Then I
comment on possible differences between the two prosodic environments
(cluster follows stress/cluster precedes stress) that may account for the consonant
selection results from experiments 2 and 3.
First, the fact that in post-stress position /f/ was preferred to /k/ overall
may be, in part, a result of the constraint FAITH-LABIAL. Results from a
longitudinal study of cluster reduction (Jongstra, 2003) show a preference for
preserving labial consonants, even when sonority is at stake. Other papers that
argue for the existence of such a constraint are Barlow (2001) and Pater & Barlow
167
(2003).68
If this constraint is ranked above the relevant sonority constraints (e.g.
*ONSET-FRICATIVE), then /f/ will be preserved more often than /k/, independent of
the order of the two consonants in the input.69
Another factor that may have acted as a confound in this study was the
relative markedness of the consonant /k/. The fronting of velar stops is a
common process in phonological development and is well documented in the
acquisition literature (e.g. Bernhardt & Stemberger, 1998; Ingram, 1989; Stoel-
Gammon & Dunn, 1985). Furthermore, it appears to affect initial position (and,
therefore, onsets) more often than final position (=codas). Of the children tested
in this experiment, six substituted /t/ for /k/ at least a couple of times, and three
did so regularly, always in onset position. In order for such a substitution to take
place, a constraint against /k/ (or against a [k] onset) must outrank the
appropriate IDENT constraint. In the context of reduction, assuming it is a higher
ranking markedness constraint that motivates reduction, the selection of the
consonant other than /k/ in this position will simply require that the constraint
against velars (or velar onsets) be ranked higher than the other markedness
68 The fact that this constraint does not appear to play a role in results in the post-unstressed
syllable case is interesting. In this case, positional faithfulness seems to take precedence over the
other kind of special faithfulness: faithfulness to place. I don't have an argument for why
prosodic faith would be privileged over place faith.
69 FAITH-LABIAL might also be expected to choose /m/ over /k/ in /mk/ or /km/ clusters. The fact
that /k/ is chosen much more often may be a factor of the nasal - as a sonorant - being a poor
onset. Once again this asymmetry may be a reflection of the closer sonority distance between a
stop and a fricative than between a stop and a nasal.

constraints (onset/coda sonority constraints, faithfulness etc.). This may
represent, once again, an emergence of the unmarked effect in that even children
who do not exhibit overt evidence of velar fronting and thus of activity of
*K(ONSET), when forced to choose, will select the non-velar onset over the velar
one.

*CC is an abbreviation for whatever markedness constraint outlaws the medial
cluster, SYLLABLE CONTACT, for example. The constraint ranking above represents
a possible grammar of a child who under normal circumstances tolerates velars
in onset as well as coda position. Fronting does not occur because IDENT
outranks the markedness constraint against /k/ onsets. Only when a choice must
be made between two consonants is the markedness constraint against velars
active.70 Between the two consonants, labial and velar, the labial place of
articulation tends to be less marked in the developing phonologies of children
acquiring English. The fact that the markedness of /k/ appears to play no role in

at length in, among others, Gnanadesikan (2004).

the /mk/ and /km/ clusters in post-stressed position must be indication that
*ONSET-NASAL is higher ranked than *K[ONSET]. This is shown in the tableau

Even if the markedness of a /k/ as an onset and the pressure to preserve labials
explains the general preference for /f/ and the failure to find an effect of HEAD-
MAX when the syllable preceding the cluster is stressed, we still need to explain
why these confounds are not present when the syllable following the cluster is
stressed. This finding reinforces the observation made at the end of the last
experiment, where prosodic faithfulness appeared to be stronger in the stressed
syllable following the cluster than in the stressed syllable preceding the cluster.
Put a different way, it was more important to preserve the element of a stressed
syllable when it was in onset position (or initial position) than when it was in
coda position (or final position). A possible formalization of this difference is
given in the next section.
170
7.5.1.3 Asymmetries in prosodic faithfulness
In this section I offer a couple of alternative explanations for the noted
asymmetry between preserving C1 when the syllable preceding the cluster is
stressed and preserving C2 when the syllable following the cluster is stressed.
Experiment 2 found a tendency to preserve the consonant of the stressed syllable
in both cases, but a stronger one when C2 was stressed. Experiment 3 found no
effect of being part of the stressed syllable when syllable 1 was stressed, but an
effect analogous to that found in Experiment 2 when C2 was stressed. The
difference between these two environments can be framed in terms of the
syllabic position of the consonant in question: either onset or coda or,
alternatively, its position on the right or left edge of some constituent.
Suggestions of ways to account for this asymmetry are elaborated below.
7.5.1.3.1 onset /coda asymmetry
Given the input /VC1.C2V/, assumed to possess syllable structure in addition to
stress, consonant 1 is a coda and consonant 2 is an onset. As part of a stressed
syllable, the fact that C2 survives more often than does C1 may simply be a
reflection of the greater prominence afforded onsets compared to codas (e.g.
Beckman, 1998). HEAD-MAX will then have to be relativized further to onset
position, as below:
(14) HEAD-MAX[ONSET]: every element of the onset of the stressed syllable in the
input must appear in the output.
171
Assuming that there is no analogous faithfulness constraint relativized to coda
position, we arrive at the expected result, with C2 being selected more of the time
when the cluster precedes a stressed syllable than C1 when the cluster follows a
stressed syllable.
7.5.1.3.2 OI-Contiguity[σ
σ
σ
σ]
By specifying the domain of the contiguity constraint as being that of the syllable,
we can account for the stressed-based asymmetry described above. The relevant
constraint (taken from Lamontagne, 1996) and a discussion of its potential effects
are given below.
(15) CONTIGUITY[D]: For some domain D within S2, all correspondents βδ in D
must be contiguous. Where D = {Syllable, Foot, PrWd, etc.}
This constraint, applied to the present case, would have to require that within
each output, the syllable adjacency of segments be evaluated with respect to the
input. Therefore, assuming that the intervocalic C is in the onset of the second
syllable in the child's output, the above constraint will be respected if the
consonant preserved is the second of the input consonants and violated if the
chosen consonant is the first of the input consonants, as in (17) below.
(16) Violations of OI-CONTIGUITY[σ]:
/VspV/ OI-CONTIGUITY[σ]:
a. V.sV Violated
Lb. V.pV Satisfied
172
In tableau (16), candidate (a) violates OI-CONTIGUITY[σ] for the second syllable in
the output, in which the two segments are not contiguous in the input. The first
syllable incurs no violation of OI-CONTIGUITY[σ] because it contains only a vowel.
Candidate (b) in which the /p/ is preserved satisfies the constraint in the domain
of syllable 2 as well as the domain of syllable 1 because the two segments are
adjacent in the input. 71
OI-CONTIGUITY[σ] makes no reference to stress in the input or output.
Therefore, if the consonant in post-stress position is ambisyllabic in the output,
there is no reason to assume any preference for preserving C1 or C2, since OI-
CONTIGUITY[σ] is violated equally in both. The result is that in the post-stress
position, the order of the consonants in the input should play no role in the
choice of which one to retain. This is consistent with the results for Experiment
3, described in this chapter, however, not with the results discussed in the
preceding chapter. Experiment 2 found evidence of a preference for retaining C1
when the cluster followed a stressed syllable. In order to explain this result, we
would need something more than the contiguity constraint as currently defined.
One idea would be to further relativize the constraint to a stressed syllable.
Besides the formulation of the constraints involved, the contiguity account differs
71 Crosslinguistically with respect to cluster avoidance, C1 is deleted more frequently than C2.
Universal syllabification constraints combined with syllable-specific contiguity is one
explanation for such a preference (see Pater, 1997 for use of CONTIGUITY and Wilson, 1999, for a
different approach).
173
from the HEAD-FAITHFULNESS account in that it does not need to assume syllable
structure in the input.
7.5.2 Order of acquisition
7.5.2.1 Results
Since the experimental design I use is not longitudinal, order of acquisition can
only be inferred by comparing different clusters in terms of percentage of faithful
production. The fact that a cluster of a certain type or in a certain position is, on
the whole, more faithfully produced than another, permits me to draw
conclusions about the activity of particular constraints in phonological
acquisition. The constraints I focus on in this part of the investigations are, once
again, SYLLABLE-CONTACT and STRESS-TO-WEIGHT.
The first results reported concern the effect of cluster type, that is, whether
or not some consonant sequences are produced more faithfully than others. In
order to be included in an ANOVA, the subject had to have sufficient data for
each condition (e.g. post-lax /fk/, post-unstressed /mk/). The criterion used to
assess whether sufficient data had been collected was a minimum of 3 recorded
responses from each of the 12 categories
174
On average, each child produced 75 tokens.72
Four children were eliminated
because they failed to meet criterion. This brought the total number of subjects
down to thirteen for this part of the analysis. Because the interest in this section
is in markedness of the different clusters, independent of prosodic context, the
three contexts (post-lax, post-tense, post-unstressed) were collapsed for each
cluster type and totals by cluster are shown in Figure 14 - averaged across
subjects.
The dependent variable below is calculated as number of faithful
productions divided by total number of times each cluster was attempted. The
criterion for being coded as faithful was that two discrete segments be produced
(an affricate was insufficient) and that no featural change beyond place of
articulation and voicing occur to either of the two consonants. The basis for
these criteria was provided in Chapter 6 in the discussion of the previous
experiment's data analysis. Examples of errors are given below:
(17) Errors
a. fk > kf (metathesis)
b. fk > st (change in place of articulation)
c. km > kf (change in manner of articulation)
d. mk > k (deletion)
72 This number exceeds the number of stimuli because children were prompted to repeat each
target word twice.
175
Figure 14. Percentage of faithful production of clusters by cluster sequence.
Because prosody was not a concern in this part of the analysis, prosodic
distinctions have been collapsed. The percentage for each cluster represents the
percentage for each prosodic condition for each cluster averaged across all
children. We can see from the figure that /fk/ and /kf/ are produced almost
equally as faithfully, while /mk/ does better overall than /km/. As for the other
comparisons, /kf/ does better than /km/, while /fk/ is produced more faithfully on
the whole than /mk/. To determine whether any of these trends are statistically
significant, a 2 x 2 x 3 repeated measures ANOVA was performed; with factors
prosody, sonority contour and presence of nasal.

Results showed no main effect of sonority, and the effect of having a nasal as a

was also a significant effect of prosody, F(2, 11)=10.149, p=.001. No interactions
were significant. The test for a sonority effect compared clusters in which
sonority fell between coda and onset (unmarked) and those in which sonority
rose between coda and onset (marked). And since additional comparisons were
addressed, such as that between /mk/ and /fk/ and between /km/ and /kf/.
further ANOVAs were performed on subsets of the data.
A 2 x 3 ANOVA with prosody and sonority as factors was carried out on
/km/ and /kf/ data. This analysis revealed a marginal effect of sonority,
F(1,12)=5.011, p=.045 in addition to prosody, F(2,11)=4.392, p=.024, with no
interactions. An additional 2 x 3 ANOVA with the same factors was performed
on /mk/ and /km/ cluster data. Results indicate no effect of sonority, but the
usual main effect of prosody F(2, 11)= 9.343, p=.001 and no interactions.
In the second part of the analysis, the criterion for being considered
faithful was the mere absence of deletion, i.e., the presence of two segments or
not. This analysis focused on the manipulation involving prosodic environment
177
of the cluster. In Figure 5 cluster type is collapsed and averages are given per

7.5.2.2 Discussion
The results from the order of acquisition data analysis show a rather weak role
for sonority. Contrary to expectations, the clusters that represented sonority
drops between the two heterosyllabic consonants did not turn out to be
produced significantly more faithfully than those that represented sonority rises,
although the trend appears to go in the right direction. Neither did /mk/ clusters
perform better than /fk/ clusters; the only significant trend that conformed to
predictions made by SYLLABLE-CONTACT was the higher degree of faithfulness of
/kf/ clusters compared to /km/ clusters. Below I offer explanations for why
sonority effects may have effectively been overridden by other competing
markedness constraints.
First, the fact that /km/ clusters are licit in English, even if marginal could,
in part, explain the failure for /mk/ to be preferred to /km/. While /km/ clusters
violate SYLLABLE-CONTACT, /mk/ clusters violate a markedness constraint against
180
non-homorganic nasal-stop clusters. This constraint could offset the greater
markedness of /km/ on account of SYLLABLE-CONTACT. 73
The failure of /fk/ clusters to be produced more reliably than /kf/ clusters
may be influenced by the marginality of /k/ as an onset, in addition to the fact
that the consonants are too close in sonority to permit a visible effect (see
discussion in Chapter 6 regarding Experiment 2 results). In the latter case, then
we may need to consider that fricatives and stops, while adjacent on the sonority
scale, are actually closer in sonority than are fricatives and nasals, given the more
substantial difference found between stop-fricative (kf) and stop-nasal (km)
clusters.
With regards to the prosody manipulation, results point once again to a
role for STRESS-TO-WEIGHT: across all cluster types, deletion occurs least often in
the post-lax condition. The assumption here is that rather than a faithfulness
constraint blocking the markedness constraint against clusters, a prosodic
markedness constraint does the job, as shown below.
73 It is of note that children produce intervocalic clusters such as /fk/ and /kf/ as reliably as they
do given the lexical infrequency of these clusters. Even /mk/ clusters are faithful over 60% of the
time. It is possible that children are assisted in the case in which the two consonants are divided
by a syllable boundary by the appearance of the same sequences across morpheme and word
boundaries.

The tableau in (20) represents a grammar in which a marked structure emerges,
not under pressure from a faithfulness constraint, but under pressure from a
higher ranked markedness constraint. When the vowel preceding the cluster is
tense, the cluster is reduced on account of *CC, that is, whatever markedness
constraint disfavors the cluster, assumed in these studies to be SYLLABLE
CONTACT. However, when the stressed vowel is lax, both consonants are
preserved in order to satisfy STRESS-TO-WEIGHT (and ONSET and
*AMBISYLLABICITY). Once again, alternative rankings will naturally result in
symmetry (clusters being deleted in both prosodic contexts or clusters appearing
faithfully in both prosodic contexts); however, the result of these experiments
indicates that the opposite does not ensue: an asymmetry in which clusters occur
following a stressed syllable with a tense vowel, but not a stressed syllable
possessing a lax vowel.
Another result to note is the difference between post-tense and post-
unstressed conditions. In this experiment, post-tense clusters were produced
182
more faithfully on the whole than post-unstressed ones. The constraint driving
such an effect may be WEIGHT-TO-STRESS. This constraint is defined below:
(21) WEIGHT-TO-STRESS: stress heavy syllables
I assume here that a word in which the initial syllable ends in a coda and does
not receive stress will incur a violation of WEIGHT-TO-STRESS.

The grammar in (22) is, in a certain respect, the opposite of that in (20). Here,
FAITH outranks the markedness constraint against clusters, so in the default case,
the cluster emerges faithfully (see 22a). However, since WEIGHT-TO-STRESS
outranks FAITH, the cluster is not realized when the preceding syllable is
unstressed (see 22d).74
7.6 Conclusion and follow-up
This experiment, like the preceding ones, tested predicted prosodic and cluster
type asymmetries in medial cluster reduction and production, expanding on the
74 An alternative explanation for what appears to be a post-stressed vs. post-unstressed
asymmetry is positional faithfulness. As part of a preceding stressed syllable, C1 is protected by
HEAD FAITHFULNESS. In the post-unstressed condition, C1 is part of an unstressed syllable and
protected, thus, by no special faithfulness constraints.
183
previous inventory of medial clusters under investigation. In terms of reduction
patterns, we find that the position of the consonants (as the first or second in the
intervocalic cluster) plays a strong, and perhaps, singular role in determining
which of the two consonants is retained when the cluster precedes a stressed
syllable in the input. In almost every case and across all children, C2 is retained,
independent of its segmental features. To account for this result – present also in
Experiment 2 - I have argued for the existence of an input-output faithfulness
constraint that selects the consonant that is part of the stressed syllable in the
adult output, i.e. the input to the child’s grammar. The strength of this constraint
appears to outweigh markedness constraints belonging to the margin hierarchy,
in addition to other faithfulness constraints shown elsewhere to be pertinent to
consonant selection (e.g. FAITH-LABIAL). The constraint responsible for this effect
was defined provisionally as HEAD-MAX and requires simply that segments
present in the stressed syllable of the input be present also in the output. It
assumes the presence of syllable structure in the input.
However, an asymmetry that was somewhat evident in Experiment 2 is
more visible in Experiment 3: consonants that are clearly part of the stressed
syllable in the input are NOT preserved uniformly when they are codas rather
than onsets (that is, when the syllable preceding the cluster is stressed rather
than the syllable following the cluster). In order to account for this asymmetry,
184
we can consider a HEAD-MAX constraint that is further positionally relativized to
the onset, as discussed in 7.5.1.3.1.
There was little evidence found in this experiment for the effect of STRESS-
TO-WEIGHT and *CODA-STOP on preservation rates in the post-lax vs. post-tense
contexts. Finally, it was argued that the general preference for labials (FAITH-
LABIAL) and avoidance of velars in onset position (*K-ONSET) may have been
behind the general tendency towards preserving /f/ over /k/, at least in the post-
stress contexts.
With regard to the order of acquisition results, there remains strong
support for constraints regulating interactions between stress and weight. The
fact that the post-lax condition resulted in higher rates of cluster production than
in any of the other conditions is evidence for the role of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT. There
was also a tendency among children in this experiment to delete less often in a
/CC/ sequence following a tense stressed vowel than following an unstressed
vowel. This may be the effect of the constraint WEIGHT-TO-STRESS, which
demands that an unstressed syllable be light (i.e. coda-less).
As far as sonority effects are concerned, the results of this experiment, as
those of the last, provide little new evidence for the role of SYLLABLE CONTACT in
driving cluster acquisition, with the possible exception of the more faithful
production of /kf/ clusters compared to /km/ clusters. I discussed the possibility
185
that effects of SYLLABLE-CONTACT are masked by other markedness constraints
preferring clusters that simultaneously do worse on SYLLABLE CONTACT.
The next experiment resembles Experiment 1 in that it compares
production rates of clusters in initial and medial condition. This time the clusters
examined involve /s/ and /z/ and a following stop, nasal, and glide. All the
medial clusters have /s/ as the first consonant and a labial as the second in an
effort to control for effects of markedness constraints other than sonority, which
were thought to have potentially affected results in this last experiment.
186
CHAPTER 8
EXPERIMENT 4
POSITIONAL AND SEGMENTAL ASYMMETRIES IN INITIAL AND
MEDIAL /SC/ CLUSTERS
8.1 Introduction
The focus of this next experiment is on initial – medial asymmetries in the
acquisition of /sC/ clusters in English. The goal is to follow up on the findings
from Experiment 1 that addressed SONORITY SEQUENCING and SYLLABLE CONTACT.
Experiment 1 compared the production of stop-liquid to s-stop clusters in both
initial and medial position. An interaction between cluster-type and position
was found, with stop-liquid clusters produced more faithfully than s-stop
clusters in initial position, while in medial position, the two clusters were
produced with more or less equivalent accuracy. I interpreted this as activity of
sonority constraints governing two adjacent consonants, described as follows.
In word-initial position, as complex onsets, stop-liquids are unmarked
compared to s-stops by SONORITY SEQUENCING. This is because the former cluster
involves a substantial rise in sonority between C1 and C2, while the latter
constitutes a drop. In medial position, on the other hand, two adjacent
consonants can be divided between two syllables, and since s-stops make better
187
heterosyllabic clusters than stop-liquids (by SYLLABLE CONTACT), the preference
for stop-liquids over s-stops is, in effect, wiped out in this position.
In Experiment 1, no significant preference for s-stop clusters over stop-
liquid clusters was found in intervocalic position because syllabic affiliation
could not be controlled for. Intervocalic stop-liquid clusters are more likely than
s-stop clusters to be complex onsets both because they are more marked than s-
stop clusters as heterosyllabic sequences and because they are less marked than
s-stop clusters as complex onsets. The predictions and findings from Experiment
1 are reviewed schematically below ( “>” stands for “preferred over”)

In the discussion of the results from Experiment 1, it was noted that one stage of
acquisition that would allow for a more direct comparison across medial clusters
188
(on the basis of SYLLABLE-CONTACT) is one in which clusters are prohibited
completely word initially. Therefore, those clusters produced intervocalically
could safely be assumed to be heterosyllabic. In Experiment 1, among those
subjects who reduced virtually all initial clusters (>80%), s-stop clusters were
produced more often than stop-liquid clusters intervocalically in three of the four
subjects. This observation suggests that sonority can constrain permissible
heterosyllabic clusters in addition to initial clusters in intermediate stages of
phonological development. However, a focus on medial clusters that are
unambiguously heterosyllabic would provide a more direct means of
ascertaining whether SYLLABLE-CONTACT plays a role in medial cluster
acquisition.
To this end, in part, the next experiment (Experiment 4) broadens the
inventory of /sC/ clusters to include s-nasals and s-glides, in addition to s-stop
clusters. In medial position, /z/ is used in place of /s/ in order to promote a
syllable division between the two consonants (zb/p clusters being illicit in word-
initial position and, hence, as complex onsets). For by forcing all of these clusters
to be heterosyllabic word medially (as in Experiment 3), we can facilitate
predictions based on SYLLABLE-CONTACT. In general, the medial clusters that
constitute the largest (positive) sonority difference between C1 and C2 should be
acquired earlier.
189
(3) Sonority scale assumed
stop < fricative < nasal < liquid < glide < vowel

Besides testing further the effects of SYLLABLE-CONTACT by varying the sonority
of C2 of the z-initial cluster word medially, the choice of the analogous word-
initial /sC/ clusters will permit an assessment of the extent to which these clusters
behave uniformly in initial position. This comparison follows up on the question
as to whether all /sC/ clusters or only s-stop clusters are headed by an s-adjunct
and will be discussed further in 8.2.
Since the first three experiments have already established an effect of
stress and preceding vowel quality on the tendency to retain both consonants
intervocalically, I do not perform the same manipulation in this experiment. I
also focus on the relative markedness of the clusters themselves and do not study
reduction patterns, i.e., choice of consonant to retain in the case of deletion.
8.2 Hypotheses
As discussed with regard to Experiment 1, the existence of *COMPLEX and
NOCODA predicts a straightforward positional asymmetry in which clusters are
produced word medially but not word initially, since the two adjacent
intervocalic consonants can be part of two different syllables.
(4) a. word-initial: /CC/ → [C] *COMPLEX >> FAITH
b. word-medial /VCCV/ → [VC.CV] FAITH >> NOCODA
190
On the other hand, word-initial /sC/ sequences constitute either complex onsets
or an adjunct followed by onset. Furthermore, since sonority makes different
predictions about the markedness of /sC/ clusters depending on whether they are
tauto- or hetero-syllabic, we expect there to be an interaction between cluster
type and position. For example, /sC/ sequences that are least marked as complex
onsets (/sw/, for example, because the rise in sonority from C1 to C2 is the
greatest), are the most marked as heterosyllabic clusters by SYLLABLE-CONTACT.
(5) s2w5 = rise (+3) s2p1 = fall (-1)
a. SSP: sonority should rise from C1 to C2 ; therefore #sw > #sp/
b. SYLLABLE CONTACT: sonority should fall from C1 to C2 ; therefore, s.p > s.w
To sum up, the predicted interaction between cluster and position is based on the
idea that in initial position, C2 is better if it is more sonorous, while in medial
position, it is better if it is less sonorous.
Focusing specifically on acquisition order in medial position, SYLLABLE CONTACT
predicts that /zb/ will be preferred to /zm/, which will be preferred to /zw/.
Justification for these predictions is based on the permutation of FAITH with the
following fixed ranking of constraints:
(6) SYLL-CON > -2 >> SYLL-CON > -1 >> SYLL-CON > 1 >> SYLL-CON > 2
The following tableaux illustrate grammars varying on permitted clusters.

The four tableaux above show 4 different permutations of FAITH with respect to
constraints in the SYLLABLE-CONTACT hierarchy. In the first grammar (7), none of
the clusters are produced faithfully, due to the low ranking of FAITH. In the
second grammar (8), only /zb/ clusters are permitted, and in the third example
(9), /zb/ and /zm/ clusters surface, while /zw/ clusters are reduced. In the fourth
example (10), all clusters are allowed because FAITH outranks all of the relevant
SYLLABLE CONTACT constraints.
Because of the fixed ranking of the SYLLABLE CONTACT constraints, certain
implications emerge. For example, the faithful production of /zm/ clusters
implies the presence of /zb/ clusters, while the faithful realization of /zw/ clusters
implies the realization of both /zm/ and /zb/ clusters. On the other hand, we
don’t predict a grammar, for example, in which /zw/ clusters are pronounced
faithfully while /zm/ and /zb/ clusters are disallowed. Therefore, even though
variation is possible on the basis of children being at different development
193
stages, we expect that, on the whole, clusters will be preferred in which the
sonority differences are greatest between C1 and C2.
Predictions for the order of acquisition of initial clusters remains
something of an open question. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis, it
has been suggested in the literature that either s-stop clusters or all /sC/ clusters
are headed by an /s/ adjunct. If we find that the order of faithful production
among these clusters is /sw/ > /sm/ > /sp/, this would seem to be evidence for
SONORITY SEQUENCING and MINIMAL DISTANCE CONSTRAINTS, while not necessarily
for or against *ADJUNCT. 75 76 If we find all /sC/ clusters to be produced or reduced
relatively uniformly in word-initial position, this may indicate that all /sC/
clusters are headed by an /s/ adjunct, independent of manner of articulation of
C2.
75 The constraint OCP[-cont] which prohibits a sequence of two continuants in onset position (e.g.
McCarthy, 1986; Morelli, 1999; Yip, 1988) is violated by an [sw] onset, but satisfied by [#sm] and
[#sp]. So, this at least allows in theory for the existence of a developmental stage in which the
opposite cluster inventory is favored with respect to that favored by SONORITY SEQUENCING.
Furthermore, under the premises of Sonority Dispersion theory (Clements, 1990), there is no
difference in preference between /smV/ and /swV/ clusters, as in neither does the sonority
distance between first and second elements equal the sonority distance between second and third
elements.
76 We aren’t bound to assuming an absence of uniformity in developing grammars in terms of the
structure of /sC/ clusters (see, for example, Goad & Rose, 2004). Some children could produce all
/sC/ clusters or a subset thereof as adjunct-initial, while others could prohibit all adjunct-initial
sequences from their grammars. Because there is no perceivable surface difference between these
two types of /sC/ sequences, conclusions will ultimately be based on inventories, or, as in the case
of this experimental design, overall performance on different types of /sC/ clusters.

8.3 Methods
8.3.1 Subjects
Subjects were 19 children, ages 1;11 to 3;1. They were interviewed in homes or at
daycare centers. The average age of the children at the time of testing was 2;7.
None of the children had any known speech or hearing disorders. All subjects
were native English speakers.
8.3.2 Stimuli
The stimuli used were novel names consisting of two syllables and either an
initial or medial cluster. In the initial condition the clusters used were /sp/, /sm/
and /sw/. Medial clusters were, analogously, /zb/, /zm/, and /zw/. In the initial-
cluster condition, the vowel following the cluster was one of [i], [w], [e] or [o],
while the intervocalic consonant was [d], [z], [n] or [g]. Words ended in [n], [c],
[i] or [o]. In the medial-cluster condition, stimuli began with [t], [g], [k], or [s].
Vowels preceding the cluster were [ej], [i], [w], and [e], and final segments were
[n], [i], and [c]. Stress fell on the first syllable in all cases. There were a total of
four stimuli per condition. Examples of the stimuli are given in the table below.
Table 16. Examples of stimuli in Experiment 4.
C2 = p C2 = m C2 = w

195
In addition to the test stimuli, a few additional stimuli were included in the
experiment in order to make the task less intimidating to subjects. These were
real names that are relatively common and, hence, likely to have been heard by
children (= Clifford, Clara, Steven, Spot). While all of these stimuli contained
initial clusters, they were not included in the coding of the results, but were only
intended to break up the novel words with familiar ones.77
8.3.3 Procedure
Stimuli were prerecorded on a Tascam CD RW-700 recorder by a female
colleague of the experimenter. Sampling rate was 44.1khz and the microphone
used was the MicroMic II C420 by AKG. The files were extracted into Praat
4.2.34 (Boersma, 2004) and a separate .wav file was created for each stimulus.
Each file was then linked to an animal animation that had been downloaded into
Powerpoint. Four versions of the experiment were set up, which differed on the
order in which the slides were shown. Subjects were run on alternate versions.
The experiment was performed in all cases on a laptop computer.
In the course of the experiment the child was shown slides containing one
or more animal animation. To play the name, it was necessary to click on the
image. In most cases, the experimenter manipulated the mouse; however,
sporadically, to motivate an unengaged or distracted child, the experimenter
77 It was evident that for some children elicitation on words which were completely novel made
them hesitant to respond or more likely to whisper the response.
196
would ask the child to press the button him/herself. Each name (=stimulus) was
played twice and the child was then asked to repeat it. Two elicitations per
stimulus were sought, for a total of 8 tokens for each condition (cluster X
position).
8.4 Results
Results were transcribed and coded by the author and 10-15% of the data were
subjected to independent transcription by a student in the department of
Communication Disorders at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Overall
inter-transcriber agreement for this data set was 74%. Agreement on whether or
not deletion took place occurred 89% of the time. Approximately one-third of
the cases of disagreement were based upon voicing differences.
In order to be included in the analysis, subjects had to meet the same criterion as
that used in Experiments 2 and 3: at minimum 3 tokens for each category (e.g.
initial /sp/). Only one subject failed to meet the criterion and was thus
eliminated.78 On average, subjects attempted 45 stimuli total, corresponding to
7.5 per category. A list of errors is given in (11):
78 This particular subject had failed to complete the experiment; however, this by itself would not
have resulted automatically in her being eliminated from the analysis.
197
(11) Experiment 4 errors
a. deletion (e.g. /spwnc/ → [pwnc])
b. devoicing (e.g. /gwzbi/ → [gwsbi])
c. manner feature change (C2) ( e.g. /sεzwi/ → [sεzmi])
d. place feature change (C1 or C2) (e.g. /swwdo/ → [fwwdo])
e. manner feature change (C1) (e.g. /kwzmi/ → [kwdzi])
f. coalescence (e.g. /swwdo/ → [fwdo]) - confined to word-initial position.
g. metathesis (smizc → sizmc)
The most frequent errors were of types (a), (c) and (f). The others were quite
infrequent, occurring sporadically and never consistently within one child’s
grammar.
Percentage of faithful production by position and cluster type are given in the
figure below. In order to be considered faithful, both consonants had to be
produced in the same order and position, and no changes in manner could have
occurred for either consonant. Changes in place of articulation or voicing did not
count as "unfaithful" for this purpose.
198
Figure 17. Percentage of faithful production according to type & position.
It is evident from the graph that, on the whole, medial clusters were produced
more faithfully than initial clusters. Furthermore, medial clusters seem to follow
the predicted trend, with /zb/ clusters produced the most faithfully, followed by
/zm/ clusters and finally /zw/ clusters. For initial clusters, /sw/ clusters do better
than both /sm/ and /sp/ clusters, while there is little difference between the latter
two. To evaluate these trends statistically, a 2 x 3 repeated measures ANOVA
was performed, with cluster type (s/zb vs. s/zm vs. s/zw) and position (initial vs.
medial) as factors. Results showed a main effect of position, F(1, 17)=8.838,
p=.009 and no main effect of cluster type. There was also a significant interaction
between cluster and position, F(2, 16)= 3.853, p=.031.

In order to examine the extent of the effect separately for each position,
tests were run on subsets of the data. An ANOVA was run on the initial cluster
data alone (/sp/ vs. /sm/ vs /sw/), and the overall effect did not reach significance,
F(2, 16) = 2.518, p= .096. The largest pairwise difference (that between /sm/ and
/sw/ clusters) did not reach significance either, F(1,17) = 3.941, p=.064.
Next a one-way ANOVA was performed on the set of medial cluster data
(zb vs. zm vs. zw). Again, there was no main effect of cluster. However,
pairwise comparisons revealed a nearly significant preference for /zb/ clusters to
/zw/ clusters, p=.019 (after the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons).
There were no significant differences between either /zb/ and /zm/ clusters or
between /zm/ and /zw/ clusters.
The medial clusters in this experiment are produced correctly on the
average 60% of the time. Furthermore, deletion takes place less than 25% of the
time, with change in manner articulation of C2 comprising the majority of the
remaining 15% of the FAITH violations. Because the results shown in Figure 17
consider all cases of manner feature change as being equally unfaithful, a new
comparison was done in order to assess whether feature change of C2 resulted
more often in improvement or worsening of sonority (via SYLLABLE CONTACT &
SONORITY SEQUENCING) violations. This comparison was performed separately
for initial and medial position. In medial position, C2 was changed to a
200
consonant of lesser sonority 71% of the time (calculated across all children). A
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was performed to determine whether the tendency
for sonority to fall rather than rise in C2 was different from chance. The result
was significant, Wilcoxon Statistic = 98.5, p=.031.
Word initially, the rate at which C2 became less vs. more sonorous was 50-
50, implying no effect in either direction.
8.5 Discussion of results
The fact that there was an overall significant effect of position (medial clusters
produced more faithfully than initial clusters) suggests that in general,
heterosyllabic /sC/ clusters are acquired before word-initial ones. This attests to
the later mastery of complex onsets by children acquiring English, and/or the
markedness of word-initial /sC/ clusters or some subset thereof.
Secondly, the significant interaction found between cluster type and
position offers support for the influence of sonority on the acquisition of word
initial and word medial /sC/ clusters. While /zb/ dominates /zw/ in word medial
position, in initial position, this trend is reversed. Sonority predicts precisely
such a pattern, as discussed in 8.3: /zb/ does better on SYLLABLE CONTACT than
does /zw/, while /sw/ does better on SONORITY SEQUENCING than does /sp/. The
further finding that in the medial condition, C2 became less more often than more
sonorous is further evidence for SYLLABLE CONTACT in medial cluster acquisition.
201
The differences between the medial clusters (i.e. zb > zw) on the basis of
sonority could also be framed simply in terms of margin constraints, with /b/
making a better onset than /m/, which makes a better onset than /w/, on account
of their relative sonority. However, the subjects who participated in this
experiment produced word-initial singleton /m/ as [m] and word-initial singleton
/w/ as [w] (success on the singleton consonant production pretest was a
condition for participation in the experiment). This is evidence that these
segments are permissible onsets by themselves. Constraint conjunction
involving margin constraints may, in the end, do the same work that SYLLABLE-
CONTACT does (see, for example, Baertsch, 2002); however, a comparison of such
approaches is beyond the scope of this work.
The fact that no overall difference in percentage of faithful realization is
found between /zb/ and /zm/, nor between /zm/ and /zw/ is, perhaps, not
surprising given results from the previous two experiments. It appears that it
may take a larger differential between respective violations of sonority in order
for these effects to be visible in phonological development, at least in this
experimental framework.
As we can assume intervocalic C2 to be an onset, the fact that it becomes
less sonorous more often than more sonorous when its manner of articulation
202
changes is once again importance evidence in favor of the influence of sonority
on medial cluster acquisition.79
A quite common repair that occurred exclusively in word-initial position
was coalescence. Interestingly, both within and across children, /sw/ clusters
undergo apparent coalescence more often than any other cluster: out of 27 total
cases of /f/ realization across all initial /sC/ clusters, 20 were mappings from /sw/
clusters, 7 from /sm/ clusters, and none at all from /sp/ clusters. I suggest that
this (cluster type) asymmetry in repair may interfere with the attempt to
determine the relative markedness of varying initial /sC/ clusters.
Let us suppose, for example, that the coalescence option is available to
/sw/ clusters but not to /sm/ and /sp/ clusters. This asymmetry may be a result of
the constraint IDENT(CONT), violated by the mapping of /sp/ and /sm/ to [f], but
not by the mapping of /sw/ to [f]. As long as this constraint, in addition to MAX,
outranks *COMPLEX, an asymmetry may be produced as in (12) below.
79 One might wonder why it is almost exclusively C2 that changes manner of articulation, rather
than C1. This may be an artifact of the manipulation itself: since all of the nonce names with
medial clusters contain /z/ as C1, perhaps the child learns to hold this constant, while the other
consonant-varying across stimuli- is subject to change.

This tableau simply suggests a mechanism by which word-initial /sw/ clusters
may be penalized in terms of likelihood of faithful realization if there is a repair
open to them that is not open to /sp/ and /sm/ clusters.
It notable (from figure 17) that the average difference between faithful
production rates of /sw/ vs. /sm/ clusters is numerically larger than that between
/zb/ and /zw/ clusters (55% - 35% (sw,sm) vs. 69%- 56% (zb,zw), respectively),
even though the former difference is barely significant on the basis of the
ANOVA. This suggests greater variability between children in faithful
production of different clusters in word-initial position with respect to word-
medial position. Perhaps this stems from the different structural positions that
word-initial /sC/ clusters may occupy, as complex onsets or adjunct+onset.
8.6 Conclusion and follow-up
This experiment found evidence for the predicted interaction between cluster
type and position, which highlights the importance of sonority in cluster
204
acquisition. While in initial position the clusters containing a more sonorous C2
were favored, in medial position the clusters containing a less sonorous C2 were
favored. Both the fact that medial /zb/ clusters were produced more faithfully
than medial /zw/ clusters AND the propensity for C2 to become less rather than
more sonorous in medial position when featural change occurred are indications
that less sonorous consonants are favored as onsets. The pattern in word-initial
position is somewhat less clear; however, there is a slight suggestion -although
not statistically significant- that the least marked cluster is the one in which the
sonority distance is the greatest between the two consonants (=sw). This
suggests a role for minimal sonority distance constraints.
The relevance of these results to the question of s-appendices is
questionable. Although the differences in production rates between different
initial /sC/ clusters do not reach significance, we do see hints of a pattern in
which the favored initial cluster is the one in which sonority distance is greatest
between /s/ and C2 (=/sw/). This suggests that some /sC/ clusters - at least some
of the time - are represented as complex onsets. Still, the results do not provide
evidence against adjunct-initial sequences either. Studies that take on the task of
evaluating individual initial /sC/ grammars - on the basis of a larger number of
tokens for each child for each cluster - may, in the end, be the best way of
ascertaining which grammars (and thus which constraint rankings) are attested.
205
However, the fact that there was less homogeneity across children for s-initial
clusters than for s-medial clusters suggests that there is greater variation in how
these word-initial /sC/ clusters are treated in acquisition.
The next (and last) experiment will return to the comparison performed in
Experiment 1 between /sC/ clusters and obstruent-liquid clusters. However, this
time both s-nasal and s-liquid clusters will be included, in addition to s-stop
clusters. Finally, prosody and position of the cluster will be manipulated in
order to test effects of positional faithfulness (=MAX-σ[INITIAL] and MAX-σ[HEAD]) in
order of acquisition.
206
CHAPTER 9
EXPERIMENT 5
POSITIONAL FAITHFULNESS IN CLUSTER PRODUCTION
INITIAL SYLLABLES – STRESSED SYLLABLES
9.1 Introduction / Hypotheses
Analyses of cluster simplification patterns in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 suggested a
role for positional faithfulness constraints in guiding medial consonant selection
in the case of deletion. The pattern was such that the consonant preserved was
often the one that was part of the stressed syllable in the input (= adult output
representation), in particular in the cases in which it was an onset rather than a
coda. I argued that this was evidence for a prosodic faithfulness constraint that
has the stressed syllable as its domain. I have characterized this constraint as a
type of HEAD-FAITHFULNESS that requires that the consonants present in the
stressed syllable in the input be present in the output as well.
Having advanced a claim regarding the role of prosodic faithfulness in the
choice of consonant to retain when reduction occurs, I now seek to ascertain
whether the same constraint can be found to play a role in the order of
acquisition of consonant clusters. This final experiment examines the potential
for a further asymmetry involving the rate at which clusters themselves are
produced faithfully in two prominent positions of the word: the word-initial
207
syllable and the primary stressed syllable, both of which have been argued to be
positions of privilege in the positional faithfulness literature (e.g. Alderete, 1999;
Beckman, 1998; Kager, 1999; McCarthy, 2000).
The comparisons involve (1) that between word-initial position and non-
initial position (when stress is held constant; in both positions, syllables are
stressed, e.g. brínc vs. scbrínc), and (2) that between stressed syllables and
unstressed syllables (when position is held constant; in both cases, syllables are
word initial, e.g. brínc vs. brctúnc). Taking both comparisons into consideration,
target clusters in this experiment thus appear in initial stressed syllables, medial
stressed syllables, and initial unstressed syllables. The prediction is that clusters
will be produced more faithfully on the whole in the initial stressed syllable
environment than in the medial stressed syllable environment, and more
faithfully in initial stressed syllables than in initial unstressed syllables. The
positional faithfulness constraints predicted to produce such asymmetries are
defined below:
(1) MAX-σ[HEAD]: every element of the stressed syllable of the input has a
correspondent in the output.
(2) MAX-σ[INITIAL]: every element of the initial syllable of the input has a
correspondent in the output.
These constraints, while adapted from Beckman (1998), differ substantively from
her formulations, as discussed in Chapter 2. Beckman's constraints result in the
208
maximum number of input segments possible being syllabified as part of the
stressed (or initial, respectively) syllable. Furthermore, no assumptions are
necessary regarding the presence of syllable structure in the lexical
representation. The definitions in (1) and (2) resemble more closely those of Rose
(2000) and Goad & Rose (2004). The MAX constraint has as its domain the syllable
contained in its definition (either initial or stressed). Because syllable structure is
assumed to be part of the child's input, the constraint demands not that the
stressed (or initial) syllable in the output be as large as possible, but only that the
segments present in that syllable in the input also be present in the output. I
have chosen this latter definition because it is closer to matching the definition
that I used (=HEAD-MAX) to account for medial cluster reduction facts
(preferences as to which consonant to retain, discussed in Chapters 5-7). In the
tableaux below I represent the way in which these constraints may be expected
to have an effect in an intermediate stage of acquisition.

The two forms above both contain a cluster in initial position. They differ in
whether the syllable is stressed or not. Assuming the existence of a faithfulness
209
constraint relative to the stressed syllable, an intermediate stage is predicted in
which clusters are only produced in stressed syllables.80 Once again, the claim is
not that this is a stage that all children go through, only that children are not
expected to demonstrate the opposite asymmetry: production of a marked
structure in a non-prominent position before a prominent position (when all else
is held constant). Even allowing for variation of rankings both within children
and across children, by analyzing utterances from these two experimental
conditions, we expect a bias towards the faithful production of clusters in the
more prominent of the two positions. The next tableau demonstrates the exact
analogy for initial vs. non-initial syllables, when stress is held constant.

Given the constraint ranking in (4), an intermediate stage is possible in which
onset clusters are produced in initial position, but not in medial condition.
Summing up, assuming the existence of positional faithfulness constraints
80 It's interesting that patterns of response to a stimulus such as the one in tableau (3) could
suggest a difference between the two formulations of the MAX-σ[HEAD] constraint. Beckman (1998)’s
constraint would prefer a third output candidate for the 2nd input illustrated: [bc.trú.na], since a
greater number of segments from the input are contained in the stressed syllable of the output
than in (3d). However, this constraint also violates another faithfulness constraint: IO-
CONTIGUITY. I have not come across such a repair in the data obtained in this experiment.
210
MAX-σ[HEAD] and MAX-σ[INITIAL], the prediction is that clusters that occur at the
beginning of word-initial stressed syllables should be produced with greater
overall accuracy than those occurring at the beginning of a stressed syllable in
medial position or those occurring in word-initial position in an unstressed
syllable.
The range of clusters used in this experiment are a subset of those
permitted word initially in English and include stop-liquids (e.g. bl), fricative-
liquids (e.g. fl), /s/-liquids (sl), /s/-nasals (e.g. sn), and /s/-stops (e.g. st). Because
the medial cluster manipulation involves pretonic position only (between an
unstressed syllable and a stressed syllable), these clusters are likely to be
syllabified as part of the stressed syllable – and thus as complex onsets - rather
than part of two different syllables. For if medial clusters contained a syllable
division between C1 and C2, then the prediction regarding the preference for
initial clusters over medial clusters (when stress is held constant) is
compromised. Results from earlier experiments (e.g. Experiments 1 and 4) have
shown a bias towards medial clusters over initial clusters when those medial
clusters are heterosyllabic. Therefore, given the constraints that I am testing in
this present experiment, I needed to maximize the possibility of the cluster being
tautosyllabic in both positions, not just initial.
211
9.2 Methods
9.2.1 Subjects
Subjects consisted of eighteen children between the ages of 2;3 and 3;3. Their
average age was 2;8. None of the children had any known speech or hearing
disorders. They were all interviewed at daycare centers or preschools. Four
children were tested in pairs; the rest were tested individually.81
9.2.2 Stimuli
The stimuli in this experiment were 2 or 3-syllable nonce words varying in
cluster type and in position of the cluster in the word (intervocalic vs. initial), in
addition to the stress placement (initial stress, medial stress). Clusters used were
stop-liquids (including /pr/, /pl/, /dr/, /tr/, /kl/), fricative-liquids (/fr/ and /fl/), s-
stops (/sk/, /sp/, /st/), s-nasals (/sm/ and /sn/), and s-liquids (/sl/). Specific
prosodic contexts (designated according to the syllable that the cluster begins)
included initial stressed syllables, initial unstressed syllables and medial stressed
syllables. Stimuli containing clusters in initial stressed position were two
syllables in length; the remainder of the stimuli contained three syllables. A total
of 6 stimuli were constructed for each cell of interest. Examples are given below:
81 Such a practice was encouraged at one childcare center in particular, in order to make the task
less intimidating for certain children.

9.2.3 Procedure
The pretest performed for this experiment examined only the production of the
consonants as singletons in word-initial position (as onsets).
The experimental methodology used here was adopted from Experiments 1 and
2. Children were presented with props consisting of stuffed animals, dolls and
pictures. They were engaged in a game in which the experimenter gave a name
to each figure. The child was asked to repeat it. Children were sometimes
prompted to repeat stimuli names if they spoke softly or if two children spoke at
the same time, in the cases in which a pair of children was run simultaneously.
Stimuli were generated randomly by shuffling the small cards containing each
name. In one third of the cases, data collection took longer than one session due
to the number of elicitations that I hoped to obtain from each child. In such
cases, I kept a record of which stimuli had already been recorded and sought to
elicit the remainder on the occasion of the second meeting. Experimental
sessions typically lasted around 20 minutes.

9.3 Results
The criterion for inclusion was, as usual, a minimum of 3 target productions for
each cell. The average total number of tokens produced by subjects was 99, or
approximately 6.5 per cell. All children reached the specified minimum.
However, four children were eliminated from the analysis because they failed to
produce initial unstressed syllables consistently enough. This was a particular
problem for this experiment because two thirds of the stimuli contained initial
unstressed syllables (in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 it was one third). While there is
useful information to glean from truncation as well, on account of the
comparisons being made in this experiment, it was necessary that all syllables be
produced consistently.
To be counted as faithful, deletion could not have occurred; nor could
change in manner of articulation of the consonant, with the exception of liquids
changing into glides. The graph below shows the overall proportion of faithful
clusters for each prosodic context, with cluster type collapsed across all 5 values.

It is evident that clusters were produced faithfully most often in initial-stressed
position (e.g. plúsc) followed by medial-stressed position (e.g. dcplínc). Clusters
were produced faithfully least often in initial-unstressed position (e.g. brctúnc).
A 5 x 3 repeated measures ANOVA with cluster type (stop-liquid,
fricative-liquid, /sl/, s-nasal, s-stop) and prosody (initial-stressed, initial-
unstressed, medial-stressed) as factors was performed. Results showed a strong
main effect for prosody, F(2,26)= 21.190, p < .001, no effect of cluster, and a
significant interaction between cluster and prosody, F(8,104) = 2.926, p=.005.
Planned contrasts showed a significant difference between initial-stressed and
initial-unstressed position, F(1, 13) = 34.468, p < .001, in addition to a significant

comparison for initial unstressed syllables and figure 21 represents the

While there were not substantial differences across cluster type independent of
prosody, differences emerge within each prosodic category. In the word-initial
(stressed) condition, stop-liquid clusters predominate, while in medial (stressed)
position, s-nasal and s-stop clusters are produced with a greater degree of
faithfulness. It seems that the cluster-type / prosody interaction identified in the
previous ANOVA is a product of this trend. In order to examine the interaction
further, I ran a second (2 x 5) repeated measures ANOVA, this time collapsing
two categories (initial stressed and initial unstressed) into one, thus permitting
an initial-medial comparison. Once more, there was no effect of cluster, the effect
of prosody was lost this time, but a significant interaction between cluster and
prosody remained, F(4, 52) = 3.41, p = .015. Furthermore, pairwise contrasts
showed a significant interaction between position and cluster for the stop-liquid /
s-stop pair, F(1,13)=6.16, p =.027 and for the stop-liquid and stop-nasal pair,
F(1,13)= 7.08, p=.02.
9.4 Discussion of results
9.4.1 Initial-stressed > Initial-unstressed / Medial-stressed
The greater overall faithful production of clusters in initial stressed position
when compared to those in initial unstressed position and medial stressed
position suggests a role for positional faithfulness constraints in phonological
acquisition. Tableaux (3) and (4) from this chapter were illustrations of possible
218
intermediate grammars reflective of stages in which the positional faithfulness
constraint had been promoted while the general faithfulness constraint was still
ranked below *COMPLEX.
They are reproduced as (5) and (6) below.

In (5) the two examples under comparison both occur in the word-initial syllable.
So, the fact that reduction occurs in (5d), but not in (5a) seems to be due to the
fact that the cluster belongs to a stressed syllable in the latter case. The overall
difference in percentage correct between the two conditions across the subjects of
this experiment was substantial, at 74 % (stressed) vs. 37% (unstressed). This
cannot be a result of children having truncated the initial unstressed syllable,
because these cases were not included as part of the tally. I take it to be a
219
product of positional faithfulness, in so far as there is a particular pressure to
preserve an onset cluster that is part of a stressed syllable in the adult form. A
similar argument can be made for the comparisons in (6).
9.4.2 Cluster differences
The fact that clusters of varying types were used for the positional/prosodic
comparisons under question permits an evaluation along the cluster-type
dimension as well. The only substantial difference among clusters seems to be
that between stop-liquids and all other clusters (including fricative-liquids) in the
initial-stressed condition. While we may take the higher rate of faithful
production of stop-liquid clusters as evidence consistent with the predictions of
sonority (SSP / MINIMAL DISTANCE), there is no further evidence for this constraint
among the other comparisons among clusters.
9.4.3 Interaction between cluster and prosody
The interaction found between cluster and prosody can be explained by a reverse
in trends regarding cluster markedness between initial and medial position. In
initial position, stop-liquid clusters do better than s-stop and s-nasal clusters,
while in medial position, the trend is reversed. I propose that is a consequence of
s-stop and s-nasal clusters being acceptable as heterosyllabic clusters even when
the syllable preceding the cluster is unstressed. The fact that s-stop and s-nasal
220
clusters are more likely to be heterosyllabic than other /sC/ clusters is a product
of SYLLABLE CONTACT.
The greater differential that exists between initial stressed stop-liquid clusters
and medial stressed stop-liquid clusters (i.e. 90% vs. 50%) compared to the
closeness in percentages correct in the two environments in the s-stop condition
(i.e. 70% vs. 70%) may be explained by the fact that stop-liquids are onsets in
both conditions, whereas s-nasal and s-stop clusters are often heterosyllabic in
the child productions, even when following an unstressed syllable. The fact that
the /sl/ and /fl/ clusters do worse in the medial condition relative to the initial
(stressed) condition is evidence of them being less attractive as heterosyllabic
clusters when compared to s-stops. This is explained by SYLLABLE-CONTACT.
9.5 Conclusion
This last experiment contributed evidence in favor of the activity of positional
faithfulness, not just in consonant selection (results of Experiments 1-3), but also
in order of acquisition of clusters. The fact that clusters were produced on the
whole most faithfully in word-initial stressed position compared to word-initial
unstressed and medial stressed positions, is attributable to the prominence of
both initial and stressed syllables, formalized as the constraints, MAX-σ[HEAD] and
MAX-σ[INITIAL]. Secondarily, the interaction found between cluster type and position
suggested again a role of sonority, in light of a hint of a preference given to the
221
heterosyllabification of s-nasal and s-stop clusters compared to stop- and
fricative-liquid clusters.

CHAPTER 10
CONCLUSION
10.1 Introduction
In this chapter, I summarize how the experimental findings presented in
chapters 5-9 can be brought to bear on hypotheses regarding activity of certain
classes of constraints in phonological development. I will discuss how specific
segmental, positional, and prosodic asymmetries arise from these constraints.
The first set of findings relates to what I've referred to as order of acquisition,
that is, the relative markedness of one cluster with respect to another. The
second set pertains to asymmetrical repairs, i.e., how the choice to preserve one
consonant over another in cases of cluster reduction can depend crucially on
factors such as position, prosody and segment type. I will conclude with a
discussion of residual issues as possible directions for future research.
10.2 Order of acquisition
Although the research conducted in this dissertation is not longitudinal, I have
used the term order of acquisition to refer to the relative markedness of clusters
of different types and/or in different positions. This is under the assumption that
structures of lesser markedness will be acquired earlier than those of greater
markedness, particularly in the case in which structures under comparison differ
minimally in their satisfaction vs. violation of a specific markedness or
223
faithfulness constraint. These assumptions follow from particular principles of
phonological learning: the idea that markedness constraints begin higher ranked
than faithfulness constraints and that the demotion of such constraints (based on
positive evidence) occurs gradually.
The table below contains a summary of findings from Experiments 1-5
that are relevant to asymmetries in order of acquisition, that is differences among
rates of faithful production that depend on categories such as sonority, syllable
weight, etc. Squares are shaded when a constraint was not tested for in a
particular experiment. Italics within the cells are used to indicate situations in
which a predicted effect was NOT found. A “ > “ symbol is used to indicate a
preference for one cluster over another, quantified as percentage of faithful
production.

10.2.1 Initial - medial asymmetries (syllable structure vs. positional faith)
The existence of syllable structure constraints regulating the presence of codas
and complex onsets makes positional asymmetries in consonant cluster
production possible. Results of Experiments 1 and 4 showed significantly better
performance on medial clusters than on initial clusters. In both of these
experiments the medial clusters held responsible for such an effect were likely to
225
be heterosyllabic. Below I show how different permutations of basic syllable
constraints with FAITH render possible the effect described above.

Of the 5 different permutations of these constraints, only one results in
asymmetry (defined as the production of a cluster in one position, but not in
another). In this grammar, a cluster occurs intervocalically, but not word-
initially. The existence of such an intermediate stage is suggested by results from
Experiments 1 and 4.
The opposite asymmetry does not emerge from any ranking of the above
constraints. However, once we broaden our set of constraints to include
positional faithfulness constraints, we can obtain the opposite asymmetry. This
is shown below:
227
(6) Grammar 5: √ initial x medial
NOCODA, MAX-σ[INITIAL] >> *COMPLEX >> MAX
/CCV/ NOCODA MAX-σ[INITIAL] *COMPLEX MAX

Lb. [CCV] *
/VCCV/ NOCODA MAX-σ[INITIAL] *COMPLEX MAX
Lc. [V.CV] *
d. [V.CCV] *!
e. [VC.CV] *!
In this grammar, the ranking of NOCODA and *COMPLEX over MAX results in
cluster reduction, unless the cluster occurs in initial position. In this
environment, the higher ranking of the positional faithfulness constraint (MAX-
σ[INITIAL]) above the markedness constraint (*COMPLEX), allows clusters to surface in
this position only. Experiment 5 found evidence for precisely such a constraint:
clusters in initial syllables were produced faithfully a greater percentage of the
time than those in medial syllables when stress was held constant.
The difference between the asymmetry found in Experiments 1 and 4
(medial > initial) and that identified in Experiment 5 (initial > medial) is that in
the former experiments, the medial clusters followed a stressed syllable and
preceded an unstressed syllable, while in the latter experiment, the medial
clusters followed an unstressed syllable and preceded a stressed syllable. In the
latter context it is more likely for a medial /CC/ sequence to be syllabified as a
complex onset. The initial-medial asymmetry noted for experiments 1 and 4, in
which medial clusters were produced significantly more faithfully than initial
228
clusters was most likely in large part a consequence of clusters (in particular, of
the /sC/ sort) being heterosyllabic word medially following a stressed vowel.
10.2.2 Prosodic asymmetries (STRESS-TO-WEIGHT / MAX-σ
σ
σ
σ[HEAD])
Experiments 1, 2 and 3 all tested the effect of stress and vowel quality on
the tendency to preserve both members of an intervocalic consonant cluster.
Hypotheses rested principally on the constraint STRESS-TO-WEIGHT, which
requires stressed syllables to be heavy. The general idea was that another
markedness constraint, instead of a faithfulness constraint, could put pressure on
the cluster to appear in some contexts, but not in others. Specifically, a cluster
was expected most often following a stressed syllable containing a lax vowel. In
this case, assuming vowel lengthening to not always be available as a repair, the
association of C1 to the preceding syllable would satisfy STRESS-TO-WEIGHT.
When the preceding syllable was unstressed or stressed with a tense vowel,
STRESS-TO-WEIGHT was already satisfied; having a coda consonant would be
extraneous.
In fact, results from all three experiments showed a quite significant effect
of prosody, with /CC/ produced intervocalically most often following a stressed
lax vowel than following either a stressed tense vowel or an unstressed vowel.
In most cases, there was a further split between post-tense and post-unstressed
conditions, although these differences were not always significant in magnitude.
229
The further separation between post-tense and post-unstressed conditions could
be explainable by another constraint, WEIGHT-TO-STRESS, which is violated by a
heavy unstressed syllable.
10.2.3 Sonority-driven segmental asymmetries and interaction between cluster
type and position
Sonority was predicted to have an effect on the comparative performance among
clusters of different types both word initially and word medially. Word initially,
SONORITY SEQUENCING and MINIMAL DISTANCE constraints predict that an onset
consisting of two consonants that are farther away from one another on the
sonority scale (with C1 lower on the scale than C2) should be acquired before a
cluster in which C1 and C2 are closer on the sonority scale, or in which C2 is of
lesser sonority with respect to C1. In experiment 1 stop-liquid clusters were more
faithfully produced than s-stop clusters in initial position, which I took as
evidence for the SSP. In Experiment 4, pairwise comparisons among various
word-initial /sC/ clusters revealed no substantial differences in the tendency to
be reduced or faithfully realized in word-initial position, although a trend was
present by which /sw/ clusters were preferred over /sm/ and /sp/ clusters.
Finally, Experiment 5 found stop-liquid clusters to be produced on the whole
more faithfully than all other clusters, but there were not significant differences
in this experiment between stop-liquid production and s-stop production (across
both initial conditions) as there were for Experiment 1. I have no explanation for
230
the fact that a difference evident in initial stressed position in Experiment 5 (stop-
liquid > s-stop, among other clusters) is lost completely in the initial unstressed
condition.
Word medially, the predictions made by SYLLABLE CONTACT are that 2-
member clusters in which the sonority value of C1 exceeds that of C2 will be
preferred to those in which the relative sonority of C2 exceeds that of C1. The
effects of this constraint were tested in Experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4. In experiment
1, there was a significant interaction between position (post-lax, post-tense,
initial) and cluster type (stop-liquid, s-stop), with stop-liquid clusters produced
faithfully at a much greater rate than s-stop clusters in initial position, while no
difference between the two clusters was found in medial position.
Intervocalically, the fact that there was no longer a preference for stop-liquid
clusters is evidence that the s-stop cluster is allowed to be divided into 2 different
syllables. If that same option had been as available for stop-liquid clusters as for
s-stop clusters, then we would have expected an overall preference for stop-
liquid clusters in medial position as well. The fact that there is no longer a bias
towards stop-liquid clusters in medial position led me to the conclusion that s-
stops are better heterosyllabic clusters than stop-liquids. This is precisely the
prediction of SYLLABLE CONTACT. In Experiment 4, evidence for SYLLABLE
CONTACT came from the better overall performance on /zb/ clusters than on /zw/
231
clusters, while the direction of the trend was the reverse in initial position. In
addition, there was a greater tendency for C2 of the cluster to become less
sonorous (e.g. m → b) than to become more sonorous (e.g. b → m; m → w) in the
cases in which the identity of C2 underwent a change in the child’s mapping.
Finally, in Experiment 5, the interaction between position and cluster type,
whereby s-stop and s-nasal clusters surpass other clusters in faithful production
in the medial condition only is additional evidence for SYLLABLE CONTACT in
acquisition.
10.3 Reduction
This section recapitulates experimental findings pertaining to consonant
selection in the face of cluster reduction. The chart in (4) lists results for each
experiment and notes whether each finding can be viewed as potential support
for one or the other (or both) of the faithfulness vs. markedness hypotheses
compared throughout this thesis.

constraints against velar onsets
82 This also implies a role for markedness, perhaps in the form of STRESS-TO-WEIGHT, but operating
on a different level of representation (not output).
233
On the basis of the reduction results for Experiments 1, 2 and 3, I have concluded
that there is a definite need for prosodic faithfulness to explain patterns of
consonant selection in medial position. However, there seem to be fairly
compelling reasons for believing that markedness plays a role as well.
I found the strongest determining factor in intermediate consonant
selection to be that of order (C1 vs. C2) when the cluster preceded a stressed
syllable (and followed an unstressed syllable). I have suggested that this result
requires a need for a faithfulness constraint that is relativized to stressed
syllables, and probably, in addition, to onsets of stressed syllables. For when the
cluster follows a stressed syllable (and precedes an unstressed syllable), the
results are less uniform. In fact, Experiment 2 reveals an effect of order (C1 vs.
C2) in the post-stressed syllable context as well; however, no such effect is
present in this context in Experiment 3. Because of the lack of agreement
between these two sets of experimental results, further investigation is needed in
order to determine if the ordering asymmetry is pertinent to both prosodic
conditions and not just when the cluster precedes a stressed syllable. Improving
our understanding of these influences will no doubt aid in ascertaining more
precisely the right definition to give to this prosodic faithfulness constraint.
Another way in which results from Experiments 2 and 3 differ is in the
relative difference between fricative (vs. stop) selection in the post-tense and
234
post-lax conditions. There was an overall difference found in Experiment 2, with
fricative selection more frequent in the post-lax context than in the post-tense
context. This effect was not significant in Experiment 3, although there was a
definite trend in that same direction (for both orders: fricative-stop and stop-
fricative). These results suggest the influence of both STRESS-TO-WEIGHT and
sonority constraints that prefer less sonorous onsets and/or more sonorous codas.
The fact that the nasal consonant was never selected over the stop in the
post-stressed (post-lax/post-tense) contexts seems inconsistent with the effect
discussed in the above paragraph, since nasals are even more distant in sonority
from stops than from fricatives. However, assuming the intervocalic consonant
to be ambisyllabic, rather than a coda alone, this could be the result of a nasal
being too marked an onset. It is also possible that the nasal feature is sometimes
transferred to the preceding vowel, in this case allowing for the preservation of
the second consonant in the cluster. However, if this is an explanation for the
cases in which stress precedes the cluster, it does not hold in the cases in which
stress follows the cluster. When the nasal occurs as C2 preceding a stressed
syllable, the nasal is retained over the stop approximately 70% of the time. In the
data collected for this experiment, nasalized vowels were transcribed only
sporadically. Subjecting such productions to acoustic analysis would assist in
assessing the viability of such a hypothesis.
235
10.4 Residual issues
I conclude the thesis with a discussion of additional issues raised but not dealt
with directly by the current research, and that, therefore, constitute potential
avenues for new research and/or extensions of the current experiments. They
include inter-child variation and the application of these results to a particular
learning algorithm, along with the role of lexical frequency in driving results,
further exploration of the role of positional faithfulness in acquisition and the
appropriate formalizations of such theoretical constructs.
10.4.1 Inter-child variation and stages of development
Because of the nature of the experimental design (the fact that I evaluate data
pooled across children, rather than analyzing data by individual subject), I
would not have been able to conduct a typological survey. An examination of
individual patterns (e.g. Jongstra, 2003) could lead to claims regarding which
stages are attested and which are not, and whether all of the attested stages are
consistent with the predictions at hand. Furthermore, a longitudinal design
would permit the construction of actual learning paths, that is, characterizations
of how children's phonological grammars change over time. Furthermore, inter-
child variation could be studied more systematically.
The disadvantage of a methodology designed to look at individual data is
that it often does not lend itself to statistical evaluation. It is difficult to ascertain
236
whether between-child variation is a result of random variation as opposed to
meaningful differences. A large amount of data collected for each child would
be necessary in order to overcome this problem.
10.4.2 Learning theory
Although I've followed several standard assumptions concerning how the
process of phonological acquisition takes place, I have yet to evaluate in any
detail whether the data can be adequately accommodated by a learning
algorithm (e.g. Boersma, 1997; Tesar & Smolensky, 2000, etc.) and if so, which
one.
The gradual learning algorithm (GLA) (e.g. Boersma, 1997; Boersma &
Levelt, 2000) is attractive because it allows not only for the existence of distinct
stages of "intermediate" development, but also for substantial within-child
variation. Such variation is represented by stages in which the child is expected
to be noncategorical: alternating between different forms based on non-strict
rankings between constraints. This seems an accurate reflection of how learning
takes place based on the longitudinal data I've looked at (e.g. Compton &
Streeter, 1977). At the same time, because constraint demotion (and promotion)
is driven by lexical frequency, the model predicts relatively little variation among
children. Specifically, it predicts that variation in learning paths will occur when
two structures are very close in lexical frequency in the adult language (e.g.
237
Boersma & Levelt, 2000). Since I don't approach the question of inter-child
variation in these experiments, I leave this issue to future investigation.
Relevant again to the frequency-driven nature of the algorithm, an aspect
of my experimental results that would be problematic for the GLA in its current
form is the role played by positional faithfulness constraints, such as MAX-σ[HEAD]
and MAX-σ[INITIAL]. As specific faithfulness constraints, these are violated by the
adult outputs much less often than their general MAX counterparts. Since
movement of constraints (up or down) is proportionally related to frequency, we
would predict general FAITH to precede specific FAITH in rising up in the
constraint hierarchy. This clearly makes it difficult to construct an intermediate
stage in which positional faithfulness is active. An additional mechanism is
needed.83
For quite current research into this aspect of learning theory, see
Tessier (2006).
10.4.3 Prosodic faithfulness, prosodified inputs, and perception grammars
Results pertaining to both consonant selection preferences and prominence-
based order of acquisition results have demonstrated the role of prosodic
faithfulness constraints in phonological acquisition. The way in which this
faithfulness has been formalized here (as HEAD-MAX) forces the assumption that
83 Ideas include an initial ranking in which specific faithfulness constraints start out higher than
general faithfulness constraints or a bias in the process of reranking by which the child promotes
the most specific faithfulness constraint possible rather than both faithfulness constraints (general
+ specific) which are violated in the mapping between the adult output and his/her input.
238
inputs are endowed with prosodic structure, in part, for greater expository
simplicity. Precisely such an assumption has been argued against within
phonological theory on the basis of non-contrastive information being held to be
absent from underlying representations coupled with the observation that no
language possesses a syllabification contrast (McCarthy, 2003). However, it is
also true that the presence of syllable structure in the child’s input in the course
of acquisition is consistent with the claim that the input to the child’s production
grammar matches the adult output. For this reason, I maintain that prosodic
structure can persist at some level, even if it does not get stored in the child’s
lexical representation. If it is not, in fact, part of the lexical representation, we
can imagine that the faithfulness constraints discussed here regulate the
mapping between the adult surface representation and the child surface
representation in addition to the mapping between the child’s lexical
representation and the child output representation. While these are essentially
faithfulness constraints between two outputs (adult output and child output),
they are quite different from the output-output faithfulness constraints that hold
over morphologically related forms (e.g. Benua, 1997). The diagram below
illustrates the different levels of representation and mappings that are indicative
of different areas of phonological learning, as posited by Pater (2004). While
239
markedness constraints remain the same in all mappings, domain-specific
faithfulness constraints hold between distinct levels of representation.
(7) Acoustic Representation (Pater, 2004; p. 233)
FAITH (AS)
Surface Representation (adult)
FAITH (SL)
Lexical Representation
FAITH (LS)
Surface Representation (child)
The proposed modification of the model in (7) allows simply for further
interaction between the different strata, as indicated in (8). For simplification’s
sake, the first level (Acoustic representation) has been eliminated.
(8) Surface Representation (adult)
Lexical Representation Surface Representation (child)
By positing mappings not only between the child lexical representation and
surface representation but also between the adult surface representation and the
child surface representation, we can avoid the problem of syllable structure
being part of the child’s lexical representation. Furthermore, under this model,
the syllable structure that is present in the child’s perception of the adult surface
240
representation (referred to as Surface Representation (adult)) is a product of the
constraint ranking which maps the acoustic form to the surface representation
(see 7). A tableau illustrating how the child arrives at a certain input
syllabification based upon the mapping between acoustic representation (AR)
and (adult) surface representation (SR) is given in (9).
(9) FAITH (AS) >> SYLL-CON >> NOCODA >> *COMPLEX
/VspV/ FAITH (AS) SYLL-CON *COMPLEX NOCODA
La. /Vs.pV/ *
b. /V.spV/ *!
c. /V.pV/ *!
/VblV/ FAITH (AS) SYLL-CON *COMPLEX NOCODA
Ld. /V.blV/ *
e. /Vb.lV/ *! *
f. /V.bV/ *!
Because FAITH (AS) outranks *COMPLEX and NOCODA, the child’s perception of the
presence of onset clusters and codas is accurate at this stage, meaning that no
deletion occurs on the perceptual level. It is the ranking between the various
markedness constraints that determines what the syllabification is taken to be by
the child. In the case illustrated above, there is an asymmetry between s-stop
and stop-liquid clusters, with the former taken to be heterosyllabic and the latter
tautosyllabic. This pattern parallels the one often cited in psycholinguistic
literature in which syllabification tasks are submitted to adults (e.g. Treiman &
241
Zukowski, 1990).84
Hence the chosen outputs (9a and 9d, in this case) will be
used as input to the grammars that map to lexical representations and the child’s
own outputs. Because faithfulness constraints are relativized to specific
grammatical domains, we can capture the divide between perception and
production. The child at this stage may not be producing onset clusters, even
though (s)he can perceive them.
There is clearly more to be said about the nature of the child's inputs, in
addition to the development of their perception grammars. This experiment has
focused exclusively on the area of production. A question for further research is
whether some of the same developmental asymmetries discussed in this thesis
can be found in speech perception development as well. The multi-layer model
of grammatical development proposed in Pater (2004) and reviewed here would
predict they can.
10.4.4 Other extensions
The acquisition of certain aspects of syllable structure, such as codas and
complex onsets, has been tested experimentally in the area of second language
phonology as well as first (see, for example, Broselow & Finer, 1996; Broselow et
al, 1998). Such an application represents an obvious extension of the current
research both with regard to order of acquisition and repairs. While adults have
84 A reversal in the ranking between *COMPLEX and NOCODA will result simply in symmetry, with
both clusters held to be tautosyllabic.
242
traditionally been shown to repair clusters through epenthesis rather than
deletion, it is possible that position of the cluster and prosodic context can affect,
for example, the extent to which epenthesis is, in fact, chosen over deletion or
substitution, in addition to the site of epenthesis, when it occurs.
Ohala (1996) reported some interesting experimental results in the case of
clusters that are non-native to English (for example, /tf/ clusters). She found that
sonority of the consonants played little role in determining which consonant was
retained in the child productions. The trend was simply to preserve C2 of the
word initial cluster. She hypothesized that this was due to insertion on the
perceptual level and unstressed initial syllable deletion in production. The
testing of non-native clusters in different word positions and prosodic contexts
represents another interesting avenue of research. Finally, in terms of positional
asymmetries, a logical extension involves the inclusion of word-final position in
both areas of inquiry (reduction and order of acquisition).
