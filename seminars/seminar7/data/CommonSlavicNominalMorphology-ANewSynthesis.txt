2.1.8. The Development of Long Low Vowels After /j/ 13
2.1.7. Accentuation and Notation
This has long been recognised as a very problematic area in Slavic, whether
one is working with the modem, attested languages, or reconstructions, and
therefore the approach to be adopted in this monograph may at first seem
like an attempt to simply avoid what is a very complicated issue.
Nevertheless, there are still some larger questions which have never been
properly faced by scholars who attempt to link SI accentuation as a whole
with the oft-proposed developments in final syllables (see 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4
below). Furthermore, many scholars have contented themselves with scat­
tered comments in passing, cf. Hujer 1920: 54. However, I follow Stang
1957: 14: “_it cannot be stated that Slavonic shows any after-effects of the
old intonation difference in final syllables”; Ebeling 1967: 581:
“Phonetically, there are no ... examples in the oldest history of Slavic where
the place of the stress would be responsible for a different development of a
vowel”; see also Kortlandt 1983, which includes several such statements,
culminating in 1983:- 179: “There is no evidence for timbre differences
which are due to stress or tone in early Slavic”. It should also be noted that
although Kortlandt 1994: 91 subsequently insists that “... much of the ear­
lier literature has become obsolete to the extent that it is based upon an in­
terpretation which does not take the multifarious accentual developments
into account”, it is somewhat disappointing not to find him actually citing
any examples where accentuation would have had a tangible effects on the
development of vowel quality in Common Slavic, apart from the contested
Hirt theory (see 4.1.2 below), which is, in any case, restricted to final sylla­
bles. Accentuation will not therefore be provided for SI examples unless
specifically required by the discussion.1

2.1.8. The Development of Long Low Vowels After /j/
This is a much-discussed issue, although many scholars have avoided it: did
Common Slavic *-ja- develop to *-je- (*-je-) and then to *-ja-l Or did it
remain as *-ja-, and not undergo any fronting at all?
The evidence is equivocal. It is closely bound up with the development
ofja t’ (e, i), one of the more complicated parts of the phonological history
1
5 Several scholars have drawn attention to this tendency, e.g., Berneker 1904: 372-
73; Schmalstieg 1986b: 380 injects a welcome cautionary note into the debate: “...
it seems ... that a system with phonologically unconditioned position of stress
contours in unstressed syllables would be close to a perceptual overload in the
grammar for the hearer.”
14 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
of Common Slavic. We may start off by noting that in Glagolitic ja and e
are denoted by the same symbol: A; see Ferrell 1971: 90-92 for discussion,
and some minor modifications. This would suggest that the two seg-
ments/clusters were phonetically very close.1

It would undoubtedly be simpler to assume that Ijl did NOT cause the
fronting of long low vowels, i.e., /a/; fronting would have affected only *d
(*d), *m, and *u, e.g.,
‘-ju- > *-fi-, e.g., *flgo < *jugo
ju- > *-j'F-, e.g., *siti < *sjuti
‘-ja-(*-jo) > *-je-, e.g., *polje < *poljo
(*palje < *palja)
BUT
‘yoke’
‘sew’
‘field’
*-ja-(*-jo-) > *-ja-, e.g., *z,emlja < *z,emja ‘land’1
The vowel *a is normally assumed to have been [-tense], whereas the
vowel *a is assumed to have been [+tense]. Tense vowels would be less
prone to fronting in this instance.
CS1 *e < IE *e becomes *a after c, s, z, and j, e.g.,
*kedu
*beg+e+ti
*sliix+e+ti
*stoj+e+ti
> *cedu
> *bez.eti
> *slyseti
> *stojeti
> *cadu ‘smoke’
> *be£ati ‘flee’
> *slysati ‘hear’
> *stojati ‘stand’
Samilov 1964: 115-26 cites several forms, from all over Slavic, that seem to
suggest that there was some degree of variation between *e and *ja, which
might in turn point to *ja having undergone fronting at some stage. One
striking example is the interplay between the two originally distinct suffixes
*-janinu. and *-eninti, see also Shevelov 1964: 259. Meillet 1965: 119 sug­
gests that the change may have taken place and then been reversed: “... *ja
1
6The phonemic status of Ijl in the modem SI languages would seem to be indis­
putable. However, factors such as Glagolitic A led some scholars, e.g., Trubetskoy
1968: 62, followed by Kortlandt 1979: 259, to suggest that Ijl did not in fact have
the status of a phoneme in Old Church Slavonic, and only developed as such at a
later date, although the majority view, e.g., Lunt 1981: 42, 53-56, 65, 1987: 274-
75, fn. 70, 71, is that it did. This is treated in some detail by Collins 1992, and sup­
ported by Nuorluoto 1994: 17 fn.
1
7A variant is proposed by Milewski 1931: 81; 1932: 11, who suggests that initial
*ja- > *je-, e.g., OCSjexati ‘go’, but *jd-* > *ja-, e.g., OCS jaru ‘strong’.
2.2. The Question of Auslautgesetze 15
a de meme passe a *je ... *je a lui-meme passe a ja.” Such a stage would
probably have been very transitory. The syllable *-ja is extremely common
in CS1 declensional endings, and also in initial and medial position, e.g.,
OCS zemlja, dajati,jaru (< *-ja). As we shall see below (2.4.5, 5.2.2), the
influence of Ijl can shed some light on the question of the status of long
nasal diphthongs in Common Slavic.
Velceva 1988: 39 suggests that forms such as *zemli (< *zetnje:j <
*zetnja:j, in Velceva’s notation) show that *a must have been fronted after
Ijl. However, they could just as easily be the result of a general shortening of
long diphthongs, in which case *zemli would be from *zemjej (< *zemjaj),
see 3.fn. 40 for further discussion.
However, the stage where only *a, and not *e, was possible after c, s, z,
j may have been transitory in the history of Common Slavic. The emergence
of e3 in North Slavic as Common Slavic was splitting apart led to a situa­
tion, in North Slavic at least, where a contrast between *a and *e was again
possible after c, s, z, j\ this may also have been a factor in the spread of e3.
See also 4.5, 4.6, 5.3.7, 6.2.
2.1.9. Periodisation
Certain scholars set great store by attempts at a detailed periodisation of the
reconstructed history of Common Slavic right back to IE (cf. especially
Kortlandt 1979). In this monograph the following approximate chronologi­
cal stages will be reconstructed: PIE (Proto-Indo-European); NIE (North
Indo-European (Germanic, Baltic, and Slavic), Balto-Slavic, and Common
Slavic. These reconstructed stages are simply meant to serve as part of a
general framework for viewing the proposed developments.
Indo-European and Slavic will be used as essentially timeless, general
designations for Indo-European and Slavic respectively. EIE (European
Indo-European) designates IE languages spoken in Europe, or languages
whose speakers left Europe in recent historical times (cf. English, Afrikaans,
French, Spanish, Russian, etc.).
2.2. The Question of Auslautgesetze
Since the earliest discussions of the topic, ALG have been reconstructed for
the history of Common Slavic, more so than in other IE languages (see also
2.1.2, 2.1.4 above).18 The original motivation for doing so seems to have
1
8 Cf. Pedersen 1905: 321: “Indessen sind die slavischen auslautgesetze bedeutend
durchsichtiger als etwa die germanischen.”
16 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
been an attempt to fit the actually attested SI evidence to the type of IE that
we would probably reconstruct by relying solely on Sanskrit, Greek and
Latin, cf. the repeated attempts by scholars to find a phonological and/or
phonetic development that would allow the SI *o-stem dat sg ending -u to
be traced back to IE *-di, reconstructed on the basis of perceived evidence
from Greek and Lithuanian; the *o-stem instr pi ending -y to be traced back
to IE *-dis, on the basis of Sanskrit; or the *a-stem gen sg ending -y to be
traced back to IE *-as.'9
All too often, albeit less so nowadays than previously, these equations
are simply quoted in comparative grammars, whether of IE or Slavic,
without any attempt at tracing the development, and one is therefore left
with such typologically unlikely phonetic developments (in one jump) as *-
oi > *-u or *-dis > *-w (> *-y), as in e.g., the oft-proposed vluku ‘w olf dat
sg < *vlkdi, cf. Gk Luxcp (< *-di, also Lith vilkui < *-di id); vliXky < *vlkdis
‘wolves’ instr pi, cf. Skt vrkaih < id, which are rendered all the more
improbable by the fact that they occur nowhere else in the language.1

It should be noted, however, that at first sight similar typologically un­
likely sound changes actually do seem to be attested elsewhere, although
none of these are the result of a single-stage sound-change; they are rather
the cumulative result of several changes, separated from each other by cen­
19 Van Wijk 1925: 284-86 cites possible parallels in other IE languages; in dis­
cussing the Slavic forms he says, somewhat surprisingly (286) “... bis in die
Einzelheiten sind diese Probleme wohl kaum zu losen; das braucht uns aber nicht
daran zu hindem, slav. -u und -y aus idg. -oi bezw. -dis herzuleiten.”
A very welcome note in this regard comes from Lockwood 1969: 137, an
introductory IE textbook with a heavy bias towards Gmc data (only ten pages on
Balto-Slavic, as opposed to twenty-six on Germanic); he lists many of the
problematic endings as “unexplained”, and warns the reader: “It should not be
forgotten, however, that the Indo-European endings postulated on the basis of a
comparison with Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit may not be entirely valid for that part of
Indo-European from which Old Church Slavonic descends ... Doubtless further
alternative reconstructions should be posited in view of the dialect differences
within Primitive Indo-European.”

cussion see Kuznecov 1961b: 75-78. For Baltic, Maziulis loc. cit. would deny the
validity of *vlkdi > vilkui as a direct development.

turies, and fitting into patterns well-attested elsewhere in the respective lan­
guages, e.g.,
*au > *ei (> *i)
Cz lid (< *u (/C ’_)
Eng leaf (< OE leaf)
Far seydur
*oi > *u
Lat unus ‘one’(< *oin-) cf. Old Lat oinos, oenos, Ir aon, Gk olvog, Go
ains < IE *oin-
*oi > *d
Eng home (OE ham, cf. Ger Heim ‘home’< CGmc *haim- < IE
*koim-, cf. Lith seima, OCS semija ‘family’)
Therefore, it might be stated that *au > i in the history of Czech and both
*au> Tand *oi > d in the development of English, though any historical lin­
guist would immediately recognise such a statement as a gross oversimplifi­
cation.
Some scholars attempt to support *-oi > *-u by citing typological paral­
lels and splitting the sound changes into stages, e.g., Pedersen 1905: 324-25
cites the Lat developments, and additional data from Danish and Armenian;
Milewski 1932: 11-12 cites data from Latin, Umbrian, Greek, and
Brythonic, see also Vaillant 1950: 122, 213. There is no evidence of such
stages anywhere else in Slavic, however, and no attempt is made on such
occasions to even suggest them.
There are some ALG reconstructed for Common Slavic which are al­
most universally accepted without question. As we have seen, these are
normally given as *-dm > *-u and *-ons > *-y. Another one, *-os > *-u, has
been the subject of much discussion, and for the purposes of this monograph
its rejection will be a given. It has been disputed by many scholars in the
field, e.g., Jagic 1906: 118; Mikkola 1950: 29; Hujer 1910: 12-36, 1920:
26-30 (but see 1920: 98); Leskien 1876: 3-5, 65, 1907; Mares 1962: 20;
Shevelov 1964: 156-57; Liidtke 1966: 133; Kiparsky 1967: 25-26;
Georgiev 1969: 53; Stieber 1969: 12, 22; Aitzetmiiller 1978: 76; Feinberg
1978: 109; Kortlandt 1983: 182; Lamprecht 1987: 81, and many others.
Most recently, Vermeer 1991: 275-85 has provided us with a brief history
of the issue of *-os > *-u, stating, however, that “A comprehensive treat­
ment of existing solutions to the problems of the reflexes of Proto-Indo-
European *-os and *-dm in Slavic would require a book (1991: 273 fn. 4)”,

< *au, cf. OIc saudr ‘sheep’
18 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
and he questions why *-os > *-u has continued even to be discussed as a
viable reconstruction (see also 4.fn. 4).
Unlike the proposals cited above (*-di > -u or *-dis > *-u (> *-y)), how­
ever, *-om > *-u and *-ons > *-y can actually be made to explain a large
number of problematic endings in the reconstruction of earlier, preliterate
stages of Slavic than those actually attested in documentation, and to link
those reconstructed SI endings to forms attested elsewhere in IE. These
problematic endings can be found in several grammatical categories; they
can be found in declension (both nominal and pronominal), e.g., OCS masc
*o-stem ace sg vluku < *ulkom ‘wolf’; (j)azu < *e(g)(h)6m T ; conjugation,
e.g., OCS 1st sg aorist idu < *fiddm ‘I went’, and invariant forms such as
prepositions, e.g., OCS ku ‘towards’< *kdm. The exact applicability of *-dm
> *-u and *-ons > *-y has never been fixed: some scholars use them to ex­
plain forms in ways disputed by others, although none of the sides in such a
dispute would question whether the sound-changes actually occurred.2
1
Liidtke 1966: 117 points out that there seem to be TWO sorts of ALG
reconstructed for IE languages: QUANTITATIVE and QUALITATIVE. He
further pointed out that in Germanic and Baltic (he might have added Celtic)
ALG invariably include QUANTITATIVE changes, e.g.,
CGmc *dagd(m) > Ole daga ‘days’ gen pi (reduction of *-d and loss
of *-m in final position);
CGmc *stainam > Runic Gmc staina ‘stone’ acc sg (loss of *-m in
final position);
CCel *uiros > OIrfer ‘man’ (loss of final short syllable);
Lat amat> Spanish ama ‘s/he loves’ (loss of final consonant);
IE *oktou > Go ahtau ‘eight’ (shortening of final long diphthong);22
CGmc *berd > OHG biru ‘I bear’ (shortening of final long vowel).
Slavic shows similar QUANTITATIVE sound changes throughout its history:
21 The exact applicability of *-dm > *-u and *-os > *-u has never been fixed;
Kozlovskij 1887: 657 compared the OCS forms tamu ‘there’, kamii ‘where’, amu
‘there’ to Gk Tfipog ‘then’, jrfjpog ‘when?’, ripog ‘when?’, thus apparently provid­
ing another example of *-os > *-u. Agrell 1926: 37 fn. 2, however, referred to other
Gk forms such as rapov, and suggested that there was some degree of variation be­
tween *-o and *-6m in IE.
22 Slightly simplifying the presentation in d’Alquen 1988: 220.
2.2. The Question of Auslautgesetze 19
CS1 *ulkod > OCS vluka ‘wolf’ gen sg (loss of final dental stop);
CS1 *rankam > *rgkg > Pol rqkq_ ‘hand’ acc sg (shortening of the
original final long nasal vowel);
CS1 *gVlva > Cz hlava ‘head’ (shortening of the final long vowel);
OR e-bJiKb > R eojiK ‘wolf’ acc sg (loss of the final jer; see also
Arumaa 1964: 110, passim)
In most reconstructions, however, exclusively QUALITATIVE ALG are pro­
posed for Slavic. Such sound-changes are never proposed for word-initial or
word-internal syllables. Five such ALG are commonly proposed for Slavic.
The first three mentioned below were discussed in 2.1.4, e.g.,
IE *ulqom > OCS vluku ‘w olf acc sg (the *<5 is raised to *u and then
the final nasal is dropped).
IE *ulqons > OCS vluky ‘wolves’ acc pi (however one reconstructs
the exact sequence here, raising the *o to *u is one of the common
threads running'through all the reconstructions).
IE *ulqos > OCS vluku ‘w olf (the *d is raised to *u and then the final
*-s is dropped).
IE *mate(r) > OCS mati ‘mother’ (the *-e reconstructed on the basis
of evidence from other IE languages is raised, without loss of length,
to *-/).
IE *akmd(n) > OCS kamy ‘stone’ (the *-5 reconstructed on the basis
of evidence from other IE languages is raised, without loss of length,
to *-u (> -y), see also 2.1.6, 4.9, and 5.5).23
At this stage it should be reiterated that the loss of final consonants in
Common Slavic is not an ALG as proposed here; it is part of the general
tendency within the history of Late Common Slavic known as the “Law of
the Open Syllable”, whereby the structure of every syllable was modelled
according the principle of RISING SONORITY: ((S)C(R)V).24
23 Duridanov 1968 proposed that the raising of *-o and *-e in final syllables might
be seen as the earliest specifically SI sound change, separate from Balto-Slavic
(quoted in Birnbaum 1975: 270). It also appears that a sound-change *-o > *-u in
final syllables can be reconstructed for Celtic, see Lewis and Pedersen 1961: 65-66.
24 For a summary of developments within the syllable see Nahtigal 1952: 41-47,
and Bemstejn 1963 for general discussion.
It should be mentioned here that, despite achieving much greater consistency
than several other such partially parallel tendencies, the Law of the Open Syllable in
Common Slavic still admitted some exceptions; some might view the prepositions
20 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
This tendency applied word-intemally as well as word-finally; see also
2.4.4 below.25
2.3. The Case for Auslautgesetze
2.3.1. Typology
As discussed in 2.2 above and 4 below, the reconstruction of ALG in
Common Slavic has a long tradition. Furthermore, from the typological
point of view, the CS1 ALG at first sight do not appear very unusual. Other
IE groups show apparently similar developments. Reductions and losses in
word-final position are widespread phenomenon in the development of IE
language groups. One apparently close parallel to the developments postu­
lated for Slavic can actually be seen in the history of Latin: the masc and
neut nom and acc endings attested in Classical Latin as -us, -um developed
from an older -os, -om, cf.
Old Latfilios > Latfilius ‘son’; Old Lat hortom > Lat hortum ‘garden’
acc sg
Brief lists of forms used as evidence for ALG are given below.
OCS bez ‘without’, iz ‘from’, etc. as such. More serious exceptions include adverbs
of time in *-gd- (Shevelov 1964: 191), and the development of twrf-groups over
much of the North Slavic area (Shevelov 1964: 466-87).
BemStejn 1963: 60-64; Arumaa 1976: 53 cite some evidence to show that these
tendencies continued into the history of the individual SI languages. Schmalstieg
1983b: xii, however, points out that: “... even if it [the Law of Open Syllables—
RAO] does include too many phenomena, it is nevertheless a handy mnemonic
device for such diverse events as the Slavic monophthongisations, the metatheses,
and the loss of final consonants.”
25 Several other ALG have been proposed within the history of the study of
Common Slavic; these, however, have not met with nearly as much acceptance as
those listed here, e.g., Zubaty and Hujer’s *-jas > *-e, criticised by Diels 1914: 321.

This is a formidable list, and at first glance the accumulated weight of the
evidence of these forms would seem to lend strong support for the recon­
struction of sound-changes *-dm > *-u and *-dns > *-y. Further support
might seem to be lent by the apparent existence of similar sound-changes
apparently reconstructible for vowels in other word-final syllables in
Common Slavic, and by apparent typological similarities to developments
usually reconstructed for other IE languages. The reasons for accepting
ALG may be summarised as follows:
1) The CS1 ALG appear to explain a great many forms,
2) The CS1 ALG have parallels over much of IE,
3) The CS1 ALG appear to have numerous typological parallels in other
languages.
27 This is a sandhi variant of vrkati, normally cited as such in handbooks.

2.4.1. Problems of Selection 23
2.4. The Case against Auslautgesetze
2.4.1. Problems of Selection
In this chapter, however, it will be argued that the traditional theory of CS1
ALG is inadequate for the following reasons:
1) There are certain forms that it cannot explain (2.4.2).
2) It does not include the concept of quantitative vs. qualitative ALG
(2.2).
3) It has given rise to several inconsistencies ( 2.4.4, 2.4.6, 2.4.7).
4) It does not fit in well with the rest of the CS1 phonological system,
and its development, in the following areas:
a) chronology (2.4.7);
b) typology (2.4.3, 2.4.4, 2.4.6).
Firstly, it should be noted that the forms given above have been carefully
selected to illustrate the apparently universal application of the traditional
CS1 ALG. It is in this context that we may recall that Bruckner 1910: 369
described the situation as “ein Rattenkonig von Widersprtichen”, and noted
that from the point of view of Greek, Old Church Slavonic has a different
ending for each of FIVE apparent Gk cognates in -ov (the Gk reflex of
*-dm)!:
OCS vedu
OCS vedg
OCS vedy
OCS jigo
OCS jaje
Gk ECpEQOV
Gk ECpEQOV
Gk cpEQOv
Gk ^uyov
Gk cpov
‘I bore’
‘they bore’
‘bearing’
‘yoke’
‘egg’
(1st sg aorist)
(3rd pi aorist)
(pres act part neut nom/acc sg)
(*<5-stem neut nom/acc sg)
(*yo-stem neut nom/acc sg)
Similar parallels could probably be cited for other IE languages; the point
here is that the CS1 ALG could easily be made to have much less
explanatory power simply by selecting different forms for purposes of
comparison than the ones cited above. In some cases the SI forms may not
even go back to IE *-dm. Furthermore, there is a small group of recalcitrant
forms which resist explanation by the traditional ALG:
24 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
2.4.2. Forms Not Explained by the Traditional Auslautgesetze
1) The 3rd pi aorist ending, e.g., mogg < *mogont ‘they were able’.
This ending is normally explained by pointing to the influence of a final
dental stop, which is said to have blocked the raising and denasalisation
postulated for *-dm and *-ons.
Parallel to the proposed development of *-ons, however, *mogont
should have developed thus: *mogont > *mogunt > *moguti > *mogy. This
would fit in nicely with the development in the neut nom sg pres act part
(see below).
It seems odd that the *-o in *-ons should have undergone raising, lead­
ing to the eventual loss of the nasal, while the *-o in *-ont should not.
Relative chronology complicates the position still further: during the gradual
development of the Law of the Open Syllable in Slavic, *-t# is generally
thought to have been lost prior to *-s#, and *-onts and *-ons should have
merged in *-ons, with subsequent development to *-y.
2) The Neuter Short Form Nominative Singular of the Present Active
Participle of Class I, II, and V verbs
From the point of view of the arguments presented here, the development of
this form is closely related to that of the 3rd pi aorist. In discussions of the sf
pres act part, it is nearly always the masc form which is cited and discussed
at some length, and one is left to glean the neut from tables.3
1 These forms
present problems in addition to the oft-discussed dialectal differences.
Firstly, the neut form of the sf pres act part would probably not have ended
in *-s, and therefore the motivation for reconstructing *-ons > *-y here
without comment is suspect; we might expect *-g < *-ont (cf. Gk cpegov <
*pheront, cited above). Secondly, why did the masc and neut forms merge,
when the tendency was to keep them apart (see below, and 3.2.3, 3.5.1,
5.3.1, 5.4, 6.2.5)?
Let us juxtapose the standard proposals32 for some oft-cited forms
containing a nasal sonant or *-t in a final syllable, as summarised in Table
2-4:
11 Ferrell 1971: 85 is one of the few scholars who does mention the neuter as a
problem.
32 As a rule, these forms are not cited together in this way; this format has been
adopted here to illustrate the proposals more clearly.

In its phonological development the neut nom sg pres act part sf should have
been identical to the aorist form quoted above, and therefore we would ex­
pect to see *-q (< *-ont) here as well if there had been a direct phonological
development, without any recourse to analogy.
It should be pointed out that the same threatened homonymy also seems
to have occurred in Baltic, but the manner in which it was resolved was dif­
ferent. At first sight it would appear that *-nt- cannot be reconstructed as a
verbal form for Baltic; the original 3rd sg ending is used for all 3rd person
functions in Lithuanian, Latvian, and Old Prussian from the earliest attesta­
tions, e.g., Lith veda ‘he/she/it/they lead(s)’, see Stang 1966: 409-16;
Endzellns 1971: 203-14, 253. Nevertheless, it does appear that the *-nt
ending can actually be reconstructed for Baltic with a verbal meaning, see
Stang 1966: 411; it appears as a nasal in Lithuanian, cf. vedq ‘chief, head’,
myl[ ‘love’ < *-nt. (see also 2.4.7, and 6.2, for further discussion).
3) The Masculine/Neuter Short Form Nominative Singular of the Present
Active Participle of Class IV Verbs
These forms have -<j in the masc/neut sf pres act part, and throughout the
declension, cf OCS molq ‘asking’ < *modlins. This form is usually ex­
plained as analogical: a generalisation of the nasal that appears in the obi
cases (and thus in non-final position), e.g., mol^/mol^sta, cf. Feinberg 1978:
118-19 fn. 11.1 suggest that in fact mol% is simply the REGULAR develop­
ment of *modlins.
26 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
4) The Reflexes of Tautosyllabic *-VN Combinations in Word-Internal
and Word-Initial Position.
The developments discussed above apply only to the final syllable of a
word. There are two special problems here.
a) The overwhelming majority of CS1 ALG involve the simple dropping
of a final nasal after a high vowel, i.e., *-iN> *-l\ *-uN (< *-dm, etc.)
> *-u, with the complete loss of any nasalisation. It is now, however,
generally accepted that *-in-/-un- also occurred in medial position in
Common Slavic. Despite much discussion in previous years, it is now
almost always proposed that these tautosyllabic *-VN- combinations
developed to nasal vowels like any other *-VN combinations, see
Shevelov 1964: 325-26, 1971a: 55-56, cited more fully in 2.4.3, see
also Entenman 1977: 62. Why should it have been any different in
word-final position?33
b) There are some *-VN# forms that do develop into nasal vowels in
Slavic, e.g., OCS nom/acc sg neut *men-stem vremq_ ‘time’ < *uert-
men (see also Ferrell 1965: 106).
It is eminently reasonable from the IE point of view to reconstruct this form
with a short vowel, more so than with the often-posited *-men (see, e.g.,
Ferrell 1965: 106-07; Kortlandt 1983: 176-77). Neut C-stems in IE do not
seem to have had a lengthened grade in the nom/acc sg (cf. Lat nomen -
nominis ‘name’), whereas masc C-stems do (later fern as well; cf. Lat sermo
- sermonis [masc] ‘talk’; hirundo - hirundinis [fern] ‘swallow’). This seems
to hold for Slavic as well. In, e.g., the neut *s-stem nom/acc sg slovo ‘word’,
the final -o can only go back to an IE short vowel. In vremq, therefore, we
have a clear example of a *-VN# combination developing to *Y # 34
33 The theory that IE syllabic *n developed into *
Yin Common Slavic has found a
small but steady stream of adherents, see Shevelov 1964: 90-91 for critical discus­
sion, more recently Jacobsson 1974, 1984; Viteak 1988-90: 30-31). Pedersen 1905:
386-90 cites some examples where IE *m and *n seem to develop to CS1 *u.
Although this solution is tempting for some CS1 forms, it creates several problems
elsewhere, cf. OCS bgdg, bgdesi < *bnd ‘be’ future. It has also been occasionally
proposed that IE *-un- and *-in- > CS1 *-«- ( *-y) and *-f- respectively, see 2.4.3
below.
34 MareS 1962: 20 makes it very clear that he would reconstruct a long vowel in this
ending, without giving any further explanation. Some scholars (e.g., Kuznecov
1961b: 30; Birnbaum 1970: 153) suggest a reconstruction of *-ment < *mnt for
these forms. In response it may be asked why this *-t does not appear in the oblique
2.4.2. Forms Not Explained by the Traditional Auslautgesetze 27
One instance where a nasal is often reconstructed as simply dropping
after a short vowel is the C-stem loc sg ending -e. Several scholars have
proposed that this ending is the result of the suffixing of a postposition *-en
to an original endingless loc, with subsequent loss of *-n\ see Toporov
1961: 283-84, 293-94; Kuznecov 1961b: 27, 30, 43-48; Shevelov 1964:
332; also Jasanoff 1983a: 144 fn.12; more tentatively Schelesniker 1964:
43; Aitzetmiiller 1978: 53 (but see also 5.3.10).35
5) myshhnyslu
The form mysti ‘thought’ may be cited as a possible counterexample to the
generalisation that *-ons > *-y and *-dm >*-u only in word-final position in
Common Slavic.
Toporov 1963 (see also Trubacev 1974: 21: 50) derives CS1
*mysftlmyslu from *monsl'i-/monslu- (cf. Lith mqslus ‘prudent, clever’),
which enables him to relate it to CS1 *mgdru ‘wise’ < IE *mon- \ cf. also CS1
*nuneti < IE *mn-. There are numerous IE cognates: Skt man ‘think’, Lith
manyti id, Lat mens ‘mind’; Go munan ‘mean, believe’, etc. Toporov 1963:
13 suggests the following syllabification for this form: *mons-ti-lmons-lu-.
He is therefore offering what amounts to an example of *-ons > *-y in word-
internal position, and it is startling that there has been no discussion of this
form in the scholarly literature on ALG. His explanation could be buttressed
by the fact that cross-linguistically nasals are very often dropped before spi­
rants, cf. Eng goose < *gans-, Ger Gans\ Spanish mesa < Lat mensa ‘table’.
Toporov has amassed a formidable amount of tempting semantic evi­
dence to support this etymology, but phonologically it causes many prob­
lems. In fact, Toporov leaves the phonology to the very last part of the arti­
cle, and almost dismisses it, referring back to his arguments in favour of a
development *-im-, *-in- > *-f; *-um-, *-un- > *-u- from an earlier article
(1960: 10-11). Although Toporov describes the syllabic division *mons-ti
as “entirely likely”, it is in fact, unparallelled in the rest of Slavic. In addi­
tion, even in its own terms Toporov’s explanation is inconsistent: if *-ons >
*-y had operated in this form the expected reflexes would be *myWmylu. As
is well-known, however, CS1 syllabification under the Law of Open
Syllables nearly always results in word-internal tautosyllabic *-s- being
cases: why do we not have, e.g., *vrem% - *vrem%te, instead of the attested *vrem%
- *vremene ‘time’?
35 It should also be noted that the neut *7 0 -stem ending -je is often reconstructed as
< *-jem (*-jeN) with the simple dropping of *-m (-N)\ cf. Leskien 1907: 336, see
also fn. 40.
28 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
transferred to the onset of the following syllable, cf. CS1 *nes-ti > *ne-sti
‘carry’. In that case, however, the expected development would be *monstt-
(> *mon-sti-) > *mg-sU (R *musl’\ Pol *mgsl\ Bg *masal, etc.), cf. OCS
ggsli < *ggdsli (> *gg-sli)\ R zycjiu ‘gusli’. As a further parallel, however,
Vaillant 1974: 546-47 actually cites the obscure OCS forms drgxlu and
drgselu (respectively from variant forms *drinxl- and *drinsel- ‘dismal’),
which appear to show more typical developments.
Furthermore, the very existence of the *-sl- suffix which has to be as­
sumed by Toporov is also rather problematic; the forms which seem to point
to it can all be said to have arisen by blendings, folk-etymology, etc.; cf.
Vaillant 1974: 414-15, 550-53, 558. Vaillant 1974: 558 suggests that the
correct etymology, contested by Toporov, for mysti in fact relates it to Go
gamaudjan ‘remind’; it would be derived from *myd-, and according to this
hypothesis *mgdru could be derived from the same root with a nasal infix.
This etymology is also supported by Trautmann 1923: 171-72; Vasmer
1973: 3: 25.
This form, then, is far too problematic to be used in support of *-ons >
*-y in Common Slavic; doing so creates several problems and directly con­
tradicts other evidence relating to the development of *-s- in CS1 phonol­
ogy-36
2.4.3. Typology
Another comparatively neglected problem involving the CS1 ALG is that
they run directly counter to certain tendencies which have been proposed as
putative linguistic universals, in spite of the apparent typological parallels
cited in 2.3 above.
This in itself should be no obstacle to their acceptance; one should,
however, at least attempt to explain why they should be exceptions.
Schmalstieg 1980: 17-18 urges caution in the use of typological arguments
in linguistic reconstruction. When typological evidence is used in conjunc­
tion with other types of evidence, however, it can provide a strong support
for the hypotheses under discussion. Analyses which do not make typologi­
36 Toporov 1960: 9-11 also refers to SI ryba ‘fish’ as possible support for this
etymology, which he relates to Lith rumbas, Latvian robs ‘notch’.
2.4.3. Typology 29
cal exceptions of the CS1 ALG should at least be given far more attention
than has previously been the case.37
Ruhlen 1978: 225-26 proposes that during any given period of vowel
denasalisation there is a chronological hierarchy of environments in which
nasal consonants are lost, as follows:
1) before fricative + vowel38
2) before any other consonant + vowel
3) before any other consonant + pause
4) before a pause
If one wishes to follow the order which must be reconstructed according to
the standard theory of CS1 ALG, a different order can be reconstructed:
nasal consonants before a pause would have been lost earlier than many
nasal consonants before a fricative in both internal and final syllables, e.g.,
*siinum > OCS synu - ‘son’ acc sg
would have preceded'
*gansis > OCS gQsi - ‘goose’
*jensu > OCS jqsu - ‘I took’ aorist
*zemljens > OCS zemljz - Tand(s)’ gen sg/nom/acc pi
in contrast to the order that we might expect according to typological fre­
quency.
Ruhlen further suggests that the HEIGHT of the vowel in question is im­
portant. He proposes that high nasal vowels Q and n in this instance) tend to
be the first to denasalise during a period of denasalisation. One way to bring
the SI evidence in line with these typological tendencies, therefore, would
be to propose that Slavic was first attested AFTER { and h had denasalised,
but BEFORE the lower vowels had. This approach, however, also runs into
difficulties. Shevelov 1964: 325-26, while accepting traditional theories of
ALG, draws attention to earlier theories which state that *-iN- and ^ u n ­
developed to *f and *u in Common Slavic, see also Hermann 1923: 306-08,
320; OtrQbski 1930b; Milewski 1931: 96-101, 1932: 246; Vaillant 1950:
37 One area of IE linguistics which has undoubtedly benefited from an extensive
discussion of typology is the so-called glottalic theory, on which there is already a
vast, and expanding, literature.
38 It even seems that we can subdivide fricatives: according to Ruhlen loc. cit, nasal
sonants are lost before velar fricatives prior to their loss before dental/alveolar
fricatives.
30 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
96-97, 145; Toporov 1960: 5-11; Arumaa 1964: 126-37, 1976: 53; most
recently Orel 1995, and the literature cited therein. Discussing the evidence,
and the supporting examples, Shevelov rejects this theory and states:
"... It is to be inferred from these data that *( and *ii were not
denasalised, but acquired a broader articulation so that *( coalesced
with *<£ and *n with *p ... The existence of *j and in CS1 was
probably transitory.”
I suggest that we should make this proposal of Shevelov’s apply to word-
final position in Common Slavic also, thus producing only one reflex for
any given tautosyllabic *-VN- combination, regardless of its position in the
word. In other words, this would mean that the direct phonological reflex of
both *-dm and *-ons in Common Slavic was *-g.
Another typological problem caused by the CS1 ALG is that they
assume a larger number of distinctions in word-final than in word-internal
position, cf. Feinberg 1978: 116: “ ... Common Slavic could distinguish
narrow and wide vowels before auslaut nasal sonorants at a time when this
distinction was no longer admissible in the inlaut”; Serebrennikov 1974: 65-
84, however, drawing on data from a wide variety of languages, shows that
there is actually a strong tendency towards making fewer distinctions in
word-final position than elsewhere in the word.39
One possible attested parallel to the development of the standard CS1
ALG is provided by the history of Polish, and this is cited by Poljakov 1992,
who proposes that *-VN# (short vowel + nasal) combinations simply lost
their nasal segment, while *-VN# (long vowel + nasal) combinations devel­
oped into *-y. This development is often hinted at in the scholarly literature
(Shevelov 1964: 224-26, 332-36), but rarely made so explicit: it goes back
at least to Schleicher 1852; Miklosic, who (1876: 3) states that in the acc sg
of all nouns, except the *d-stems, “ ... wird m spurlos abgeworfen...”40
Schleicher 1876: 526 states, with reference to the masc *<5-stem acc sg: “Der
39 At first sight Russian and Slovak seem to provide counterexamples to this ten­
dency In both cases, however, the exceptions are more apparent than real, see Orr
1997b: 463 fn. 22.
40 In the same passage Miklosic’s adherence to the vowel system reconstructed on
the basis of Sanskrit leads him to some errors of interpretation: on the basis of the
Skt C-stem ending -am, e.g., mataram, he traces the gen sg forms kamene ‘stone’,
matere ‘mother’, Ijubwe ‘love’, dbne ‘day’ back to kamen-e-m, mater-e-m, Ijubw-
e-m, dbti-e-m, describing them as “wahre acc.-, nicht etwa gen.-formen.” See also
Krysko 1994: 146-52.
2.4.4. Accentuation: Syncope and Apocope 31
auss lautende nasal (warscheinlich n auss m, wie im litauischen und
deutschen muss nach dem slawischen ausslautgesetze stats hinweg fallen,”
repeating this statement for the 1st sg of the aorist (1876: 650). Leskien
1876: 15-16, also proposed that nasals were dropped after short vowels in
final position. Milewski 1931: 89-90, 1932: 245, 247, 255, posits a similar
development, explicitly dating the loss of the final nasal sonants, as do
Shevelov 1964: 224-25, 332-34; Bethin 1998: 28, 44-^15.
A variant, closer typologically to the Pol development, was proposed by
Miillenhoff 1878: 438-39, who suggested that *-VlV# combinations first
developed into *-Y#, which subsequently denasalised (see 4.1.1).
The history of the Pol nasal vowels, however, does not provide a close
parallel to the CS1 ALG. On a more general level, Polish has developed a
fixed stress, making it typologically closer to Italic, Celtic, and Germanic,
while differentiating it from Common Slavic, which would have had a pitch
accent and lack of vowel reduction (see 2.4.4 below, Stieber 1973: 11, 32,
39-42, 79-82, 92-95, 104-05, 129-30; Entenman 1977: 59-63). More
specifically, Pol nasal vowels are generally PRESERVED before fricatives,
and are decomposed into sequences of V+N before stops, cf. mqz [mous]
‘man’, but glqboki [guem'boki] ‘deep’, in contrast to the proposals normally
made for Common Slavic
2.4.4. Accentuation: Syncope and Apocope
At this stage it should be emphasised that Common Slavic was a different
type of language from Common Celtic and Common Germanic, and some of
the Slavic daughter languages, in one important respect.41 Both the latter
languages had one thing in common—the gradual fixing of stress on the ini­
tial syllable of the word, accompanied by a massive reduction and syncope
(loss of internal unstressed syllables) and apocope (loss of final unstressed
syllables). For Germanic, d’Alquen 1988 does show that the process of de­
velopment towards a fixed accent was much more drawn-out and compli­
cated than is generally believed; nevertheless, the stages postulated involve
syncope, apocope, and shortenings before the fixed accent current in most
Gmc languages was achieved.
Common Slavic, on the other hand preserved a mobile stress pattern:
final and internal syllables, whether long or short, could bear the ictus. The
earliest attested Slavic (Old Church Slavonic still shows NEARLY ALL THE
41 According to Hermann 1923: 31, “das Slavische weicht in der Silbenbildung stark
von den bisher behandelten Sprachen ab.”
32 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
SYLLABLES reconstructed for its PIE ancestor, see, e.g., Arumaa 1964: 110,
passim). Long syllables can occur anywhere (e.g,,*rgka ‘hand’, *znajgsfi
‘knowing’ pres act part sf fem nom sg, etc.) and final short vowels can still
bear the stress (e.g., per'o ‘feather’), in contrast to Italic, Celtic, and
Germanic (see d’Alquen 1988: 16-17). These languages may well have had
genuine ALG because their final syllables were unstressed, and these ALG
may have corresponded to similar changes in internal syllables. Slavic pre­
served final syllables because they were stressable, like any other syllables.
For Common Slavic, therefore, we should be reluctant to propose special
developments for vowels in final syllables (see, e.g., Kurylowicz 1968: 248;
Georgiev 1969: 37) without evidence of similar reductions elsewhere.
Oddly enough, very few scholars who propose qualitative ALG for
Common Slavic have explicitly taken stress or accent into account as a fac­
tor in changes in vowel quality, specifically raising, and the ones who have
actually done so have not made their cases any more plausible. Most of the
results that they have obtained have been unsatisfactory, e.g., Hirt 1892,
1904-05; Agrell 1913; Milewski 1932; Prinz 1977; Kortlandt 1975, 1978,
1983, 1994; Schmalstieg 1983c. Hirt 1892: 348-50, 360-62, proposed that
CS1 *d was raised to *u in an unstressed final syllable, but was forced to
drop this theory because there were too many exceptions (1904-05: 292);
see also Hirt 1929: 177-78; following Hirt, Illic-Svityc 1979: 108-16, and
Vermeer 1991: 276 revived and modified it (see also 4.1.2 for fuller discus­
sion). Several such proposals seem suspiciously ad hoc: involving the postu­
lation of complicated accentual shifts in word-final syllables to explain in­
dividual forms.42 No comprehensive proposals, however, have been made
regarding stress- or accent-induced changes in vowel quality in Common
Slavic, before the fall of the jers.
In this context, one other problem which seems to have gone unnoticed
by most scholars is the wider issue of syncope in IE, and its almost total ab­
sence in Slavic before the rise of the jers, and the subsequent loss of the
weak jers. Szemerenyi 1964 provides several examples of forms in IE lan­
guages undergoing syncope in the course of their evolution, including nu­
merous ones from Greek (r|X"&ov < fjXu{fov ‘I went’ aorist; 3-29) and
Lithuanian (paskui < pasakui ‘after, afterwards’; 283). However, he offers
no such clear cases from Slavic before the loss of the weak jers.43 Meillet
42 Earlier scholars would often cite forms with tones on both syllables; Shevelov
1964: 38-80 provides some discussion, but see also fn. 15.
43 One SI form cited by Szemerenyi (399-400) that might be taken as an example of
this tendency is the word for ‘eight’, cf. OCS osrrii, Skt astau, Gk oxrcb < IE *okit-,
2.4.4. Accentuation: Syncope and Apocope 33
1916: 284-89 (see also 1965: 404-05), cites forms such as kugda ‘when’,
tugda ‘then’, attested in Old Church Slavonic, which he derives from kogda,
togda, going on to derive the -gda element in turn from goda, the gen sg of
godu ‘time’.44 He also (286-87) cites some examples where *e has been
raised to *t, e.g., sidu < *xedu, the past participle active sf masc nom sg of
iti ‘go’; *vicera ‘yesterday’ (cf. R 8nepa)/*veceru ‘evening’ (cf. R eenep,
while admitting (283) that such examples are “peu nombreux”. Vondrak
1924: 115 discusses the -gda forms, and also cites the OCS variants xoteti
and xuteti ‘want’, suggesting, however, that the reduction in the latter may
be due to its “Nebenfunktionen als Hilfsverb”, and stating that: “Fur einen
normalen ubergang des o im Wortinnem haben wir keinen sicheren Beleg”.
The issue of apocope also poses problems for the standard theory of CS1
ALG, which seem never to have been discussed. No apocope seems to be
reconstructible for Common Slavic at all before the fall of the weak jers in
final position, in contrast to other IE languages.45
Finally, although some scholars have compared the CS1 and Lat devel­
opments cited in 2.3.1 above (cf. Bopp 1875: 2: 130; Miillenhoff 1878: 433;
Fortunatov 1897: 164 fn. 1, 1957: 2: 182-85, Gauthiot 1913: 53-54;
Vondrak 1924: 115; Milewski 1932: 17, 260-61; Seliscev 1951: 149;
Arumaa 1964: 113; Spiers 1977: 65; Cekman 1979: 136; Lamprecht 1987:
81, Horalek 1992: 114; Sihler 1995: 78), they do not in fact provide a close
parallel, as was noted in passing by EndzelTns 1911: 155-56. The recon­
structed CS1 raisings of *-os and *-dm to *-us and *-um are restricted to the
in this form morphological factors may have played a role; other relevant SI forms
include OCS svekry ‘mother-in-law’, where folk etymology may also be involved
(1964: 291-318), and gospodt (1964: 382-86). Arumaa 1964: 81 cites R ymxci
‘duck’ < *gtuka, Lith antis id, comparing them to Lat anas - gen sg anatis, without,
however, citing these forms as an example of BS1 syncope as such. One other
example might be provided by forms such as OCS pastoruka ‘stepdaughter’, Sin
pasterka, if from *pa-duktoritka, as sometimes proposed, see Trubacev 1959: 58 for
critical discussion. It cannot be denied, however, that Slavic furnishes very few
examples of this phenomenon compared to other IE languages, in this instance even
Baltic.
44 This etymology is disputed, cf. Vasmer 1973: 2: 274-75, 4: 69.
45 Havranek 1926: 365, followed and elaborated by Christol 1997, suggests that
certain forms in Slavic (e.g., the CS1 infinitive in *-ti, contrasted with the majority
of its reflexes in the modern languages, which have -t’ (cf. R -mb, Pol -c, etc.),
certain particles) might be seen as originating in variation between apocopated and
non-apocopated forms. These developments, however, properly belong to very late
Common Slavic, or the history of the individual SI languages.
34 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
final syllable, whereas the Lat change is part of a thoroughgoing restructur­
ing of the vowel system, involving both syncope and apocope; all vowels
are affected, and the changes can be seen in internal as well as final sylla­
bles. See Orr 1988: 52-53 for further details.
Another false parallel between Common Slavic and Latin, although not
one that is often cited, can be seen in their treatment of word-final nasal
sonants: final *-m in Latin was very weakly articulated, possibly with some
accompanying nasalisation, as can be seen from rules of scansion, textual
evidence, etc., and had vanished completely before the development of
Latin into Romance, except in some monosyllables, see 2.4.6 below. This
loss of *-m took place before the loss of some dental stops (still preserved in
Sardinian, see 2.4.7 below).
There are two divergences from the CS1 developments here, however:
1) There is another common tendency involving word-final *-m: devel­
opment to *-n (*-iV); this was very probably the route taken by
Common Slavic. Latin did not follow this tendency (cf. nomen
‘name’, tamen ‘however’, but centum ‘hundred’).
2) With the exception of monosyllables, all word-final *-m in Latin fol­
lowed the same route; there are no cases of some forms developing
into non-nasals and some to nasals, in contrast to Common Slavic ac­
cording to the standard theory of ALG.
2.4.5. Long Diphthongs
The question of whether to reconstruct long diphthongs at any stage of
Common Slavic is complicated. This is another area of SI historical phonol­
ogy where no scholarly consensus appears to have been reached. Some
scholars (especially Schmalstieg 1965: 238, 1968a, 1974b: 20-21, 309-10,
1976: 164-65; 1983a: 270, 1983b: 39) would date the loss of any long diph­
thongs back to the BS1 period; others, e.g., Shevelov 1964: 25, 78, 224-25,
266-67, would use them to explain developments which took place much
later. In this context it should be noted that “long diphthongs” usually refers
to *-VN(S)# combinations; apart from a few isolated examples, which can
easily admit of morphological explanations, more so than the examples cited
here (cf. the *o-stem dat sg and inst pi) long *-i and *-u diphthongs in
Common Slavic present far fewer problems.
Milewski 1932: 2-16, 243-44, devotes some space to long diphthongs,
and suggests that four problematic endings may be explained by citing dif­
ferent developments for long and short diphthongs and dialectal differences
between North and South Slavic: 1) the *o-stem instr pi; 2) the masc nom sg
2.4.5. Long Diphthongs 35
pres act part sf; 3) the *d-stem acc pi; 4) the masc nom sg *n-stem. He sug­
gests that in North Slavic long diphthongs in closed final syllables (e.g.,
*-dis, *-dnt, *-ans) simply lost their second component and
developed into the corresponding long vowels (*-ds, *-dt, *-ds, *-as, all of
which would later have developed to *-u > *-y; 1932: 6-8), whereas South
Slavic shared only developments 1) and 4) with North Slavic, and shortened
the long diphthongs in 2) and 3). Milewski suggested that these divergent
developments may have been due to morphological factors; however, this
proposal causes several problems.46 Mathiassen 1974: 4-5, following Stang
1966: 186, adduces some evidence which seems to show that the shortening
of long diphthongs took place independently in Baltic and Slavic. For
relatively recent scholarship, the lack of consensus may be illustrated by
juxtaposing the views of Shevelov 1964 and Jasanoff 1983a, 1983b.
Shevelov 1964: 25 states that “... in word-final position (in endings) long
nasal diphthongs were spared [shortening—RAO]”, whereas, e.g., Jasanoff
1983a: 144 states that: “as in Latin and Old Irish, pre-Slavic regularly short­
ened sequences of the type *-VN to *-VN in final position.”47
Shevelov’s reconstruction of long nasal diphthongs for Common Slavic
in word-final position, while simultaneously adhering to the standard theory
of ALG, carries with it several difficulties. He proposes that nasal sonants in
word-final position after short vowels were lost before the shortening of
long diphthongs. He argues (1964: 225):
“A slight weakening of articulation in the word-final position may
be more convincingly expected for a period when final syllables ...
were thoroughly unstressed .... This is the most plausible period
for final nasal consonants preceded by a short vowel to have been
dropped. Long vowels precluded such a slackening of word-final
articulations.”
The question immediately arises: why should long nasal diphthongs
(*-V7V#) retain their length in word-final position when everything else in
that position, including other long diphthongs, e.g., OCS zene (< *-ai)
‘woman’ dat/ loc sg; Gk xipp (< *-ai) ‘honour’ dat sg, contrasted with OCS
levu (< *-ai) ‘left’; Gk *kaiFog (< *-ai) id, is subject to shortening, or
indeed, apocope? As we saw in 2.4.4, in the history of other IE languages
46 Milewski 1932: 15 suggests that differing developments of long diphthongs in
final position may be seen in the forms doma ‘home’ and domu ‘house’ loc sg.
47 The position looks much more straightforward from the point of view of a
Latinist; see Sihler 1995: 78.
36 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
with large-scale reductions in final position, (e.g., Celtic, Germanic) such
sequences are not immune to shortening—quite the reverse, in fact, e.g.,
OHG salbom > Ger salben ‘to anoint’; CCel *maqdm > Ogam maqa ‘sons’
gen pi. There is a problem here also.
Jasanoff’s reconstruction of a shortening of *-V7V# sequences to *-VN#
is also very problematic. It is primarily invoked to explain the postulated
development of *-om to *-om in the CS1 gen pi form. Quite simply, it runs
into the same difficulties, albeit on a larger scale, as many of the other pro­
posals which incorporate ALG in the reconstruction of Common Slavic: it
appears as though there have been no parallel developments anywhere else.
To put it another way, why were ALL such sequences not shortened? In any
case, why do we have nasal vowels in word-final position in Slavic at all, if
ALL *-VN# sequences were shortened, subsequently to develop according to
the ALG *-dm > *-u, *-'im > *-i, etc.?
The development of *-VN- combinations after Ijl should be briefly con­
sidered here. As stated above, according to the framework outlined in this
monograph, all *-aN, *-oN, *-uN (*-aN, *-dN, *-iiN) should have developed
into *-g; after ///, however, *-aN, *-dN, *-uN, *-uN should have developed
into *-jq by various routes, while *-aN, *-dN should have developed into
*-jg, thus enabling us in some cases to distinguish between *-VN-
and *-V7V- (*-jg-). In this context it should be noted that most of the
occurrences of the sequence *-jg- are in endings; Shdvelov 1964: 262 fn. 6
and Darden 1970: 459 state that *-jg- is never attested in roots, which might
lend support to the hypothesis of a general shortening of long diphthongs in
Common Slavic (although not immune, roots would be less subject to mor­
phological and analogical pressures than endings). Mares 1963: 8 fn. 7 cites
the OCS adverbial forms jqdu(ze) and jgde(ze) ‘where’. There are a very
few examples of actual roots containing *jg (e.g., (pa)jqc(ina) ‘spider’s
web’), but these can all be explained without recourse to proposing the
preservation of long diphthongs in internal syllables.
I suggest that as a general rule, tautosyllabic long diphthongs were
shortened everywhere in Common Slavic, but that they were maintained in
certain forms in order to preserve distinctions of number, gender, and case
(cf. especially the fem *a-stem acc sg; if it had been subject to the shorten­
2.4.6. The Treatment of Monosyllables 37
ing of long diphthongs, it would have become indistinguishable from the
masc *o-stem acc sg; see 3 fn. 42, 4, and 5.2.2 below for more detail).48
2.4.6. The Treatment of Monosyllables
Surprisingly, another comparatively neglected area in the study of CS1 ALG
is the treatment of monosyllables, although scattered comments date back to
at least Schleicher 1852: 56. This becomes more startling when one consid­
ers that elsewhere in IE monosyllables behave differently from forms of
more than one syllable in their treatment of the sounds normally considered
as subject to ALG, and that this is often accorded special discussion in com­
parative grammars, cf. Pedersen 1909: 246, 250, 294; Lewis and Pedersen
1961: 64-67 (Celtic); d’Alquen 1988: 15-16 (Germanic); Sihler 1995: 49,
228-29 (Latin). In Germanic monosyllables were often spared the large-
scale reduction seen elsewhere with short vowels, e.g., OE pcet ‘that’ < *tod,
preserving -r (< IE *-d), contrasted with its OCS cognate to, also < *tod\
OHG den ‘the’ masc acc sg, preserving -n (< IE *-m). In Old Icelandic short
final vowels in monosyllables were lengthened, e.g., sva < *sva ‘thus’. Old
Irish showed the same development with stressed monosyllables, see
Thurneysen 1946: 32. In Celtic final *-d may well have been retained in ac­
cented monosyllables, e.g., OIr cid ‘what’, cf. Lat quid, in contrast to losses
of final dental stops elsewhere, e.g., OIr -beir < IE *bheret ‘s/he bears’, al­
though see Gauthiot 1913: 66; Thurneysen 1946: 110, 284, 292 for caution­
ary notes. In Lat *-o~ developed to *-u- in monosyllables before *-r, e.g.,
cur < quor ‘why’, and final *-d was preserved longer in monosyllables than
elsewhere, cf. med (later > me) ‘me’, possibly also sed ‘but’ (Sihler 1995:
229); in monosyllables long vowels maintained their length before -l and -r,
whereas in polysyllables they were shortened (Sihler 1995: 79); French pre­
serves a trace of Lat final -m in monosyllables such as rien ‘nothing’ < Lat
rem ‘thing’ acc sg; mien ‘mine’ < Lat meum id, while losing it in other envi­
ronments, as do Spanish and Portuguese (quien ‘who’ and quern respec­
tively; Lat quern id).
Slavic, however, shows NO special treatment of monosyllables whatever
according to the standard reconstruction of ALG.
48 Cf. Masc *o-stem Fem *a-stem
Nom Sg *vlkas ‘wolf’ *zend ‘wife’
Acc Sg *vlkdm " *z.enam "
The acc sg endings would have been distinguished by length, cf. Stankiewicz 1977
(see also 3.5.1, 5.2.2, 5.4).
38 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
At this point it might be noted that one of Berneker’s implied criticisms
of Hirt 1892 (1904: 371-73) is that Hirt does not seem to allow for the fact
that monosyllables almost certainly bore the stress, cf. under the standard
theory of ALG, *tom always > tu, never *tg; Berneker 1904: 373 points to
examples from Old Church Slavonic where the actually attested tu almost
indisputably would have borne sentence stress (both in the nom and acc),49
see also Hujer 1910: 14; Gauthiot 1913: 63-77 devoted a whole chapter to
monosyllables, giving examples of divergent development, although citing
very little SI material therein. Milewski 1932: 229, 234-38 made some brief
comments on the development of monosyllables in Common Slavic, mainly
from the point of view of accentuation, suggesting that monosyllables did
not undergo the same shortenings as polysyllables in word-final position,
without, however, citing any actual examples. Schelesniker 1964: 52-53 re­
peats Berneker’s criticisms. Shevelov 1964: 225 hints that monosyllables
might not have been subject to certain developments that he proposes for
Common Slavic, but does not go beyond these hints. Arumaa 1976: 52-53
discusses monosyllabic prepositions, suggesting that they are subject to spe­
cial sentence stress and not subject to rules governing word-final position in
polysyllabic words (see also 2.4.7). Partly building on Gauthiot loc. cit.,
Serebrennikov 1974: 12, 66, 82-84 cites numerous examples, both from in­
side and outside IE, where monosyllables have preserved final consonants
lost in polysyllables, and even undergone some strengthening. Schmalstieg
1986b: 381 suggests the possibility that CS1 monosyllables may have devel­
oped variant forms thus:’ ... it seems quite probable to me that differences
in sentence stress may have given rise to various doublets in Proto-Slavic
such as *o-stem nom.acc. dual *ta (stressed), *ty (unstressed) < *td; acc. sg.
masc.-fem. *tg (stressed), *tb (unstressed) < *tun < *toN (*o-stem) and
*taN (*d-stem). A later reassignment of function led to the establishment of
tb as masculine and tg as feminine).” He does not develop the idea further.50
The most substantial proposal regarding monosyllables in Common
Slavic is probably Otrqbski 1954: 28-29; he modified the oft-proposed CS1
ALG *-d# > *-u# (*-y), by which he explained, e.g., the masc *meti-stem
49 OCS ty < *tu ‘you’ sg might also be noted in this context as showing a length­
ening similar to the regular phenomenon noted for Old Icelandic; many cognate
forms (OHG du) point to IE *tu\ see Gauthiot 1913: 72-73.
50 Many of these discussions of monosyllables are in fact distilled from scattered
comments, and require a good deal of trawling through the relevant comparative
grammars, and interpretation of hints, cf. Lewis and Pedersen’s (1961: 65) refer­
ences to “words of more than one syll.”, “polysyllables”.
2.4.6. The Treatment of Monosyllables 39
nom sg form -y, cf. OCS kamy < *kamd ‘stone’ (see also 4.9, 5.5); there
were also forms where the original ending would have been lost through
morphological factors, such as, e.g., the *d-stem inst sg form, e.g, *plody
(the attested form plodortu is a later remodelling) ‘fruit’ instr sg, and the 1st
sg present form nesg ‘I carry’ (originally *nesy, remodelled for morphologi­
cal reasons). His refinement was to suggest that this ALG did not apply to
monosyllables, where *-d in word-final position would have developed to
*-a, and not to *-y.
The masc *o-stem nom/acc du forms in -a, however, constitute a serious
objection to this theory, cf. OCS grada < *gVrdo ‘city’ nom/acc du.
Otrqbski 1954: 29 proposed that this was in fact the result of an analogical
development; the *-a retained in monosyllabic du pronominal forms, e.g.,
OCS masc nom du ta < *to, would have subsequently been restored in poly­
syllabic du forms.
Although Otrqbski’s proposals deserve very serious consideration, his
ultimate solution is unsatisfactory for the following reasons:
1) Forms such as *kama ‘stone’, which show the expected development
*-o > *-a, are left unexplained (see also 5.5).
2) The CS1 form *vicera ‘yesterday’ (R onepa) < *vekerd is often seen as
an old instr in *-<?, cf. Vasmer 1973: 1: 366 and the literature cited
therein, according to Otrqbski, we should expect *vtcery.
Most scholars have ignored Otrqbski’s proposal, but see Arumaa 1964: 78.
Two other forms may also be discussed in this context: the pronouns ny
(‘we’ acc pi) and vy (‘you’ acc pi). These are often derived from IE *nds
and *vds, cf. the respective gen/loc pi forms nasu < *nds-u and vasu < *vds-
u (see 6.1.1 below for the reconstruction of the ending), Lat nos, vos. It is
often suggested that pronominal declension is more archaic than nominal
declension, but see also Lunt 1981: 36, 1987: 280.
These forms should be viewed in conjunction with their respective
paradigms thus (Diels 1932: 214):
Table 2-5
1st Du 1st PI 2nd Du 2nd PI
Nom ve my va vy
Acc na, ny ny, nasu va, vy vy, vasu
Gen naju nasu vaju vasu
Loc naju nasu vaju vasu
Dat nama namu, ny vama, va vamu
Instr nama nami vama, va vami
40 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
These forms are not discussed nearly as often as the nominal declensional
forms. Schleicher 1852: 283 suggested that the -y in ny, vy could be derived
directly from *-as, and that it could be seen as a “ ... starkerer vertreter von
urspr. -as als das regelmaBig fiir auBlautendes -as eintretende r>.” He pointed
out that “... auBer der einsylbigkeit noch der umstand hinzu, daB in den inen
zu grunde liegenden formen nas, mas, vas -as nicht bloBe casusendung ist;
hier vermied die sprache die auBerste verkiirzung und lieB es bei dem abfall
des s von den vorauBgesetzten zwischenstufen nus, mus, vus und der ver-
wandlung des u in 6/ bewenden”: words which recall the proposed behav­
iour of monosyllables in Celtic, Germanic, and Latin-Romance as described
above. Meillet 1965: 455 derived ny, vy directly from *nds, *vds, utilising
the ALG *-os > *-y, while allowing for the possibility of reconstructing
*-ns, based primarily on OPr mans, vans id, see also Schmalstieg 1976: 196,
and 5.2.4.
2.4.7. Historical Ordering/Relative Chronology
The CS1 ALG also entail several problems with relative chronology, some
of which have been accorded some discussion, and others of which have
been only hinted at or remained unnoticed.
First, there is the question of the order in which final consonants were
lost as the Law of the Open Syllable played itself out in Common Slavic.
The only final consonants that can be reconstructed with a reasonable
degree of reliability for Common Slavic are *-g ,51 *-b,52 *-t(*-d), *-N (*-«,
*-m), *-r,53 *-s (*-z). It seems certain that they were not all lost at the same
time. Ferguson 1975: 182 suggests that as a general rule “ ... nasal
consonants are among the last word-final consonants to be lost ...”, but this
statement deserves some further scrutiny. Bethin 1998: 28 proposes a hier­
archy of increasing sonority:
voiceless stops - voiced stops/voiceless fricatives - voiced fricatives -
nasals - liquids - glides/high vowels - vowels
51 Final *-g for Slavic may be reconstructed on the basis of Russian, Polish, etc. ja
‘I’, < NIE *eg, cf. Lith as, OIc ekid, etc., see Hamp 1983, 6.1.2.
52 As in the preposition o ~ ob.
53 The actual reconstruction of *-r might be said to be less well-grounded than *-g;
forms on which it is based, such as, e.g., CS1 *mater ‘mother’ might be better re­
constructed without it, cf. Skt mata id, Lith mote ‘wife’. But cf. OCS i ‘and’ < *ir,
cf. Lith ir id
2.4.7. Historical Ordering/Relative Chronology 41
She suggests that in word-final position “obstruents were more likely to be
lost than sonorants” ... less sonorous syllable-final consonants would be lost
before more sonorous ones, i.e., obstruents would tend to disappear before
nasals or liquids.”
The crucial question revolves around the relative chronology of the
losses of *-N and *-t, which has been accorded some discussion in the
literature. Hirt 1892: 363 dated the loss of *-t to Balto-Slavic (“lit.-slavisch”
in his terminology), as did Fortunatov 1897: 164 fn. 1, 1957: 2: 182-85, this
removed exceptions to his proposal that CS1 *-o- was raised to *-u- in a
final closed syllable (see 4.1.1 below).
Brugmann 1904: 280, however, saw the loss of *-t, *-d as “... nicht
urbaltoslavisch”, citing *-ont > *-q, *-int > *-<*, but later on (1904: 376) he
seems to contradict himself by suggesting that *-t, *-d dropped before the
changes *-os, *-dm > *-us, *-um, citing Fortunatov, Bemeker, and Pedersen.
Endzellns 1911: 28 states that the presence of a nasal in the aorist shows that
final dental stops were not lost as early as the BS1 period. Following
Endzellns, Vondrdk 1924: 477, however, suggests that *-t in Common
Slavic was lost earlier than *-N. Gauthiot 1913: 46, 48-49, following
Fortunatov for Lithuanian and Slavic, suggested that further typological
parallels could be found in Germanic and Armenian (1913: 58, 59, 60).
Kuznecov 1953: 67-68, 1961b: 30, 48, 64, 97, also followed Fortunatov in
his dating of the loss of *-t, noting some implications of that relative
chronology.
Arumaa 1976: 51-53 offers a brief discussion of the chronology, using
the evidence of monosyllables to date the loss of *-t before *-5 (see also
2.4.6). Unlike most other scholars, he does not separate the loss of *-m after
short vowels from nasalisation, and suggests that chronologically the loss of
the nasal in prepositions and prefixes “kann nicht besonders alt sein”, and
goes on to say that the loss of the nasal in *-ons accompanied by lengthen­
ing (*-ons > *-uns > *-iis > *-y) is a “Sonderfall, der fur die allgemeine
Geschichte des Nasals nicht viel besagt.”
Mikkola 1921: 16, however, proposed the following order: 1) *-r (... de
l’epoque indo-europeenne), 2) *-t, *-d, 3) *-s 4) nasals after short vowels.
Milewski 1932: 245-46 suggested that the loss of *-t could not be earlier
than the loss of *-m and *-n\ in his summary (1932: 255) he groups them
together. Shevelov 1964: 229, 633, offers the following summarised
chronology:
42 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
1) *-r (“2000-1500 BC or earlier; dialectal IE or very early CS1”);
2) *-N (“Before the 1st century BC”),54
3) *-t, *-d (“Beginning of Christian era”),
4) *-s, *-x (“6th century AD”).
He (1964: 226) suggests that losses of final dental stops may have taken
place independently in Baltic and Slavic, but points out that “ ... It is charac­
teristic that as a result of these independent developments final dental stops
were not admitted in the extensive area from the Baltic to the Mediterranean
(Gr [Greek—RAO] also lost its final t and d) during a certain time.” See
also Bernstejn 1961, 1974; Cekman 1979: 135; Kortlandt 1979: 262, 1983:
169, 174;55Vermeer 1991: 277-78; Lunt 1981: 44-45, 1993: 377 (Lunt
1981 suggests that “... word-final *d could have been lost early, but ... *t
remained nearly to the end of the pre-historic period.”, but in his 1993 arti­
cle he groups t d r together, in contrast to most other scholars), 379 fn. 21.
Ferrell 1965: 97 sums up the main, oft-cited, criticism of dating the loss
of *-t earlier than that of the nasals:
“This part of the theory proved untenable in the absence of special
developments of some kind to differentiate the reflex of Protoslavic
*-int > <
*
, from *-in > -b and of *-ont > -g from *-on >
Fortunatov’s device ... is not altogether a happy one.”
Vermeer 1991: 278 refers to the “unpleasant elements” and “unsolved diffi­
culties” involved in this issue.
If *-t actually had been lost in the BS1 period, the 3rd pi aorist would not
have been differentiated from other forms in *-on (*-dm; both would have
fallen together in *-oN). The SI aorist would therefore have had a similar
paradigm to the Gk imperfect and strong aorist, e.g.,
Common Slavic cf. Greek
1st Sg *mogon ‘I could’ aorist eX
.uov ‘I released’ imperfect
3rd PI *mogon ‘they could’ aorist e/.uov ‘they released’ imperfect
54 There is an inconsistency in Shevelov’s presentation here, although it does not
affect the relative chronology; on 1964: 229 he dates the loss of *-IVto “before the
first century B.C.”, while on 1964: 633 he dates it to “before the first century A.D.”
55 Kortlandt’s approach actually does show a way of maintaining the order 1) *-t 2)
*-N\ he suggests the raising of *-<5- to *-u- in word-final *-6m took place before the
loss of *-t (1983: 174), but that the loss of *-t took place before the loss of *-m
(1979: 262, 264-65).
2.4.7. Historical Ordering/Relative Chronology 43
According to the standard theory of ALG, therefore, the CS1 forms would
both have developed to *mogu, instead of the 1st sg rnogit - 3rd pi mogg ‘be
able to’ that we actually find (see also 2.4.2, 6.1.3).
There is also the problem of the neut sf nom sg pres act part in *-y. If *-t
had been dropped prior to *-N we would expect a development, e.g.,
*nesont> *nesdN > *nesuN > *nesu, and with the reverse sequence we
would expect a development *nesont > *nesQ ‘they carry’ present. The form
that is actually attested, nesy, shows that some sort of morphological re­
structuring must have taken place.
The typological evidence from elsewhere in IE is inconclusive, with
support for both possible sequences: as we have seen, Baltic shows the order
1) *-t 2) nasal sonants 3) *-s, see Stang 1966: 114, who suggests that the
same order holds for Slavic. Romance and Germanic, however, mainly point
to the following order of loss of final consonants: 1) nasal sonants 2) *-t, 3)
*-s. In fact, Sardinian still preserves some final Lat *-t, although all Lat final
*-m have been lost, although this is misleading. For Latin itself, e.g.,
Sommer 1914: 273-7'8; 299-306, Sihler 1995: 227-31 show that the evolu­
tion was quite complicated; with several stages, and attested material show­
ing some free variation; it is difficult to tell which order either of them
would propose. As I have argued in 2.4.4 above, however, the fact that Latin
did not follow the development of *-m > *-n (*-N) suggests that its evidence
should be treated with caution.
The Gmc evidence is complicated by the fact that *-t would have
probably developed into a dental fricative before dropping, and therefore it
should perhaps be grouped with *-s. The Cel material is even more difficult,
partly due to the effects of lenition and eclipsis, see, e.g., Lewis and
Pedersen 1961: 64-68; Thurneysen 1946: 109-11, although it should be
mentioned that final *-nt is preserved (in OIr > *-d (orthographic -t)), cf.
OIr det ‘tooth’, Welsh dant id < *dnt.
It therefore appears that the order 1) nasal sonants 2) *-t, 3) *-.v cannot
be taken at face value: both Latin and Germanic show special developments
which make them of less value as typological controls for Common Slavic.
Greek is actually attested at a stage where *-t (along with other final
stops) has been lost, but nasal sonants (-« < *-n, *-m), *-s, and *-r are pre­
served. The comparative evidence points to the loss of *-t before the earliest
attestations (but see Sihler 1995: 227). Hittite also shows a very early loss of
*-t in some forms (although final IE *-t is generally preserved in Hittite),
while *-n and *-s are preserved, e.g., adan < *adant ‘eating’, cf. Ivanov and
Gamkrelidze 1995: 162.
44 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
It should also be noted that “loss of final *-N”, according to the standard
ALG, is a very different process from “nasalisation”. The two are separated
by a long period; Shevelov 1964: 224-25, 326-37, 633 dates the “loss of
final N after short vowels” six centuries before the “rise of nasal vowels”.
The justification for positing two separate processes is not immediately ap­
parent. As discussed above, adducing length and stress (see also 2.4.4) as a
factor creates problems. Entenman 1977 examines a wide range of data from
several languages and concludes (1977: 62): “... when a language develops
nasal vowels from VN sequences, all syllable final VN become nasal vowels
and lose their nasal consonant at the same time .... we have found no coun­
terevidence to this principle.”
Finally, some scholars have noted that the tendencies which led to the
losses of final consonants are continuing in certain areas of Slavic. Popovic
1955: 119, cites in passing examples from SC dialects which show the loss
of dental stops appearing in final position after the loss of the weak jers
(e.g., naro < narod\ cf. OCS narodu ‘people’; pu < put cf. OCS pgfi ‘way’)
quoted by Bernstejn 1963: 61. Popovic does not pursue the matter in his
1960 work. The development of final *-m to -n in some SC and Sin dialects
might also be seen as the repeat of a CS1 process, although Popovic (1955:
131, 1960: 561-62) ascribes it to Italian influence. In his description of the
Rezja dialects of Slovenian (which also show a tendency t.o merge *-n and
*-m) Baudouin de Courtenay devoted some space to the loss of final conso­
nants, which seems to have been an ongoing process. He specifically (1875:
342) points out that “... the very same process is repeated whereby the first
(main) epoch of the independent existence of Slavic is marked, in contrast to
the Common Lituano-Slavic period.” He does not discuss the relative
chronology of the losses, but the examples of the loss of *-t and *-d that he
cites are far more numerous than those of the loss of *-n and *-m (1875:
335-41).
It therefore appears on balance more likely that the SI sequence of the
loss of final consonants was 1) *-t (*-d) 2) *-s, with the development of
*-VN > Y closer chronologically to the loss of *-s, see Orr 1997b: 461-72
for some further examples and discussion. Taken together with the other fac­
tors, this poses a further problem for the standard theory of CS1 ALG.
One neglected, albeit crucial, issue of chronology, involves the
masc/fem *jo-/ja-stem acc pi ending *-/?. Under the traditional framework,
there are at least three stages to be considered, although nearly all studies
which touch on this aspect of the problem cite only two, cf. Leskien 1907:
2.4.7. Historical Ordering/Relative Chronology 45
336-37; Vermeer 1991: 111', this creates a problem which has not been ac­
corded the scrutiny that it deserves.565

The forms cited are normally used to SUPPORT ALG, nevertheless, if
placed in their proper chronological context they actually create serious
problems. Apart from *-om > *-u and *-ons > *-y (or rather the first stage
thereof, *-8- > *-u- ), there are two other sound changes which should be
considered in this context:
a) the merger of IE *a and *8 into CS1 *d > *o51
b) the change *-j&- > *-je/ *-ju- > *-jt- in Common Slavic
Where do the various stages of *-om >*-u and *-ons >*-y stand in relation
to these sound changes?58 Change (a) is clearly very ancient: it occurs not
only in Slavic, but also in Baltic, Germanic, Albanian, and Indo-Iranian.
Change (b) is unique to Slavic, and clearly more recent than (a). This raises
a serious problem, which has been pointed out several times in the literature:
Streitberg 1892: 285-89; Hirt 1892: 344; Leskien 1907: 336; Ferrell 1965:
102 show that *-o- > *-u- must have occurred AFTER (b) in order to account
for the acc pi ending of the *jo- and *ja-stems (OCS mgz^ ‘men’ acc pi <
*mongjens < *mongjons). Several authors (Mikkola 1913: 72, van Wijk
1950: 298; Kuznecov 1961b: 72; Schelesniker 1964: 54; Shevelov 1964:
156 with some reservations; Kortlandt 1979: 262-63, 1983: 180; Lunt 1981:
83), however, would date *-8- > *-u- BEFORE (a). Such a position is almost
dictated by the reflex of the fem acc sg *a-stem ending *-q < *-am (< *-am),
whether a long or short vowel is reconstructed for this ending. Shevelov
1964: 633 does not treat *-om > *-u in his Synopsis as a single sound
change, but from other remarks in the same work it may be assumed that he
would date the raising of *-8- to *-u- before a nasal well before the merger
of *d and *a, and the dropping of the final nasal (i.e., *-um > *-u) just after
56 Schelesniker 1964: 54 does mention the three sound-changes together, but does
not pursue the implications.
57 Baltic merges IE *a and *o, but keeps IE *a and *d apart, cf. Lith stoti ‘stand’ <
IE *sta-\ duodu ‘I give’ present < IE *do-.
58 It might also be noted that Shevelov 1964: 229, in discussing CS1 losses of final
consonants shared by neighbouring languages, notes that the proposed loss of final
*-N, so important for the standard ALG, was not shared by any of the coeval neigh­
bours of Common Slavic, in contrast to all the other such losses proposed (cf. the
loss of *-r shared with Baltic and Indo-Iranian; the loss of final dental stops shared
with Baltic and Germanic; the loss of final *-s, *-x shared with Romanian,
Dalmatian, etc.). Elsewhere in the same chapter (225) he states that “ ... the loss of
-N cannot be linked to the trend toward simplification of consonant clusters.”
46 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
the merger. He dates (b) some five or six centuries later, long after *-o-
would have been raised to Shevelov himself hints that there are many
difficulties involved in these reconstructions.
Some scholars try to rescue the situation by dating the raising of *-o- to
*-n- AFTER the merger of *-6- and *-a~. This is the approach adopted by
Feinberg 1978: 110, which leads to the proposal of a sound-change *-aN >
*-UN in final position.59 Schmalstieg 1979 points to a possibly similar phe­
nomenon in Hittite, suggesting that such a sound change might be consid­
ered a universal tendency. Feinberg goes on to date the fronting of vowels
after *-j- later than the raising of *-d- to this would imply the fronting
of *-u- to *-(- in the relevant forms rather than *-8- (*-d-) to *-e-. If fronting
after *-j- is dated later than the raising of *-d- to *-u- in final syllables, it is
necessary to propose that syllable-initial *-j- preserved the nasal quality of
the vowel in order to account for the ending *-jg, which preserves the
nasalisation, in contrast to the ending *-y, which is usually reconstructed as
having lost it at some stage. Also, according to the traditional theory of CS1
ALG, *-ins not preceded by *-j- would have had to develop into *-/, e.g.,
OCS gosti ‘guests’ acc pi < *gostins (see, e.g., Ferrell 1965: 102; Shevelov
1971a: 55, fn. 11), in contrast to the proposed development *-jins > *-jg.
In this instance the problem is one of simple phonetic plausibility: why
should a Ijl in syllable-initial position preserve nasality? There are admitted
instances of Ijl preserving the following syllable where without Ijl that syl­
lable would have been dropped,60 but as far as I know, none (apart from
certain variations of the standard theory of CS1 ALG) where Ijl would pre­
serve nasalisation. It should also be noted that Ijl here is proposed to be
PRESERVING nasalisation in a position where its LOSS is attested many
times, i.e., before a fricative (-5); see, e.g., Foley 1975: 197, 199-200, 210-
11; Ruhlen 1978: 225-26.
Building on Kortlandt 1978: 286-87, 1979: 262, 265, 1983: 182-83 (see
also Kortlandt 1994: 95, 99), Vermeer 1991: 277 attempts to deal with the
chronological problem by separating the raising in *-dm > *-u from the
raising in *-ons > *-y. He notes the problems discussed above (especially
59 Some liberties have been taken with Feinberg’s notation here; he actually uses o
for *d(d) and o for *a(o).
60 In Old Irish a final syllable with *-j- was preserved (e.g., guide ‘prayer’ < *-jos),
whereas the same syllable without *-j- would have been lost (e.g,,fer ‘man’ < *-os).

the relative chronology of the loss of final dental stops), and dates *-dm >
*-u to the BS1 period, and *-ons >*-y later.6
1
This proposal does partially solve the problems of chronology, but while
at least the issues have been faced, other problems have been raised in turn.
The most substantial of these is as follows: just what exactly is the justifica­
tion for separating these parts of what appears to be the same sound-change?
Kortlandt and Vermeer accord this part of the question very little discussion.
It is significant that Vermeer 1991: 277 outlines three alternatives:
“(a) The jo-stem endings did in fact develop exactly as theory
demands (e.g., accusative singular *kone), but were subsequently
removed by morphological processes (e.g. Ferrell 1965, in par­
ticular p. 107)
(b) The jo-stem endings do not reflect *-ios and *-iom, but *-is
and *-im, both of which yield phonetically -b in accordance with
the attested forms (e.g., Leskien 1891: 327-28).
(c) The raising in *-dm > has to be separated from that in
*-ons and to be assigned to a stage preceding the Umlaut.”
without mentioning another possibility: abandoning *-dm > *-u and *-ons >
*-y altogether in the reconstruction of Common Slavic.
Another problem is posed by Germanic, where *-d- and *-a- also
merged: where would this merger fit in? Is it independent of the Balto-
Slavic developments? If not, then would *-dm > *-u fit into the history of
Germanic as well?
One cannot avoid the conclusion that, having seen, and faced, the prob­
lem, Vermeer appears to be attempting to save the postulated raisings in
*-dm > *-u and *-otis > *-y, rather than looking at the question through
fresh eyes.62
61 In my Ph.D. thesis (Orr 1983: 86) I erroneously stated that Kortlandt is forced to
date the raising of *-d- to *-u- to Balto-Slavic, without separating the raising of *-d
> *-u in *-dm from that in *-ons.
62Pedersen 1905: 325 refers to such a chronological ordering in passing, but does
not develop the idea, and, in any case, leaves the merger of IE *<J and *d out of the
picture.
48 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
2.5. Alternative Explanations
2.5.1. Alleged Evidence for a Sound-Change *-om > *-o
Once in a while, the proposal that the regular reflex of CS1 *-dm was *-o
surfaces in the literature. As with the linking of *-en > *-e to the C-stem loc
sg, it appears to be mainly based on the correspondence Lat -um, Gk -ov,
Skt -am, etc. < IE *-om > SI *-o, thus seeing the CS1 neut nom/acc sg
ending -o as the regular phonological reflex of IE *-om, independent of
considerations of stress as proposed by, e.g., Hirt 1892, or sandhi as
proposed by, e.g., OtrQbski 1930a.636
4This is the position adopted by Liidtke
1966: 133-34; Georgiev 1969: 53, and suggested, somewhat more
tentatively by Panzer 1978: 86. Vermeer 1991: 277, fn. 7 rightly points to
the problems caused by adhering to this theory, without considering that *-
dm >*-u itself may also cause similar problems.
2.5.2. Strict Rule Ordering
Velceva 1988: 38-67 takes a generative approach to the problem: the strict
ordering of the relevant rules, following the approach used by Halle and
Lightner, cited by Channon 1972: 34-37, 42, and Lunt 1981, 1987.54
Oddly enough, despite the fact that this approach would seem to be a
natural response to the issues in 2.4.7 above, it has not yet been applied to
the serious chronological problem (the merger of IE'*<2 and *8; the raising
of *-8- to *-w-; the fronting after *-_/-) discussed in that subsection. In fact,
Velceva starts off from CS1 *d, without mentioning IE *a and *8, and is
forced into making the *-j- preserve nasalisation, without any explanation,
and several other little inconsistencies.65
63As we have seen above, the proposal that stressed *-8m > *-o, with variations,
has enjoyed a small, but steady stream of support: Hirt 1892, Agrell 1913: 47, Illic-
Svityc 1979: 108-16. Mahczak loc. cit. proposes a variant whereby *-om > *-g is
the regular development, and *-8m > *-o and *-om > *-u irregular developments.
Some scholars have also proposed that *-(j)em# (*-(j)eN#) develops to *-e, see
2.4.1 above. Why should stressed *-om simply not have developed to *-gl
64 “Strict Rule Ordering” is usually used in a synchronic sense by adherents of
generative grammar; it is sometimes very hard to separate synchronic and
diachronic arguments in discussions of this type.
65E.g., Velceva 1988: 39 simply has the -e:N from staja:N develop to -jg, with no
explanation; she proposes that mali:Ns > mol% ‘asking’ masc/neut sg sf, while ig­
noring the different development of kosti ‘bones’ acc pi (< *kasti:Ns) she (1988:
66-67) has *-i:Ns develop to *-i:N but *-u:Ns to *-u:s.
2.5.3. Irregular Sound-Change Caused by Frequency of Occurrence 49
2.5.3. Irregular Sound-Change Caused by Frequency of Occurrence
This approach is mainly associated with Mariczak, who has investigated it as
a universal phenomenon at some length, providing much of his data from
the CS1 ALG (1958, 1969, 1977, 1978, 1980 for application outside Slavic;
also quoted with approval by Schmalstieg (1983b: xii, 217-20), 1993, and
Picard 1991, 1995, 1997. It should be pointed out, however, that Manczak
denies the concept of ALG as such. In criticising the distinction between
qualitative and quantitative ALG drawn by Ltidtke 1966 (see 2.2 above), he
states (1969: 59)
“a notre avis, la notion meme de ‘Auslautgesetze’ est fausse, parce
qu’elle implique que la fin du mot presenterait des irregularites
qu’on ne trouve pas ailleurs, ce qui ne correspond pas a la realite.”
Manczak has amassed a formidable amount of evidence in support of his
framework, citing actual frequency data for various forms. He makes exten­
sive use of contracted forms such as colloquial R adpacme ‘Hi’ < 3dpae-
cmeyume, zpum ‘says’ < zoeopum to illustrate his point. He believes that
the contractions in these forms are conditioned by the frequency of their oc­
currence. He also links several instances of vowel raising to this phenome­
non, and is at pains to show that examples can be found in all positions of
the word, not just final position. According to Manczak, *-dm > *-g would
be the REGULAR development, *-om > *-o would be an IRREGULAR devel­
opment, and *-dm > *-u would be a further reduction. These would be con­
ditioned by the frequency of the respective forms where they occur, e.g., the
masc *<5-stem acc sg has the more advanced reduction *-dm > *-u because it
occurs more frequently than the neut nom/acc sg. Similarly, *-o would be
the regular development of *-os and *-u the irregular development.
There is little doubt that several forms in many languages can best be
explained in this way. Nevertheless, there is a curious contradiction here.
The contracted forms cited by Manczak in support of his proposal are taken
from the HISTORICALLY ATTESTED SI languages, whereas the CS1 ALG,
such as *-dm > *-u, if indeed they actually took place, belong to a much
earlier period. It would strengthen the case for treating *-dm > *-u as an ir­
regular sound change if similar reductions and contractions could be traced
back into Common Slavic. The forms discussed in 2.4.4 above by, e.g.,
Szemerenyi, Meillet, Vondrak loc. cit. may actually constitute examples of
such a phenomenon, if their evolution could be established more exactly.
Nevertheless, their rarity in Common Slavic is striking in this context, re­
calling the almost total lack of pre-jer fall syncope and apocope recon­
50 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
structed for Common Slavic. If *-6m > *-ii were an irregular sound change
of the type proposed by Manczak, we might expect to be able to reconstruct
more examples of syncope and apocope in Common Slavic than we can.66
It should also be noted at this stage that the cognate endings in Gothic
and Latvian show a development which finds no parallel in Slavic (see also
4.3.4), but for which at the same time Manczak uses irregular sound change
as an explanation.
2.5.4. Sandhi
Isolated troublesome phenomena in Slavic are often cited as the results of
sandhi, usually with no attempt made to link them to developments else­
where in the language (see, e.g., Zubaty 1893 (different NS1 and SSI
reflexes of IE *-ons/*-onts/*-dn in the pres act part sf); Bemeker 1904: 370
(the varying reflexes of the 3rd sg present all over Slavic); Pedersen 1905:
317 (length in the initial vowel of OCS azu T ); Otr^bski 1930a (*u/d and
*-eli alternations which might be traced back to original sandhi variants,
e.g., *-o < *-os/om\ *-e < *-oi before an initial vowel or a pause; *-u < *-os
lom\ *-i < *-oi elsewhere); Milewski 1932: 14-16, 23 fn. (differences in the
original development of CS1 long diphthongs); Georgiev 1969: 148 (-e3);
Feinberg 1978: 113, 119 fn.; Cekman 1979: 135-36; see also 2.4.5 above,
4.1.6, 4.3.5, 4.6.1, 4.6.4 below). Such thinking came in for attack from some
scholars; e.g., van Wijk 1925: 283. As with explanations using accentuation,
most of them are atomistic, and suspiciously ad hoc, invoked to explain in­
dividual forms where Slavic seems to have deviated from developments that
might have been expected based on IE reconstructions relying too heavily
on Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit. In the past the dialectal variations between
North Slavic and South Slavic in the masc/neut forms of the pres act part
have proved particularly fertile areas for such speculation (see also 6.2).67
66This point is illustrated, perhaps unintentionally, by Picard 1997. Picard argues
convincingly that the reflexes of irregular sound-changes have been integrated into
the grammar of Canadian French. These changes, however, have been accompanied
elsewhere by precisely the sorts of reductions that one might expect to reconstruct
for Common Slavic if irregular sound change played as a big a role in that stage of
Slavic as Manczak suggests. This is a topic for further research.
67Certain scholars (e.g., Gauthiot 1913: 71; Vondrak 1924: 478-81, Schmalstieg
loc. cit.) suggest that preposition + noun, or prefix + noun/verb in Common Slavic
constitute examples of sandhi; these, however, are a special case, see 6.1.5 and Orr
1987.
2.5.4. Sandhi 51
In his 1965 article, however, and in many subsequent works (e.g.,
1968a, 1968b, 1983a, 1983b: 46-48, 1983c: 184-85, passim, Schmalstieg
has developed a comprehensive theory of sandhi variants in Common
Slavic, which includes an interesting explanation for *-dm > *-u, although it
is by no means restricted to that sound-change alone. He proposes that in
Common Slavic all tautosyllabic *-aN, *-aN, *-dN, *-oN, *-uN, *-uN
merged into *-uN. He further suggests that sandhi variants of *-uN would
have developed in word-final position: before words beginning with a vowel
*-uN would have developed into *-u, and before words beginning with a
consonant into *-g. Later on, these original sandhi variants would have been
used to distinguish various morphological categories, which would other­
wise have been in danger of being lost.68 In subsequent works (1983c,
1986b) Schmalstieg has suggested that stress may also have had a role to
play, with *-u as an original unstressed reflex of *-dm and *-g as a stressed
reflex (1983c: 153, 163, loc. cit., see also 2.4.4 above).
Schmalstieg uses this hypothesis to explain problems in both nominal
and verbal morphology, e.g.,
OCS gradu ‘city’ acc sg < *-u
OCS zeng ‘woman’ acc sg < *-g
OCS nesu ‘I carried’ aorist < *-u
OCS nesg ‘I carry’ present < *-g
OCS protivu ‘against’ < *-u
OCS protivg " < *-g
prevocalic sandhi variant of *-uN
preconsonantal sandhi variant of *-uN69
prevocalic sandhi variant of *-uN
preconsonantal sandhi variant of *-uN
prevocalic sandhi variant of *-uN
preconsonantal sandhi variant of *-uN
68Schmalstieg 1973, 1974a, 1980 has made a similar proposals for PIE. His pro­
posed development of sandhi variants in Common Slavic might be seen as the repeat
of a PIE process.
69 Shevelov 1971b: 304 seems to have seriously misunderstood Schmalstieg here,
when he says:
“I cannot, however, accept the view that in Slavic the ending of the acc sg
of o-stems (r> < uN) was differentiated from the ending of the acc sg of -ci­
sterns (-o < -aN) by the generalisation of two different forms of the same
ending; one appearing before a vowel and the other before a consonant.
Why should -o-stem nouns be followed more often by words beginning in
a vowel and -d-stems by those in a consonant?”
My own understanding is that Schmalstieg is simply proposing that one sandhi
variant (*-u) chanced to become specialised as the masc acc sg ending, and the other
(*-g) chanced to become specialised as the fern acc sg ending; the development
could just as easily have gone the other way, with *-u becoming specialised as the
fern acc sg ending and *-g becoming specialised as the masc.
52 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
As can be seen from the above, Schmalstieg has amassed a considerable
body of evidence in favour of such a hypothesis. The only problem is the
question of whether sandhi should be reconstructed for Common Slavic at
all, outside the special case of preposition + noun and preposition + pronoun
combinations. Galton 1956: 175, while discussing a proposal of sandhi for
Common Slavic admittedly much less well-grounded than Schmalstieg’s
(Pedersen loc. cit., who seems to be suggesting that the initial length in OCS
(j)azu T , etc., was originally due to the generalisation of a sandhi variant,
although Pedersen himself does not mention the actual word “sandhi”),
argues quite convincingly that the well-attested tendency for Common
Slavic to develop prothetic consonants before original initial vowels (e.g., R
ebidpa < *udra ‘otter’) “ ... militates against the assumption of sandhi in Old
Slav”.
Galton also points out that in Sanskrit, where there was a comprehensive
development of sandhi (in fact, the very word is Sanskrit), all sorts of vari­
ants are attested, e.g., words such as tat ‘that’ can appear as tad or tal de­
pending on the quality of the initial consonant of the following word while
no such examples (apart from a few prepositional phrases such as, e.g., OCS
iznjego < iz + (n) + jego ‘from it’); are attested in Slavic (see also 6.1.5 and
Orr 1987).
2.5.5. Word-Final Anaptyxis
This phenomenon, which would involve suffixing a vowel to a final conso­
nant threatened by loss, was first proposed by Schleicher 1852: 143 to ex­
plain such forms as kameru ‘stone’ masc *men-stem acc sg. It never gained
much popularity (see Havranek 1926, especially 354-55; Vaillant 1950:
207-08). It was revived in an aside by Hock 1991: 162, who referred to it as
a possible explanation for the troublesome endings in OCS azu ‘I’, beretu
‘s/he takes’. Christol 1997 offers a comprehensive discussion of possible
examples of anaptyxis in IE.
2.6. Conclusion: Towards A New Proposal
In summary, it is proposed that CS1 *-dm, *-ons, *-um would all have joined
in merging in *-g, and that forms which seem to contradict this hypothesis
may be better explained morphologically.
A framework for handling the evolution of CS1 declensional forms with
no appeal to ALG would have several advantages:
2.6. Conclusion—Towards A New Proposal 53
1) All the difficulties referred to above can be side-stepped.
2) More attention would have to be paid to the relatively neglected area
of analogy and morphological factors.
3) The development of nasal vowels in Slavic could be fitted in more
easily with the typological tendencies referred to above, and therefore
there would be less need for lengthy explanations as to why Common
Slavic constitutes an exception to these tendencies. It is admittedly
true that so far such explanations have not generally been offered by
scholars in the field, perhaps this framework might preempt the need
for them.
However, it is relatively easy to simply deny the validity of ALG. What can
be offered in their place?
In the following sections specific instances where ALG are traditionally
proposed will be discussed in some detail in 4, and alternative explanations
will be offered in 5.
It should be pointed out, however, that there are also dangers in going
too far with hypothesising morphological analogical change. This point was
taken up by Meillet 1914-15: 8:
“II est etrange que, pour eviter d ’admettre des traitements
phonetiques qui ne contredisent aucun traitement connu des memes
phonemes places dans les memes conditions, on ait recouru a des
hypotheses analogiques qui sont ou arbitraires ou invraisemblables,
comme si les difficultes morphologiques etaient, par nature, chose
moins grave que les difficultes phonetiques.”70
70It should be recalled, however, as has been done above, that the CS1 ALG which
Meillet is describing as “... des traitements phonetiques qui ne contredisent aucun
traitement connu des memes conditions” actually do “contredisent des traitements
connus des memes conditions.” Furthermore, numerous quotes by eminent scholars
giving what might be described as the opposite point of view may also be noted:
Birnbaum 1975: 156 refers to: “the outmoded method of arriving at purely hy­
pothetic case form reconstructions by means of mechanistic equations ... or empty
assumptions of a “regular” ... phonetic change”; Ivanov 1985: 331 “... rules of
change in word-final position, previously cited ad hoc...”; Schmalstieg 1986b: 379:
“Special sound laws to take care of individual case endings have always had the
ring of ad hoc hypotheses...”; even Jasanoff 1983a: 141: “A sound law invented to
explain a single morpheme, unless exceptionally well-motivated on structural or
typological grounds, is always suspect”.
In any case, it may be noted that the main thrust of Meillet’s article was to
defend the reconstructions of sound changes *-6i > *-u and *-dis > *-y to explain
54 Chapter 2. Adjustments to the Standard Reconstruction
This quote is repeated twice, in different articles, by Kortlandt (1979: 259-
60 fn. 3; 1986: 184), who adds the caveat that “analogic change requires ...
the presence of a plausible motivation”. One goal in this study will be to
avoid des hypotheses analogiques qui sont ou arbitraires ou invraisem-
blables.” In subsequent chapters the morphological explanations to be pro­
posed will all be set in their proper contexts, and constantly checked against
one another, and motivations will be proposed. The above quote will also be
cited as a corrective brake on excessive enthusiasm in proposing analogical
changes.
the *<5-stem dat sg and instr pi; in the light of the quote used by Kortlandt it is
somewhat surprising to find Meillet saying elsewhere in the same article: “Sans
doute le traitement -u de *-oi est chose isolee et qui ne Concorde avec rien de connu
dans la phonetique slave” (1914-15: 4).
Chapter 3
Adjustments to the Indo-European Background:
Tendencies In Morphological Development
The reconstruction of case systems in PIE, and the various IE languages, is
one of the most-discussed problems in the whole field of historical linguis­
tics. It should be dealt with briefly here, as it will be proposed that many of
the earliest attested SI nominal endings can be reconstructed using a slightly
different IE reconstructive base than the one traditionally proposed. A brief
exposition of this system will clarify certain of the apparently more contro­
versial proposals to be advanced in this monograph, and the reconstructive
base to be used.
3.1. Indo-European Gender I: Animate/lnanimate
I follow Schmalstieg 1980: 46-87 in assuming that IE nouns passed through
a recoverable pre-inflectional stage, while differing on many of the details
of the proposed development. The earliest gender distinction that can be re­
constructed for PIE may be referred to as an anim/inanim contrast, similar to
that attested in Hittite. Krysko 1994: 198-200 suggests that this anim/
inanim contrast survived up to Common Slavic and is reflected in the simi­
lar constructions attested in the modern SI languages (see 3.2.3). Case
marking would have been minimal, with case desinences suffixed to stems
ending in vowels or consonants. The evolution of the complicated declen­
sional systems attested in Greek, Sanskrit, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Church
Slavonic, etc. would still lie some way in the future.
3.2. Indo-European Ergativity and its Possible Traces in Slavic
3.2.1. Ergativity
PIE is nowadays very often reconstructed as having passed through a stage
of being an ergative language. There is already a vast literature devoted to
the topic of ergativity, and all its ramifications. It is a very complex field,
and only a superficial treatment will be offered here. Although at first sight
this topic may seem remote from developments within Common Slavic,
relics of IE ergativity can still be seen in the reconstructed case-marking

system that will be used as a starting point in this study. At this stage, there­
fore, for the purposes of this paper we will briefly discuss one possible line
of development of ergativity from PIE to Common Slavic. “Ergativity” is
normally taken as a definition of subject/object relations, where subjects of
transitive verbs (agent) are specially marked, as opposed to subjects of in­
transitive verbs and direct objects of transitive verbs, which are usually un­
marked. This is in contrast to the systems attested in most IE languages, an­
cient and modern, which have a nominative-based system, where the direct
object of the transitive verb is overtly marked, and contrasted with the un­
marked subjects of the transitive and intransitive verb. The contrast may be
expressed through a table:
Table 3-1
n o m in a tiv e
ACCUSATIVE
AGENT
<
SUBJECT
.. (of intransitive verbs)
DIRECT OBJECT
(of intransitive verbs)
ERGATIVE
ABSOLUTIVE
For the purposes of this study, however, we will begin with the modified
definition of ergativity used by Klimov 1983: 112-13, passim, 1984. He
suggests that an important element is usually left out here: non-direct ob­
jects. In many systems traditionally considered ergative, the case called
ergative often has other functions as well, usually those of the instr, dat, or
loc. It is for these reasons that the non-agentive uses of ergativity are sub­
sumed under the deliberately vague heading of Indirect Object (Oblique
Case) below. According to this proposal, a more complete definition of
ergativity might appear as in Table 3-2 on the page opposite.
Klimov gives an example from Adyghe to illustrate this proposal:
hace-m cale-m sor rit
guest-ERG youth-ERG horse gave
‘A guest gave the horse to the youth.’

where the ending -m is the marker of both the agent (subject of the transitive

1Saxokija 1985: 131-32 points out that the dative (-s) can be used in a similar set of
meanings in Georgian, mentioning in this context the inversion construction, e.g.,
rustavels tamar mepe uqvarda
Rustaveli-D
A
T Tamar queen loved
“Rustaveli loved Queen Tamar.”
The Georgian dat, of course, can also be used to express both the indirect and
direct object in the present series, and subject in the perfect series, e.g.,
Present: Ivane megobars sacukars ugzavnis
Ivan friend-D
A
T present~D
A
T to-him-sends
“Ivan sends a present to his friend.”
Perfect: Ivanes megobarisatvis sacukari gaugzavnia
Ivan-DAT friend-G
EN
-for present-N0M to-him-sent
“Ivan has sent his friend a present.”
Saxokija also (1985: 33) gives several Old Persian examples where mana, nor­
mally described as a genitive, can also be used as a dative, to express the indirect
object, e.g.,
hauv dahyaum parsam mana frabara
he kingdom Persian to-me entrusted
“He entrusted me with the Persian kingdom.”
Klimov 1983: 127 suggests some sort of vagueness in the description of these
other uses of the ‘ergative’ case, which he has subsumed under Koceenmiu—
‘oblique’: “.. the standard form of ergativity (to which the pattern S—O—A—Oj
corresponds, where 0 | symbolises the ‘indirect’ object), ...” [emphasis mine—
RAO]. His 1984 article also seems to be implying some sort of vagueness about the
notion of ‘indirect object’: “... a syncretic ergative case ... of this kind ... clearly
exists ... single ... elements organically combine with the relations of the subject of
a transitive verb with those of the non-direct object—i.e., those relations which in
the nominative system are distributed between the instrumental and dative case.”
58 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
Trask 1979: 388, 390-95 suggests that ergative constructions may be
divided into two groups, which he labels Type A and Type B. He derives
Type A ergativity, which need not concern us further here, from a “passive
made obligatory”. Type B ergativity, however, according to Trask, arises
from “the incorporation into the inflectional paradigm of a nominalised de­
verbal form with stative force” (1979: 399). The canonical example is usu­
ally taken from the history of Persian, cf. Old Persian:
(ima tya) mana kartam
(this what) me-G
EN done
‘this is what I have done’.
By the Middle Persian period (3rd century BC-7th century AD) this con­
struction had evolved into an ordinary past tense, e.g., man kart ‘I did’.
In Type B ergative languages, the ergative construction is normally
restricted to the past (perfect), as in the Persian constructions cited above,
while the present uses a nom-acc construction. As we shall see in 3.2.2 and
3.2.3 below, proposing Type B ergativity for IE allows us to answer many
objections that have been raised to the reconstruction of ergativity for IE,
He goes on to say, however, that “ ... there are the numerous languages where the
ergative also marks the instrumental relation ... and where, in a number of in­
stances, the ergative similarly ‘combines’ the functions of some further oblique
cases, primarily the dative and locative, as well ... this combination of subject and
non-direct object functions in an ergative marker ... [emphasis mine—RAO]”.
Several scholars have also drawn attention to a possible correlation between ergativ­
ity and possession, e.g., Benveniste 1952. Seiler 1983: 40-41 and Isa£enko 1974:
62-65 have drawn attention to the fact that ‘possession’, like ‘indirect object’ and
‘implication’, is a very vague notion. Saxokija 1985: 74, in her comparison of simi­
lar constructions in Old Persian, Old Armenian, and Old Georgian, uses the R term
nocceccuenocmb to combine both ‘belonging’ (npunadneycHocmb), and
‘possession’ (UMenue, o6Aadamie, and oAadenue), and reminds the reader of this
usage further on in the book.
Klimov 1983: 108, 109 points out that fully-developed genitives and datives
only occur in nominative-accusative languages; the concepts of ergativity and pos­
session are also often linked, see, e.g., Benveniste 1952, also cited below; Seiler
1983: 54.
Schmalstieg 1980: 177-78 juxtaposes similar constructions from Latin,
Armenian, Lithuanian, North Russian, and Slovenian. Saxokija 1985: 72 gives a
table showing some of the correlations between these constructions, citing Old
Persian and Old Armenian examples.
3.2.2. IE Ergativity 59
some of them quite substantial. I would like to suggest, therefore, that IE
passed through a stage where one of its characteristics was the presence of
Type B ergativity.
3.2.2. IE Ergativity: A Brief History (The Spread of *-s)
The theory of IE ergativity may be traced back to Uhlenbeck’s influential,
albeit short, 1901 article, although Uhlenbeck himself did not use that ter­
minology. He was mainly concerned with explaining the presence of an
overt marker (*-s) in the nom sg masc, which is the starting-point for most
theories of IE ergativity, and he proposed that IE originally had two gen­
ders: animate and inanimate. Van Wijk 1902 suggested that the IE nom sg
and gen sg were originally identical (< IE *-es/os/s, with the zero-grade later
being generalised for the nom sg and the e- and o-grades being generalised
for the gen sg; the differences could be explained by citing accentuation; the
gen sg being originally stressed on the desinence).2 Later Vaillant 1936,
following Uhlenbeck, drew attention to a whole set of apparently unrelated
phenomena which could be explained by reconstructing ergativity for PIE:
the morphological anim/inanim opposition; suppletion in the pronominal
inflection; the opposition in Hittite conjugation between the -mi and -hi con­
jugations. He identified the *-s ending with an old ablative or instrumental
(1936: 94). For brief summaries of such theories, and discussions of the is­
sues involved, see Kuznecov 1961b: 15-18; Watkins 1969: 66-67; Maziulis
1970: 79-81; Bichakjian 1988: 119-27; Luraghi 1987, Matsumoto 1993.
Martinet 1962: 149-54, 1979 and Savcenko 1968 also developed theo­
ries of IE ergativity, involving the reconstruction of *-s as an old ergative
ending, with various small refinements. Marvan 1973 suggested that Balto-
Slavic (excluding Old Prussian, which he saw as having split off early from
Baltic), was archaic within IE, and that this archaism was partly manifested
in traces of the IE ergative. Schmidt 1979 evaluated and compared several
theories, suggesting that some of the points cited might lead one to the belief
that PIE was active (in the terminology of Klimov 1977) rather than ergative
in the strictest sense. The concept of an original active structure for PIE is
also used by Dobrev 1982: 90-91, 187, 189, 193-202; he attempts to com­
2Approaching the problem from a slightly different angle, Ivanov and Toporov
1961: 288 suggest that the wide variety of gen sg forms found in IE may be ex­
plained by the gen changing its relative position within the declensional system:
formerly it had been related to the “active case [ergative?—RAO]”, and that state of
affairs is reflected in the more archaic stem-forms in Baltic and Slavic. Later on, the
gen would have become more closely identified with the local cases.
60 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
bine several diverse phenomena under this heading; his proposals are inter­
esting individually, but not very convincing as a whole. Since 1980
Schmalstieg has been developing and refining a very detailed reconstruction
of IE ergativity (1980, 1985, 1986a, 1987a, 1987b, 1988, 1989), based to a
great extent on data from Lithuanian. Shields 1976, 1978, 1982a: 17-32, has
also developed a theory of IE ergativity, partly drawing on proposals made
by Schmalstieg, but introducing many of his own adjustments. With a slight
shift in viewpoint in this context, Ivanov 1985 suggested that traces of the
old IE abs (casus indefinitus) could be seen in the problematic nom sg masc
*o-stem ending -e attested in North Russian (see 4.4.2). Recently Stefariski
1990 has presented a new theory of IE ergativity, also reconstructing *-s as
an ergative ending, which, however, involves two different ergative con­
structions at different stages of IE (see also the review by Schmalstieg
1991-92).
Nevertheless, the whole theory of IE ergativity has come in for compre­
hensive criticism from, e.g., Rumsey 1987a, 1987b; Villar 1984; the latter
sees instead the development of animacy as a special category, with the nom
sg ending *-s, best attested in Hittite, appearing as a result of an original
spread of the gen ending *-s to the nom, where an original possessive form
would used as a subject (as in, e.g., Eng we’re going to John's; 1984: 185-
86). As an attested parallel to the reconstructed spread of *-m in IE as an acc
ending he cites the spread of the Spanish pronoun a in constructions with
anim direct objects, e.g.,
busco a mi amigo
I-look-for to my friend
‘I am looking for my friend’ (1984: 190-91; also cited by Martinet
1962: 153).
Many of Rumsey and Villar’s criticisms are well-taken, but with some
modifications the theory of IE ergativity can still be saved, retaining most of
the points that they would reject, while accepting their suggestions and in­
corporating them.
One of the main foundations of Rumsey and Villar’s criticisms is the
hierarchy first proposed by Silverstein 1976, which has been widely cited in
discussions of ergativity, and subsequently treated as a universal, applicable
to all ergative constructions. Briefly, Silverstein’s Hierarchy, as it has come
to be known, may be illustrated as follows:
3.2.2. IE Ersativity 61
1ST/2ND PERSON > 3RD PERSON > PROPER NOUNS > HUMAN
NOUNS > ANIMATE NOUNS > INANIMATE NOUNS.
On the basis of this hierarchy, it is predicted that in ergative languages:
“If the noun phrases of a language have accusative case-marking
or a certain plus-value of a feature [Fj], and ergative case-mark­
ing for [—
Fx], then noun-phrases are accusative for all features
above [Ft] in the hierarchy and ergative for all features below
[Fj] in the hierarchy [emphasis m ine—RAO] (Silverstein
1976).”3
Villar suggests some small modifications to the Hierarchy, and then points
out that the proposals of an IE anim/inanim distinction, with the animate
taking the *-s ending in the ergative and the inanimate a zero, conflict di­
rectly with Silverstein’s Hierarchy. Rumsey 1987b: 29 goes as far as to say
that such a reconstruction “can now be confidently rejected out of hand.”
The proposal of a framework under which PIE passed through a stage of
Type B ergativity, however, might answer several substantive objections to
the reconstruction of IE ergativity raised by Rumsey and Villar. In discus­
sions of this sort it is too often forgotten that there are numerous ergative
constructions where Silverstein’s Hierarchy does not apply; cf. Trask 1979:
388 “[In Type B ergativity—RAO] there is usually no NP split, but if there
is, IT IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH SILVERSTEIN’S HIERARCHY [emphasis
mine—RAO]”. In fact, some embryonic Type B ergative systems seem to
show the reverse of Silverstein’s Hierarchy, with first and second person
pronouns most likely to appear in the ergative, while still maintaining the
acc for dir obj, see Trask 1979: 388, 399; Orr 1989: 5-6, 13-14, 20 fn.18,
1997a.4 Type B ergativity is fairly common, it is attested as developing in
several Indie and Iranian languages, as well as Old Armenian, and an em­
bryonic stage may be glimpsed in dialects of Russian and Irish.
3Exceptions have been found to Silverstein’s Hierarchy, e.g., the various
case-marking splits in Coast Tsimshian (Mulder 1994: 149-50). Furthermore,
Trask’s suggestion that Type B ergativity is incompatible with Silverstein’s
Hierarchy needs modification. Citing evidence from Balochi, Farrell 1995: 230 sug­
gests that Silverstein’s Hierarchy may develop AFTER the emergence of Type B
ergativity. Such a development may have implications for the reconstruction of
ergativity for IE, see Orr 1997a.
4 Although Timberlake, somewhat unadventurously in my opinion, disclaims (1975:
563) that the NR agentive constructions with y are ergative, he does draw attention
to the fact that the agents in such constructions are nearly always animate.
62 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
Frequently case marking in languages with Type B ergative construc­
tions is minimal. Skalmowski 1968 gives the example of Pashto, where a
nom (abs) is opposed to an oblique, which includes ergative among its
functions, similar to the ergative system proposed by Klimov and cited
above. In many modern South Asian languages the only case distinction is
absolutive!oblique, where the ergative is one of the functions of the oblique,
e.g., Pashto absolutive sg saray/oblique sg sari ‘man’, also, e.g., mal/mh
‘companion’; mana/mane ‘apple’. In some instances the oblique sg is for­
mally identical with the pi, e.g., Pashto sari (oblique sg/absolutive pi), cf.
similar constructions in German (Bauer (nom sg)IBauern (oblique sg + rest
of paradigm)) ‘peasant’ and Romanian (prietena (nom sg)/prietene (oblique
sg + rest of paradigm)) ‘female friend’, see also Orr 1997a.
Another feature of Type B ergativity is its marginality with respect to
the rest of the syntax and morphology of the languages where it is attested:
the existence of Type B ergative constructions in any given language does
not imply anything else about the structure of that language.5 Most of
Rumsey and Villar’s substantive objections, therefore, may be answered by
proposing that IE ergativity was specifically Type B, as opposed to Type A.
To some extent echoing Uhlenbeck, loc. cit. etc., with the incorporation
of the refinements suggested above, I would like to propose, therefore, that
the *-s we find attested as a nom sg ending was originally an oblique ending,
which lost its markedness and later became a nom' marker. This would
imply that PIE passed through a stage similar to that described by
Skalmowski for Pashto.6
5 In this context I would like to respond to 6 Se 1992: 46, who, paradoxically,
seems to provide support for this view, while appearing to attack it. In a criticism of
Orr 1989, he states: “... ergativity is not otherwise a feature of Irish grammar ...”
This is precisely what we might expect for a construction such as Type B ergativity,
cf. Trask 1979: 389 “... The ergativity of Type B languages is MARGINAL
[emphasis mine—RAO]...”. Cf. also Stefariski 1990: 233, who describes similar
constructions such as those found in Old Persian, Armenian, and Lithuanian as “...
[phenomena] ... occupying marginal subsystems of these languages.”
6The agents marked by y and ag in the respective embryonically ergative con­
structions in Russian and Irish show several subject properties, see Timberlake
1975: 554-65 and Orr 1989: 9-11. In this context it is interesting to note that
Greene 1976 shows that the preposition i n- ‘in’ can also be used as a subject
marker in Irish. Saxokija 1985: 83-84 gives numerous examples of the use of
prepositions and postpositions to mark the agent in modern Iranian dialects, and
says that in Modern Persian the preposition az is used to form the logical subject.
3.2.3. The Spread of the Ending *-m 63
Shifts of oblique endings (including original ergative) into something
similar to a nominative are quite frequent, cf. Boeder 1979: 439, passim for
Kartvelian, Tiersma 1982 for a discussion of the implications for marking.
In the history of Persian mana in the original canonical example mana
kartam, originally a gen, has evolved into the ordinary word for ‘I’ in
Persian, e.g., man kart ‘I did’; man raft ham ‘I have gone’.
3.2.3. The Spread of the *-m Ending
Another ending that should be considered in this context is *-m, already
cited in the discussion of Villar's proposal. This element has an even wider
distribution than *-s: over much of IE it is present in the acc sg of nearly all
forms, except for certain neuts. For many neuts it is also present in the nom
sg. It was probably a directional affix in origin; similar to the z- in Armenian
or the -ra in Persian.
I would like to suggest, however, that in Slavic the *-m reconstructed
for the nom/acc sg neut and the acc sg of masc and fern had a more re­
stricted distribution than is commonly believed. Specifically, the *-m was
originally taken from the pronominal *<5-stems. Over most of IE it would
have FIRST appeared in the masc *(/)<5-stems, and THEN spread to the
emerging fern *(/)a-stems (see below), and subsequently to the rest of the
masc and fern declensions. In Slavic the *-m would indeed have spread to
the *(J)6- and *(/)a-stems, and then stopped there, without a further exten­
sion to other declensional classes. As we shall see, several problems in the
reconstruction of the development of CS1 nominal declension can be ex­
plained by following this proposal.
Hard evidence in support of this proposal is admittedly meagre.
Nevertheless, there are some small pieces of evidence that seem to point in
that direction.
1) The acc pi of non-neut nouns in PIE is supposed to have been formed
by the addition of *-s to the acc. sg., which would give us *-Ns in many
instances (see 3.4). For Slavic, however, this *-Ns ending can only be
reconstructed with certainty for the *jd- and *ja-stems (see below); the other
stem-classes seem to have an acc pi ending in *-Vs, where V is the relevant
stem vowel.
2) Problems arise in the reconstruction of the acc sg of the fern *n-stems
if final *-m is proposed as the acc sg ending. The acc sg of these forms is
usually reconstructed as < *-uum, which has one slight difficulty attached. It
is connected with one rather vexing problem in historical Slavic phonology:
64 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
the reflexes of the IE syllabic sonants, which, as is well-known, undergo a
two-way split in Slavic, the conditions for which are still obscure:
*/> *illul *r> *irlur *m> *lm/um *n> *tn/un
This problem should be approached with caution, as it is fraught with diffi­
culties, but there is one neglected factor, which should be considered: Iml is
a labial segment, and /«/ is also a labial segment. Why should the *m have
developed into *-lm in this environment, and not to *-um (and thence, ac­
cording to the usual reconstruction, to *-«?) It seems more likely in this in­
stance that the *-'1 does not represent a phonological reflex of *-m in this in­
stance. I would like to suggest that *-? here is simply taken from the *i-
stems, as is much of the rest of the C-stem declension in Slavic, e.g., the
penetration of the *l-stem gen sg, dat sg, and loc sg forms in *-/, the instr sg
(masc) (fem) plus numerous plural cases, see Schmalstieg
1983b: 96-102.
3) For Slavic, Baltic (especially Lithuanian), and Hittite it is possible to
reconstruct the neut nom/acc sg *o-stem ending as a bare stem, i.e., 5-0,
without the *-m which is reconstructed for all of IE mainly on the basis of
Celtic, Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit, together with slightly ambiguous
evidence from Hittite and Old Prussian. This reconstruction was first
proposed by Agrell 1926: 18, 37, and since then has won a small, but steady
stream of adherents, generating a great deal of discussion (Milewski 1931:
85 fn. 2, 1932: 17, 17 fn. 3 (with some modifications, see below); Mares
1962: 20; Maziulis 1970: 84-87; Feinberg 1978: 108; Schmalstieg 1976:
152-53, 1980: 179, 1983b: 71-72, 1992: 42; Dobrev 1982: 204; Ivanov
1985: 331; Murata 1986; somewhat more tentatively, Krysko: 1994: 159;
etc.), although some scholars, e.g., Vaillant 1958: 2: 43-44; Stang 1966:
258; Ebeling 1967: 581 fn. 19; Georgiev 1969: 37-38; Shields 1978: 193 fn.
6, 1982a: 24, Vermeer 1991: 274 fn. 5, Poljakov 1995: 197-209 argue
against or ignore such a reconstruction.7Vermeer presents the most explicit
such arguments, but surprisingly, in what is otherwise a well-researched and
convincing article, he ignores the Lith forms cited by most scholars (e.g.,
gera ‘good’ < *-5, cf. Kazlauskas 1968: 123-24, Maziulis loc. cit.; Feinberg
1978: 108, Schmalstieg loc. cit.) and the material from Bit and SI loans in
Finnic (e.g., Finnish akkuna ‘window’, presumably from CS1 *okuno, see,
e.g., Kazlauskas loc. cit., Maziulis loc. cit., 330; Murata 1986: 277-83, and
7 Some scholars, e.g., Andersen 1971: 951-52; Arumaa 1985: 131-32; Krysko
1993:119, mention the *o-0 reconstruction without taking a firm position one way
or another.
3.2.3. The Spread of the Ending *-m 65
the literature cited therein, Nikolaev & Xelimskij 1990: 418), which provide
very strong non-Slavic support, stating, astonishingly, that “this idea ... has
never been explicitly evaluated through comparison with the merits of the
traditional view”.
This *-m ending in the neut would seem to have the same function as
the *-m ending in the masc/fem acc sg, and it seemed that it was extended to
the bare stem as IE switched from ergative to nom/acc. It is generally agreed
that this *-m has the same origin across all the three genders.9 This
development may be taken as another example of an originally oblique
ending shifting to the nom.
As this *-m had a restricted range in the neut, it should be POSSIBLE
that it had a more restricted range in the masc and fern also. The Lith evi­
dence seems to point to the presence of this *-m in all forms of the
masc/fem acc sg, but the SI evidence seems to show that we can reconstruct
many of the acc sg forms (*«-stem, *I-stem, all C-stems) WITHOUT the
*-m.10
1
1Kurylowicz 1964: 210-17 suggests that in IE *-m as an ACC ending
is older than *-s as a"NOM ending in the nominal declensions, but he does
not mention the age of *-s as an OBL/GEN/ERG ending in relation to *-m.
This would mean a very ancient MORPHOLOGICAL isogloss between
Baltic and Slavic, but this should not be too surprising, considering the vast
number of PHONOLOGICAL isoglosses which separate them; in this in­
stance Slavic would preserve a more archaic form than Baltic (see also
3.7).1
1
8It should noted that Poljakov 1991: 311-12, 1995: 207-09 attacks the use of SI and
Bit loanwords in Finnic as evidence in this debate.
9 See, e.g., Uhlenbeck 1901; Lehmann 1958: 189; Kurylowicz 1964: 210-11;
Savcenko 1968: 23; Shields 1978; Stefariski 1991-92.
It should be noted that there are also some scholars who would postulate, to
various degrees, different origins for the neut nom sg *-om and the acc *-o-m, cf.
Hirt 1927: 3: 86-97.
10Szober 1927: 570 proposed a variant whereby the *-m in the neut *<5-stems was
lost within the history of Common Slavic by analogy with other endingless stems;
according to this theory the zero ending would be an innovation rather than an ar­
chaism (see also 4.3.2).
1
1 Another set of forms in Common Slavic where a variety is shown, suggesting
dialectal variations that may even be traceable back to IE are the various 3rd sg pre­
sent forms in Slavic, e.g., P prosi ‘asks’ < *-0, Ukr npocumb id < *-fi; R npocum id
< *-tu\ see Miller 1988: 20-30.

3At some stage, within the history of Common Slavic, the C-stems would have
taken the acc ending from the *f-stems (*-/ < *-7-0).
1
4In Slavic this ending appears as a gen; in Latin and Sanskrit, however, it appears
as an abl.
1
5The variety of forms in the gen sg endings seen in the attested IE languages might
be seen as the result of later, independent, albeit parallel, developments.
3.2.3. The Spread of the Ending *-m 67
4) There are some interesting forms in Hittite which hint that the use of
*-m as an acc marker may not have been universal in IE. In addition to a
possible confirmation of (c) above,16 Hittite shows an acc sg masc *<5-stem
without the *-m in certain forms, e.g.,
lahha paizzi
war-ACC s/he goes
‘he goes to war’.
See Savcenko 1968: 23-24; Luraghi 1987: 361-62, 365-67; Schmidt 1979:
341 for a cautionary note; and Shields 1982b for an alternative explanation.
The acc of direction appears in Italic, Greek, Germanic, and Slavic, so it
seems quite reasonable to reconstruct it for IE; see also Luraghi loc. cit.
5) Finally, from a different viewpoint, the proposed system, or subsys­
tem, would by no means be typologically impossible, even if statistically
rare. Let us consider some subsystems in three IE languages:
a) Faroese masc and neut (< originally Germanic *a-stems < *o-stems)
Masc Neut
Nom batur ‘boat’ horn
Acc bat horn
In this subsystem the nom is marked by the ending -ur (< Ole -r <
CGmc *-az < IE *-os), and the acc by zero (< CGmc *-am < IE *-dm). The
neut zero ending has the same origin as the masc acc. Dixon 1979: 77 fn. 23
discusses such systems, and, referring to Runic Germanic, states that such a
system is unstable. His 1994: 65-66 discussion does not expand the point.
Within Germanic, the system is attested in Gothic (masc nom sg dags acc sg
dag ‘day’ neut nom/acc sg haurn) and Icelandic (masc nom sg batur (< OIc
batr) acc sg bat\ neut nom/acc sg horn), but in both these instances one
might cite special circumstances: Gothic is now a dead language, and we do
not know how long that subsystem would have lasted—perhaps we
happened to catch Gothic right at the moment when the subsystem was
functioning, whereas another century or two either way, and we would have
missed it; in fact, later forms of Gothic do show the loss of the -s ending in
the nom sg masc, resulting in a subsystem similar to that attested in West
16 The Hittite evidence has actually come in for more substantive discussion than
the Slavic.
68 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
Germanic, see Krause 1963: 37, 44. Icelandic is a special case: it has
developed under conditions linguistically almost unique (no substratum,
very high rates of literacy). The situation within Faroese is somewhat
similar; Faroese, however, has undergone far more changes than Icelandic,
including some degree of morphological levelling and simplification
(which, in some instances, has included some restoration of the -ur ending
as a nom marker contrasted with zero as an acc marker, cf. OIc nom fugl acc
fugl ‘bird’ (in the evolution of Common Germanic to Old Icelandic, the -r
ending (< CGmc *-az) was lost in certain forms as a result of phonological
change; Faroese has restored -ur in these forms) > Far nom sgfuglur acc sg
fugl id), with periods of general illiteracy and bilingualism. This subsystem
in Faroese, however, has remained perfectly stable—it has lasted 1,000
years and shows no signs of remodelling. Therefore there is nothing
typologically impossible about proposing a similar subsystem for Slavic,
even as a partial relic of an IE ergative subsystem.1

7 Shields postulates an IE *-0 ergative ending. He (1982a: 17-19) discusses
Dixon’s proposal, and suggests that the possibility of a zero ergative cannot be ruled
out on typological grounds; typologically, a zero ergative ending is unattested.
Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that there is always the possibility that the
zero he reconstructs is the result of the loss of an overt marker; unreconstructible
with our current state of knowledge. The heterogeneity of forms found in attested IE
languages might be seen as originating in attempts to remedy such a situation.
Also, Shields, and many of his critics, seem to gloss over the possibilities in­
volved in reconstructing subsystems. Note that within IE there is a generally-
accepted, albeit problematic, example of an obi case with a zero ending: the
endingless loc.
3.2.3. The Spread of the Ending *-m 69
In sum, it is proposed that the SI *<5-stems and *d-stems passed through a
stage similar to the Lat construction in (3) above, while the other declen­
sional classes would have passed through a stage similar to the Far con­
struction in (1), with the masc and fern *<5-stems and *a-stems showing an
*-s (*-0) ~ *-m alternation in the nom/acc, and the other masc and fern stem-
classes showing an *-s (*-0) ~ *-0 alternation—a survival of the IE ergative
construction.
Furthermore, for most of IE a significant shift in marking has occurred.
The agent ergative would have been MARKED under the old scheme and the
patient abs UNMARKED (cf. Greenberg 1961: 95; Trask 1979: 385; Comrie
1981: 119-20; Rumsey 1987b: 25-26).1
8With the merging of the subject of
the intransitive verb and the agent of the transitive, the direct object, a
subset of the original abs, has become marked and the subject unmarked.
One of the manifestations of this shift in marking was the addition of a new
ending, *-m, to show the new direct object (ACC). As we have seen, how­
ever, in some dialects of IE it was extended to more classes than others; its
distribution in Slavic' may have been restricted. Therefore we might expect
that the acc in Slavic would be less marked in other IE languages, and, in
fact, some scholars (e.g., Stankiewicz 1977; Franks 1995: 53) do adduce
material suggesting that the acc is the least marked of the cases in Slavic
(see also 3.5.1, 5.2.2).
This proposal may be tied in with a feature of Slavic that has been re­
ceived comparatively little attention in this context: the rise of the anim/
inanim distinction may be partly due to the maintenance of the older anim/
inanim distinction, rather than a completely new phenomenon; see Velten
1932: 269. The proposed restricted spread of *-m in Slavic, as opposed to
Baltic, may also be seen in this light: the neut is preserved far less well in
Baltic than in Slavic. Recently Krysko 1994 has developed a new theory of
animacy in Russian, which sees the emergence of the anim/inanim distinc­
tion in Slavic as a restoration of the IE situation as described above, see also
5.4. A trace of ergative syntax may also survive in Russian in negative con­
structions, where the direct objects of transitive verbs and the subjects of
transitive verbs both appear in the genitive.
1
8 Greenberg 1961: 95 formulates the universal thus: “Where there is a case system,
the only case which ever has only zero allomorphs is the one which includes among
its meanings that of the subject of the intransitive verb.”
70 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
3.3. Indo-European Gender II: The Rise of the Feminine
As we have seen, the reconstruction of ergativity for IE has traditionally
been closely linked to proposals that the earliest PIE gender system that can
be traced is an animate/inanimate contrast, similar to that attested in Hittite;
some of the citations given above under ergativity also contain much mate­
rial on gender. Later the animate gender would have split into masc and
fern, with the inanimate gender evolving into the neut, as attested in most
modern IE systems. As also with IE ergativity, this question has a vast lit­
erature associated with it, see, e.g., Brugmann’s 1897 Princeton Lecture
(cited in Lehmann 1958: 179-80 fn. 2, 3, 4, 5; more extensively in Miranda
1975), Meillet 1921; Weinhold 1967, esp. 12-16, and the literature cited
therein, and passim; Miranda 1975; Orr 1983: 18-30; Priestly 1983; Shields
1976, 1978, 1982a: 72-81; Schmalstieg 1980: 168-88. Chronologically, the
fern gender, and the *a-stems, would have appeared AFTER the old ergative
system started shifting to a nom/acc system, with the *-s ending now spe­
cialised, unusually, but, as we have seen, not impossibly, as a nom marker in
several declensional subsystems. Roughly, although not exactly, parallel
with this change, there would have been a shift to a system of declension
classes (in the terminology used by Gladney 1983), where endings were no
longer as easily analysable into combinations of THEME VOWEL +
DESINENCE, in the sense suggested by Kuznecov 1961b: 66-67; Andersen
1971: 953, Feinberg 1978: 110, with the reflexes of such fusions developing
into distinctive endings in their own right (‘finales’ in Meillet’s terminol­
ogy), and the connections between the respective theme vowels and desin­
ences being obscured or lost altogether, cf. Meillet 1965: 385-86; Gladney
1983: 121-22. In practice this would have meant, e.g., that an ending *-us
(masc nom sg *u-stem) originally analysable as *-u- (theme vowel) + *-s
(nom sg desinence) would have developed to *-u-0 with the loss of *-s and
would have been reanalysed as *-u (masc nom sg). For more detailed
discussions of particular examples, see 5.3.8, 6.1.
The emergence of the new fern gender cannot be separated from the rise
of the *d/a-stem opposition, which underwent a great deal of development
to accommodate the new gender system.19 The *d-stem nom sg ending *-a
19 The IE declensional class which we now know as the *o-stems had already
undergone a great deal of development before the rise of the *a-stems as a separate
class, the receding of the old anim/inanim contrast, and the concurrent emergence of
the special connections between the *o-stems and *d-stems (cf. in adjectival con­
cord and the development of the original anim/inanim contrast into masc-neut/fem).
3.3. Indo-European Gender II 71
originally had COLLECTIVE meaning (some *-a forms were eventually to
evolve into neut pi forms, with subsequent generalisation of *-d as a neut
nom/acc pi ending; although still taking sg agreement in some instances),
and in some forms this meaning later shifted to INDIVIDUAL. It actually ap­
pears that one of these forms, which may be reconstructed as IE *guena (>
Gk ytivf|, OCS zena, Go qind, OIr ben ‘woman’, etc.), provided the impetus
for the formation of the new gender. Miranda 1975 provides a partial outline
of how such an evolution could have taken place, citing Brugmann 1897,
1904: 354-62, 1911: 82-109, and citing the example of a development in
Konkani as a typological parallel, where the rise of a new fem gender
(Miranda 1975: 209 fn.15 discusses the terminology for this new gender,
tentatively suggesting ‘feminine juvenile’) from the old neut can be traced
back to one form, cedii, which has undergone the semantic change ‘child’ >
‘girl’; see also Weiss 1993: 91-94 for similar data from Polish. Konkani is
an appropriate example; as Miranda shows, its gender system already has a
long evolution attested, traceable back to IE itself via Indo-Iranian and
Sanskrit.20
Once the masc/fem distinction had become established, it invaded the
*n-stems and the *I-stems, in which up to this point the primary distinction
had been non-neut/neut (anim/inanim). This process was carried further in
some languages than in others.2
1 Traces of the older anim/inanim distinction
can still be seen in the attested IE languages (cf. the adjectives: Lat facilis
‘easy’ (masc/fem)//ac//<? id (neut); Gk otbcpQoav ‘prudent’ (masc/
fem)/od)(pQOV id (neut); Skt mrduh ‘soft’ (masc/fem)/mrdu id (neut). In this
context I suggest, as a basis for reconstruction, that one tendency distin­
guishing Slavic from most other IE languages is the preservation of the
neuter as a separate category while other IE languages (Romance, Baltic,
Celtic, etc.), have tended to lose it. As we shall see, this reconstructed gen­
20One part of the proposed evolution that causes Miranda a little difficulty involves
the proposed shift from C O L L E C T IV E to IN D IV ID U A L (“Brugmann’s other ( 1 8 9 7 )
suggestion that an original collective noun ending in *-a might have undergone a
semantic change to denote a female (e.g., *ekwa ‘mare’ developing from *ekwa
‘drove of horses’) is questionable since such changes are hard to find”; 1 9 7 5 : 2 0 2
fn. 5 ). Examples of such a shift, although fairly rare, do actually exist: the Sele Fara
dialect of Carinthian Slovenian shows a form zejstu in the meaning ‘woman’ <
*zemstvo, which originally had collective meaning, cf. also Ger Frauenzimmer
‘woman’. These forms, taken together with Miranda’s Konkani evidence, show that
the entire chain of development by which IE gender is said to have evolved accord­
ing to Brugmann and Miranda is possible, even if not very common.

1No trace of any fem *n-stems can be reconstructed for Common Slavic.
72 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
der demarcation can be used to explain certain problematic phenomena (see
5.4).
Meanwhile the old ergative had split into nom and gen, distinguished
mostly by accent and/or ablaut (see van Wijk 1902) and the *-s marker had
become more productive as a gen ending than as a nom ending. At this
stage, therefore, it was NOT added to the new *<5-stems in the nom sg, only
in the gen sg.22
The evolution from a two-gender system in PIE to a three-gender sys­
tem in later IE may be illustrated in the following table:

3.4. Number in Indo-European: The Rise of *-s as a Plural Marker
There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the category of case in Indo-
European is older than the category of number, and several scholars start off
from this assumption, see, e.g., Ivanov and Toporov 1961: 289; Savcenko
1968: 24—
32; Klimov 1977: 207; Schmidt 1979: 336, 342; Schmalstieg
22Martinet 1962: 150-51 suggested that the *-5 had originally been added to the *a-
stems, but was later lost.
3.3. Indo-European Gender II 73
1980: 78-84; Dobrev 1982: 189; Shields 1982a: 63-64; 1992, i.e., nouns
acquired case-marking before number-marking. Many scholars have pro­
posed that nouns at an earlier stage of IE did not show distinctions of num­
ber, and that IE might well have passed through a stage similar to what we
actually see attested in modem Japanese, e.g.,
Nom hebi ga (a/the) snake(s)
Topical hebi wa 1
1
Acc hebi o 1
1
Gen hebino of (a/the) snake(s)
Dat hebi e to (a/the) snake(s)
Abl hebikara from (a/the) snake(s)
Instr hebi de by (a/the) snake(s)
Loc hebi ni at (a/the) snake(s)
etc., where the above paradigm is unmarked for number.23 As we shall see
below, however, number has now become definitely more ‘important’ than
case and gender in the modem IE languages.
It seems that at a later stage of its development than that discussed
above Indo-European suffixed *-s to certain forms to express distinctions of
number, see Ivanov and Toporov 1961: 289; Kuznecov 1961b: 50, 66;
Maziulis 1970: 227. In a slightly different context, Hirt 1927:3: 60 noted
that the only case in the plural where *-s was NOT attested was the genitive,
and with the interpretation of the Hittite data where *-s is attested in the
genitive plural, that statement becomes less categorical.
The development might have proceeded thus:
23This terminology is not normally used in discussions of Japanese grammar; it is
used here merely to draw attention to the proposed parallels in IE, and to provide
what seems like a fairly good typological control for the proposals being made here.
Furthermore, the Japanese particles cited here by no means correspond totally to the
IE categories of ‘accusative’, ‘dative’, etc. (especially de, to cite just one striking
example), and it should also be pointed that the ‘case-system’ postulated here is in­
complete; there are other postposed particles which can also be used to express what
might be described as ‘case’ relations, e.g., made. It should also be noted here that
the system cited is universal for Japanese nouns; there are no separate declensional
classes. Such an analysis is not, of course, meant as a new framework for Japanese
grammar; I would beg the indulgence of Japanologists at this point.

though incipient development

classes may be seen)
Within IE, this reconstructed development seems to have been partially par­
allelled in the subsequent evolution of Armenian, which has the plural
marker -k’ attached to some singular case forms and verbal forms, e.g.,
Classical Armenian:
Sg
Nom cer ‘old man’
Instr cerov "
1st pres berem ‘I bring’
As we shall see below, however, in the modern EIE languages number is
definitely more ‘central’ (using Kurylowicz’s terminology,, see 3.5 below)
than case and gender, in contrast to Japanese.
Modern Armenian, however, has remodelled its nominal declensional
system, and, similar to the development of the modern Indo-European lan­
guages, has given NUMBER a more central role: nouns are now formed
along the pattern NOUN + (PLURAL MARKER) + CASE, e.g.,2

24Turkish shows an even closer parallel, as its nouns are patterned on the frame­
work noun + (plural marker) + case, e.g.,
Sg. PI.
Abs ev ‘house’ ev-ler ‘houses’
Acc ev-i ‘ ev-ler-i- ‘
3.4. Number in Indo-European 75
Another example, outside IE, of NOUN + CASE + (PLURAL MARKER) in­
flection is provided by Mohawk, e.g.,
kanonhsdkon — kanonhso ’konhson
house-under — houses-under
From these examples it can be seen that the order NOUN + CASE +
(PLURAL MARKER) is possible as well as NOUN + (PLURAL MARKER) +
CASE.25
It is probable that at some stage PIE had a declensional system very
similar to that outlined above for Japanese. At a later stage of its develop­
ment it seems that, to express distinctions of number, IE suffixed *-5 to
forms which were already inflected for categories which might be described
as case and gender, similar to the Mohawk system.
Formation of a new plural, however, was not the only function of *-5
within the nominal system. As discussed in 3.4 and as directly evidenced by
Latin, Greek, Hittite, Baltic, Germanic and indirectly by Sanskrit and Celtic,
*-5 fulfilled a large number of functions. It seems to have been used both as
a marker of PLURALITY and as an OBLIQUE (including ERGATIVE) case-
marker in the singular.26 A glance at selected forms from Latin, Greek,
Baltic, Germanic and Sanskrit might illustrate this proposal, e.g.,
25As in the Japanese data cited above, this is not meant to suggest a new framework
for viewing the Mohawk data.
26The *-s in the nom may almost certainly be considered as originally obi for our
purposes here.
Skalmowski 1968: 110-13 gives examples from constructions in Pashto, where
nom is opposed to obi, including ergative (‘Direct’ and ‘Oblique’ in his
terminology); these might be seen as providing a typological parallel to the system
proposed here.

3.5. Drift in Slavic: Analogical Forces at Work 77
From the above patterns it may be seen that *-5 appears almost universally
in IE pi declensional endings. Although several IE families which have lost
final *-s have also shed most of their nominal inflectional systems,29 SI has
lost final *-s, while simultaneously preserving, and indeed in some cases
extending, the complicated declension system reconstructed for IE.
3.5. Drift in Slavic: Analogical Forces at Work
At first sight any attempt to try and impose some sort of pattern on the de­
velopment of declension in the history of IE languages spoken in Europe
(henceforth EIE) might seem to be doomed to failure. It might seem that all
we could do would be to say that there seems to be a general tendency
towards ‘simplification’. Even supposing that we can agree on a definition
of ‘simplification’, such a statement begs several questions: what forms and
categories might we expect to undergo simplification, and which forms
might we expect to resist simplification?30 Why does the simplification
proceed at different rates? Why, indeed, does the course of simplification
even seem to be reversed in some areas, producing systems of greater com­
plexity than those preceding them?
Inevitably, any discussion of putative common patterns in the develop­
ment of declension in the history of EIE will involve coming to grips with
the whole question of analogical change. Analogy is extremely hard to de­
fine rigorously, and repeated attempts to do so have not been crowned with
success. Its very validity has been questioned; at one extreme, Mares 1968:
37 actually suggests that there is no place for analogy in discussing the de­
velopment of CS1 declension.
In 1949 Kurylowicz attempted to establish some general principles gov­
erning analogy, whereby some sort of regularity in morphological change
could be seen, and many subsequent discussions have taken his proposals as
a starting point.3
1
In brief detail, they may be summarised as follows: bipartite morphemes
tend to replace simple morphemes; analogical changes spread from base
forms to derived forms; when new forms are created the new form corre­
29As we saw above, Armenian has also lost final *-s, but has developed a new case
system, as has Ossetian.
30Dingley 1983 cites Macaulay: “Linguists frequently study linguistic change, but
an equally interesting phenomenon is linguistic stability or resistance to change”, as
an epigraph, suggesting a further path of investigation.

sponds to the primary function and the old form to the derived function;
social factors may determine the spread of these phenomena.
Kurylowicz’s Principle No. V should be mentioned specially: “Pour
retablir une difference d’ordre central, la langue abandonne une difference
d’ordre marginal (1949: 170; 1995: 138).” Kuryfowicz gives the example of
the loss of case distinctions in Romance, accompanied by the preservation
of number distinctions.
In his numerous studies, beginning in 1958, Manczak found counter-ex­
amples for every one of Kurylowicz’s proposals; his response to Principle V
was that it begged the question: “il faut que l’auteur etablisse prealablement
la hierarchie des categories linguistiques (1958: 416).” This problem is also
referred to by Hock 1991: 228: “The only problem with this law is that it
does not tell us which distinctions are more basic than others”; 1991: 234:
“... for the fifth ‘law’ to be fully meaningful, more would have to be known
about the criteria which determine the relative basicness or centrality of
different morphological categories.” Schmalstieg 1980: 14 takes the next
logical step in this line of speculation: “One could perhaps consider the sin-
gular/plural dichotomy semantic and the case endings as syntactic markers,
although it seems quite possible to imagine languages in which relational
morphemes can be considered more important than morphemes denoting
number.” As we saw above, Japanese might serve as a very good example
of precisely such a language. Winters 1997: 379 discusses some additional
dimensions within the framework of cognitive grammar : “... what about the
relative merits of one grammatical case in relation to another? Or aspect in
relation to mood? ... a language must be examined to determine what cate­
gories are more or less central at any given moment in its history.”
Kuryfowicz and Manczak are further quoted and discussed in Vincent 1974;
Anttila 1977: 76-80; Hooper 1979; Collinge 1985: 249-53; Hock 1991:
210-37; Janda 1996: 1 fn. 1.
The study of analogy was continued by Leed 1970; Kiparsky 1974;
Vincent 1974; Anttila 1977. Schmalstieg 1980: 12-18 provides a useful
synopsis of the discussion up to that date. Even by that stage, however, one
author (Anttila 1977: 76) was suggesting that “the whole issue provokes en­
nui rather than excitement”. More recently Hock 1991: 167-279, McMahon
1994: 70-97; Winters 1995, 1997; and Janda 1996 1-7, 203-04 have ex­
tended the discussion, although some of the same basic issues remain
unresolved.

a necessity. In the same way the predicted actions of 'analogy' are not
necessities. Being obliged to deal with these two different factors, linguistics
can never predict changes to come. Alongside mutual dependence and the
hierarchy of linguistic elements within a given system, it must deal with the
historical contingence of the social structure.” This statement is amplified
and commented on by Schmalstieg 1980: 12; McMahon 1994: 76-77;
Winters 1995: 114-15, 1997: 368.
Moving briefly outside the field of linguistics to paleontology and evo­
lutionary biology, Gould 1991: 282, passim, uses the term ‘contingency’ to
describe a similar sort of process.32
Many scholars are pessimistic about our ability to formulate an all-en­
compassing theory of analogy and morphological change: Lehmann 1962:
190: “... it has become quite clear that languages are too complex to permit
32 Another, possibly more humorous, analogy, might be the hypothetical scenario of
monkeys typing out the pomplete works of Shakespeare if given enough time. This
oft-cited scenario, however, begs a question which most people discussing it seem
to have taken for granted or forgotten: there is no guarantee that the monkey(s) will
go anywhere near the typewriter(s) in the first place. Such a scenario is described by
Edmund Crispin in The Case of the Gilded Fly (118):
... “But there’s no eccentricity nowadays —none at all. Except, of
course”—he stopped and pointed—“this.”
They had reached a part of the college which Nigel remembered as a
small enclosed green. He saw that there had been erected on it a sort of en­
closed pen, inside which he could dimly discern twelve typewriters on a
table, and twelve monkeys, who sat about in attitudes of bored reverie or
copulated in an uninteresting manner. This sinister and unexpected appari­
tion took him momentarily aback. “What is it?” he asked.
“Either the Junior Common Room,” answered Fen gloomily, “or
Wilkes’ Enclosure. The latter, I suspect. Of course it’s since your time.
Wilkes, who has a very practical mind, has hired it from the college for a
very great number of years to come. But so far not a single Shakespeare
sonnet, not a line of a sonnet, not a word of a line, or even two consecutive
letters, has been produced. The monkeys have to be replaced as they die
off, of course—possibly that is prejudicial to the success of the experiment.
He sighed. “In the meantime, they show little inclination to approach the
typewriters, and content themselves with behaving in a normal, though
acutely embarrassing way.”
As Crispin points out, in the environment described, whichever law is being invoked
here predicts that the monkeys COULD produce the works of Shakespeare IF they
type for LONG ENOUGH, but NOT that they will ACTUALLY SPEND THAT TIME
TYPING, or indeed, TAKE ANYINTERESTIN THETYPEWRITERS AT ALL.
80 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
simple generalisations”; Andersen 1980: 1: “Linguists concerned with his­
torical morphology know that the various attempts that have been made to
explain morphological change by means of half-a-dozen ‘laws of analogy’
have met with very little success mainly because of the immense variety of
changes that need to be explained”. In his discussion of Kurylowicz’s
Principles, Schmalstieg 1980: 17 comments: “The attempt to develop a
priori deterministic causation is likely to be about as successful and as fruit­
ful as economic or political predictions. There may be untold factors which
escape our vision completely. We are probably about as close to understand­
ing analogy as we are to the understanding the nature of human thought and
the complete workings of the human mind. As in other historical explana­
tions we can make informed guesses, but that is about the best for the mo­
ment.” Proceeding from the abduction-based framework outlined by
Andersen 1973, Janda 1996: 2-3 points out that: “... it is easier to use anal­
ogy once it has been observed, than it is to recognize it in the first place ...
Abduction is the guess ... the weakest form of inference, for it leaves room
for error and variation.”
Most theories of analogy concentrate on morphology; Leed 1970, how­
ever, points out that PHONOLOGICAL features can also provide the impetus
for change: his example of the emergence of the alternation in Pol mnich
‘monk’—nom pi mnisi being a case in point (see also Huntley 1968 for dis­
cussion of a similar set of forms, also from Slavic). He further draws atten­
tion to the vast number of features that have to be considered, and the im­
possibility of determining whether every pertinent fact or factor has been
included. Zuravlev 1974: 33 produces evidence from CSR to show that
morphological change tends to proceed by trial and error (in the same way
as children attempt to systematise the forms that they hear into some sort of
pattern, see also Hooper 1979). He has highlighted a major aspect of the
problem, but, echoing Mariczak’s criticism of Kurylowicz, his proposal still
begs the question: how can we determine WHICH alternants will be chosen
for WHICH functions (or to preserve which functions)?
At the moment, therefore, we are still very far from answering that
question satisfactorily. A partial attempt will be made to do so below.
Most of the EIE languages can be shown to have undergone far-reach­
ing simplification in their nominal morphology, and indeed, to have even
suffered losses of number, gender, and case distinctions since their earliest
attestations. This sort of phenomenon, and related ones were grouped to­
gether by Sapir 1921: 147-92 and passim under the term drift, and the topic
has come in for a great deal of discussion since.
3.5. Drift in Slavic: Analogical Forces at Work 81
A cursory glance at EIE languages, however, shows that by no means all
categories have been lost, and that the losses have proceeded at very uneven
rates all over EIE. In some cases the process even seems to have been re­
versed. From this first glance it would seem very risky to attempt to detect a
common overall pattern to this drift, beyond a vague statement of
‘morphological simplification”. We would have to be able to subsume such
phenomena as, e.g., the loss of grammatical gender and almost total loss of
case in English under the same rubric as the preservation of these categories
over most of Slavic almost intact, in some cases increasing in complexity;
the simplification of the gender system from three genders to two (masc33'
fem) in Celtic, Romance, and Baltic, contrasted with two (common34-neut)
in Dutch and Continental Scandinavian; preservation of the original three in
Greek, German, and Insular Scandinavian, and preservation of the original
three plus increased complexity in Slavic;35 systems which include nouns
which show one gender in the sg and another in the pi. Echoing theories of
the phonological development of Common Slavic, Zuravlev 1974: 33 sug­
gests that the processes of morphological evolution may be seen as part of a
system which “... strives for stability, but never achieves it.”
One oft-cited example (Georgiev 1969: 12; Zuravlev 1974: 32, Schmal-
stieg 1980: 67) is the evolution of the *<5-stem anim pi declension from Old
Russian to CSR: every single CSR form is the result of morphological, not
phonological change, i.e.,

Acc. padbi paSoB
Gen. pa6b paSoB
Dat. paSoMb pa6aM
Instr. paSbi paGaMH

‘slaves’
It should also be pointed out, however, that certain paradigms appear to dis­
play a purely phonological evolution, cf. the evolution of the *a-stems from
33Here ‘masculine’ is the result of the loss of the neut, and the merger of former
neut forms with the masc.
34Within this sort of system ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ have merged to form a new
gender, ‘common’; this may be seen, ironically, as a reversal to the system existing
in PIE.
35 Some SI dialects show simplification, see, e.g., Priestly 1983, although others
show increasing complexity.

3.5.1. Applying Kurytowicz's Principle Five
Remaining within the broad outlines of Kurylowicz’s framework, however,
it appears that certain lines of enquiry are potentially more fruitful than oth­
ers. For our purposes his Principle No. V is still particularly promising. This
monograph will confine itself to making a proposal based on Principle No.
V, which will attempt to partially answer Mariczak’s objection, at least for
the EIE languages. Which distinctions are marginal and which distinctions
are central? As we saw in 3.4, Schmalstieg 1980: 14 states that the answers
may vary from language to language, citing hypothetical “languages in
which relational morphemes can be considered more important than mor­
phemes denoting number (see above).”
At the present all the EIE languages have preserved distinctive NUM­
BER in their nominal declensional system. As Furdal 1961: 61 fn.23 points
out, “Even languages striving for the complete elimination of inflectional
endings, e.g., Bulgarian, Macedonian, and of non-Slavic, at least English
and French, have retained special endings for differentiating singular and
plural.” There is no EIE language where the sg/pl opposition has been
completely lost, although in certain forms the distinction is lacking, e.g.,
Eng
Ger
Far
Cz
Portuguese
Fr
sheep!sheep (OE sceap/sceap)
Bogen/Bogen
ordlord
ulice/ulice
lapis/lapis
cas/cas
‘sheep’
‘curve’
‘word’/1words’ nom/acc pi
‘street’/’streets’ nom/acc pi
‘pencil’/‘pencils’
‘case’/‘cases’
3.5.1. Applying Kurylowicz's Principle Five 83
In all of the above, with English to some extent constituting an exception,36
the distinction is usually shown by
adjective, if present, e.g.,
an accompanying definite article or
Ger der Bogen/die Bogen ‘the curve7 ’the curves’
Far ordid/orditi ‘word-the’/‘words-the’ nom/acc pi
Cz dlouha ulice/dlouhe ulice Tong street’/Tong streets’ nom/acc pi
Port. o lapis/os lapis ‘the pencil’/‘the pencils’
Fr le cas/les casi7 ‘the case’/‘the cases’
In all of the above, including English, verbal concord can indicate the num-
ber when all else fails, e.g., the sheep bleats/the sheep bleat.
This proposal is further strengthened by the fact that within EIE inflec­
tional systems, distinctions of number are far more widespread than other
distinctions: they are present in most finite forms of EIE verbs and most
personal and demonstrative pronouns; languages which do not distinguish
number in the noun often can do so in the pronoun. Stankiewicz 1977: 169
proposes that: “The expression of number governs the categories of gender
and case in the sense that an increase in markedness in the expression of the
former reduces the possibility of rendering the marked categories of the lat­
ter.” This has been proposed as a linguistic universal (Greenberg 1961: 95),
and can be supported by data from several languages (e.g., IE: German;
non-IE: Tamil).
Further support for this proposal may be gleaned from the fact in child
language the CONCEPT of plurality is often grasped very early (using words
such as ‘many’), although the plural forms themselves sometimes are ac­
quired later (see, e.g., Berko 1958: 160-64, Ruke-Dravina 1959: 209,
Hooper 1979: 22; Slobin 1985: 1219; Tager-Flusberg 1989: 146^18).
Therefore I propose that in EIE the category of number is fundamen­
tal—in Kurylowicz’s words “une difference d’ordre central”. I would like to
suggest that this entails a TENDENCY (subject to exceptions, although these
are rare) to preserve the sg/pl distinction (sometimes also the du, though that
tends to be lost over most of EIE, where other distinctions are preserved, but3
6
3
7
36English still preserves vestiges of such a system with the demonstrative pronouns
this/these and that/those.
37From one point of view French might seem to constitute a more serious objection
to the theory being outlined here; the majority of French verbs (the -er conjugation)
do not distinguish 3rd sg from 3rd pi, e.g., [il don] ‘give’ (sg and pi).
It should also be noted, however, that there are other forms in French ([(lo)
zuRnal] ‘newspaper’ (sg)—[(le) zuRno]) which do distinguish sg and pi.
84 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
see Janda 1996: 175-202 for illustrations, mainly taken from Slavic, of how
original du forms have survived and taken on new functions). See also Hock
1991: 228 and McMahon 1994: 78-79, for a similar proposal restricted to
English.
The category of grammatical gender is also widespread in EIE lan­
guages. Only English and Afrikaans have actually lost it in the nominal
system, although in its final stages Polabian showed signs of the category
breaking down (see, e.g., Suprun 1987: 73) as did Manx (see, e.g., Broderick
1984: 25-27).
As we have seen above, a THREE-GENDER SYSTEM may be recon­
structed for late IE: masc/fem/neut. In the attested development of many
EIE languages, however, we can see a trend towards a two-gender system:
masc/fem, or, over part of Germanic, common/neut (a reversal to the old
anim/inanim distinction?). In other EIE languages the three-gender system is
preserved.
Examples of various possible developments are given below:
• English: loss of grammatical gender
• Dutch/Continental Scandinavian: common/neut
• German, Insular Scandinavian, Old Prussian (see also below), Greek:
masc/fem/neut
• Romance, Celtic, Lithuanian: masc/fem
• Albanian, Romanian: masc/fem (neut)38
All of the modern standard SI languages preserve the masc/fem/ neut dis­
tinction, with various elaborations.
Gender distinctions can also be found in many pronominal and some
verbal forms, e.g., R numamb ‘read’, PAST numaji ‘he read’ (masc);
numaAa ‘she read’ (fern); numaAO ‘it read’ (neut); uumaAu ‘they read’ (pi).
In some instances direct objects show agreement, e.g.,
Fr je I’ai donne (masc object)je I’ai donnee (fern object)
I it-have given
“I have given it”
This tendency may be illustrated in a table:3
8
38Italian, Albanian, and Romanian have evolved a mixed gender—masc in sg and
fern in pi, e.g., Italian filo bianco ‘white thread’ (masc sg); file bianche ‘white
threads’ (fern pi); Celtic also has a few similar forms.

It seems that here we can discern a definite trend for the languages: CASE
will be lost rather than GENDER, which will be lost rather than NUMBER.
This is by no means being proposed as a linguistic universal—many non-
EIE languages show po trace of some, or any, of these categories. Others
show them in a different order, e.g., Turkish shows NUMBER and CASE, but
no GENDER.
As we saw above, there seems to be little doubt about the primacy of
NUMBER. To establish the primacy between gender and case seems to be
much more difficult. If we confine our remarks to Slavic (although similar
examples could be cited from other EIE languages), we can see that marking
in GENDER and CASE sometimes seem to cancel each other out. Although
the nom is usually cited as the maximally unmarked case, it might be
pointed out that several scholars have suggested that in Slavic this slot might
rather be filled by the acc; Stankiewicz 1977: 170 argues that the acc is the
maximally unmarked case in that it distinguishes four genders —masc
inanim/masc anim/fem/neut—CASE is subordinated to GENDER. Citing
similar data from CSR, as well as from Polish and Serbo-Croatian, and
working within a Government and Binding framework, Franks 1995: 41-55
also suggests that the acc is maximally unmarked (see also 5.2.2).3

40 As we
39 The possessive ’s in English may at first sight seem to constitute a counter­
example to this generalisation, as an apparent case-ending; however, it is separable,
e.g., the King of Sweden's hat', the man I work with's wife \ and therefore cannot be
considered a true case-ending
40This proposal might provide part of an answer to Velceva 1988: 39, who suggests
that forms such as OCS dusi ‘spirit, soul’ dat/loc sg, zemlji ‘land’ dat/loc sg < *-jej
< *-jaj show that *-a- was fronted after /j/ (see 2.1.8 above). Unlike the fern *a-
stem acc sg (see 5.2.2), these forms would probably not have escaped the shortening
86 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
shall see, however, there are examples where GENDER is subordinated to
CASE. Such examples can easily be multiplied, and reveal a complex maze
of interlocking hierarchies. Nor should purely historical factors be forgot­
ten—sometimes one might even say that inertia plays a role.
However, if we express the proposal more exactly, we can still extract a
fruitful generalisation: ALL CASE DISTINCTIONS WILL BE LOST BEFORE
ALL GENDER DISTINCTIONS. This formulation would cover several prob­
lems, e.g., the loss of the neut in Lithuanian and Latvian as against the re­
tention of the case system, a similar phenomenon in Goidelic, etc.
Again, partial support for this proposal may be gleaned from child lan­
guage. Although the evidence is somewhat contradictory here, children
mastering a first language generally tend to master gender agreement before
case (Ruke-Dravina 1959: 214). It should be pointed out, however, that the
order of acquisition may vary from language to language: Smoczynska
1985: 645^-6; Slobin 1985: 1216-17 show that gender is acquired before
case in Polish, whereas in Russian it is appears to be the reverse.
In this instance Polish would appear to approximate the CS1 situation
closer than Russian. Russian has undergone large-scale vowel reduction and
merger in final syllables, resulting in a system where large numbers of neuts
and ferns both end in [-a], rendering gender distinctions opaque (which has
resulted in the loss of the neut in some R dialects). Polish, however, has not
undergone such changes, and gender distinctions are much more salient, and
consequently acquired earlier (Smoczynska, Slobin, loc. cit.). It is almost
certain that Common Slavic would not have undergone such changes either,
and therefore it does not seem too great a leap to suggest that gender would
have been acquired before case in Common Slavic.
There are however, other instances where this framework breaks down.
In many of the modern Slavic languages the dat, instr, and loc pi forms re­
tain their distinctive number and case, but have lost their distinctive gender,
as shown in Table 3-7 on the page opposite.
However, this would seem to fit in very well with Stankiewicz’s (1977:
169) proposal that marking in number overrides marking in gender and case.
of long diphthongs, as there would have been no need to distinguish masc, neut, or
fem in the loc (dat) sg, as opposed to the acc sg; therefore they may simply be
reconstructed as < *-jei < *-joi < *-joi (*-jai), rather than the process outlined by
Velceva.

Serbo-Croatian has arranged the distinctions in these forms differently: here
gender does seem to be more important than case, e.g.,

At this stage we should examine these categories more closely: WHICH
gender(s) and WHICH case(s) can we expect be preserved? And which
mergers can we expect?
Throughout much of EIE the tendency seems to be to reduce the origi­
nal three gender system to a two-gender system. Outside Slavic, Old
Prussian, Greek, German, and Insular Scandinavian have preserved the
three-gender system down to the present.
Slavic, however, has not only maintained the three-gender system in­
herited from IE, but has extended it by adding the categories of ANIMATE,
and, in some cases, PERSONAL. These are mostly further developments of
the masc. In fact, many of the morphological restructurings to be proposed
below can be seen as part of the drive to preserve gender distinctions in
Slavic, especially the neut. Something similar was proposed by Jagic 1906:
118: “... hatte das Slavische ebenso wie das Litauische nach dem laut-
gesetzlichen Vorgange das Neutrum verloren, wenn sich nicht die kategorie
des genus widersetzt und als machtiger erwiesen hatte.”4
1
41 Certain authors (Meillet 1965: 457-58; Szober 1927: 567; Zuravlev 1974: 41) see
gender as of lesser importance in Slavic, citing such factors as, e.g., the neutrali-
88 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
For the purpose of this monograph, therefore, I would like to extend
Stankiewicz’s proposal with regard to marking in number overriding gender
and case and suggest that, on balance, marking in gender overrides marking
in case, although some counter-examples may be cited.
As we shall see, and discuss in further detail below (5.4), within the
processes of analogical change the neut will preserve the old ending while
the masc will innovate. This can be shown to be a common thread running
through at least three developments in Common Slavic: (1) The nom/acc sg
of the neut *o-stems vs. the nom sg of the masc *o-stems; (2) The nom/acc
pi of the neut *o-stems vs. the nom pi of the masc *d-stems, and (3) the
nom/acc sg of the neut *men-stems vs. the nom sg of the masc *men-stems.
3.6. Syncretism
At this stage a more rigorous definition of syncretism will be attempted, as
in EIE this phenomenon is far more likely to occur in case than in number or
gender.42
Turning now to case, the most likely mergers in Slavic can be observed
by citing the du, which has a maximum of only three distinctive forms (see
also Mares 1962: 11):
sation of gender distinctions in the pi. Such phenomena may be seen as the earliest
manifestation of a tendency, still quite weak within most of Slavic, but completed
over wide areas of the rest of IE, to reduce the three inherited genders to two.
Perhaps the process through a period described loosely as “Early Common Slavic-
Common Slavic-disintegrating Common Slavic-the emergence of the individual
Slavic languages” might be described as the peak of the rise and fall of gender in
Common Slavic.
42Syncretism is a vast topic, and much of the material remains obscure.
Coats 1973: 71, operating within a generative framework, provides the follow­
ing definition of syncretism:
“...the occurrence of phonologically identical endings in different
inflectional forms that share at least two of the syntactic or morphological
features that are relevant in the inflectional system.”
Carstairs 1987: 115-16 defines syncretism thus:
“A systematic inflexional homonymy is a SYNCRETISM if:
a) the homonymous forms are simultaneous exponents of more than
one morphosyntactic property, and
b) the conditions under which the homonymy occurs (or: the context
for the homonymy) can be stated entirely in terms of the properties thus
realised.
For a brief discussion and a useful bibliography, see Meiser 1992.
nom-acc (voc)
gen-loc
dat-instr
3.6. Syncretism 89
Jakobson 1932, 1958, attempted to find invariant meanings for the cases
in CSR, using a system of distinctive features. Georgiev 1969: 22 proposes a
system, which he means only to apply to the prehistoric period of Slavic,
whereby one can predict which cases will not fall together, based chiefly on
data from the historical evolution of the attested Slavic languages:
acc cannot merge with dat
gen cannot merge with nom
dat cannot merge with nom, acc
instr cannot merge with dat, loc
loc cannot merge with nom, instr
For criticism of Georgiev’s framework, see Andersen 1971: 952.
While mainly discussing CSR, Chvany 1982: 142 presents evidence to
show that the instr had the potential to become somewhat isolated from the
rest of the paradigm.
All that can be said at this stage is that the reconstruction of morpholog­
ical changes involving the preservation of case distinctions is much less
straightforward than ones involving the preservation of those of number or
gender, and related proposals below will be more tentative.
One other type of syncretism that should be discussed is CROSS­
NUMBER syncretism. One very common example is NOM PL/GEN SG
(NOM here often also includes ACC, or may in some instances be replaced
by ACC), e.g.,
Lat gen sg/nom pi d o m in l ‘master(s)’
OIr gen sg/nom pi c la (i)d ib ‘sword(s)’
Gk gen sg/acc pi XOVQO.C, ‘girl(s)’
Go gen sg/nom/acc pi g ib o s ‘gift(s)’
Latvian gen sg/nom/acc pi m a sa s ‘sack(s)’
In CSR, however, we have a large number of apparent counter-examples,
from various declensional classes, where the two forms are distinguished by
stress, e.g.,
peKH (g en sg)/peK H (n o m pi) ‘riv e r(s )’
cjiobo (g en sg)/cjioB a (n o m pi) ‘w o rd (s )’
o k ho (g en sg)/oK H a (n o m pi) ‘w in d o w (s)’
p o r a (g en s g ) /p o ra (n o m pi) ‘h o m (s )’.
90 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
Jakobson 1957 and Hamm 1966: 41 propose that such suprasegmental dif­
ferences might have used to distinguish the two endings. While not denying
the possibility that suprasegmentals could have been utilised to make such
distinctions (analogous to the reconstructed split of the old IE ergative into
nom and gen proposed by van Wijk 1902), it must be stated that such an as­
sumption is unnecessary. In any case, some of these examples are the result
of more recent developments, specific to Russian. Furthermore, the Latin,
Gothic and Old Irish examples above would probably all have had fixed
stress,43 thus offering a further set of excellent examples of such a syn­
cretism. In the modern Slavic languages we can also find examples such as
Cz hlavy ‘head’, divadla ‘theatre’; Pol glowy ‘head’, okna ‘window’; SC
zene ‘woman’ sela ‘village’. CSR itself can show such examples as Kocmu
‘bones’, although these are not as common as in other Slavic languages.
Such syncretisms, in fact, can be traced back to CS1 accent paradigms a and
b, see, e.g., Stang 1957: 56-61, 82-83; Garde 1976: 1: 22-23; Dybo 1981:
18-19; Carlton 1991: 189.44
Therefore I would like to propose that for all EIE languages NUMBER >
GENDER > CASE, according to Kurylowicz’s Principle No. V, and to apply
this framework to the reconstruction of extensive changes in the Slavic
nominal declension, triggered by the far-reaching phonetic and phonological
change which took place. The framework predicts that within these far-
reaching changes priority will be given to the rescuing of NUMBER distinc­
tions threatened with loss, followed by the rescuing of GENDER distinctions
(especially the maintenance of the neut in the nom-acc sg and pi) and then
CASE distinctions.
This approach is in contrast to many of the previous approaches; many
scholars who make proposals regarding the development of Slavic declen­
sion based on analogy concentrate on the drive to save distinctions of gender
and case, important, to be sure, but not as fundamental as number, cf.,
Fortunatov 1897: 164 fn.l; Ferrell 1965: 104, passim; Zuravlev 1974: 31-
32, 36; Feinberg 1978: 113, although the latter does hint at the importance
of number further on in the same article (1978: 115).
As we shall see below, however, this framework can be made to fit in
very well with the developments that may be reconstructed in the evolution
43 See d’Alquen 1988: 184-87 for the evolution of the suprasegmentals in the Go
forms.
44 Coats 1973: 72, however, suggests that “ ... not all phonological endings are
syncretic.” All of the examples that he cites, however, might be cited as examples of
the very cross-number syncretism being discussed here.

Although at first sight Baltic appears far more ‘archaic’ than Slavic; in
fact, certain scholars have even advocated using Baltic, especially
Lithuanian, data as a check on CS1 reconstructions (see especially
Otkupscikov 1974, 1983, Jasanoff 1983a: 142, although for criticism of this
view see, e.g., Stankiewicz 1988), this generalisation needs some clarifying
in at least two respects.
3.7.1. Defining "Archaic"
In historical linguistics (and probably in other related fields)45 the terms
‘more archaic’ and ‘less archaic’ need some quantifying. To take one fairly
obvious, albeit extreme, example, probably no scholars would rate English
as ‘more archaic’ than German overall, and yet for certain features, in
phonology, morphology, and syntax, this is an fair statement, e.g.,
1) The preservation of Gmc jb in English as opposed to its loss in
German, e.g., Eng three—Ger drei < CGmc *prij-.
2) The related preservation of unshifted Gmc t, d in English as opposed
to their development to c (orthographic z), t under the Second Sound
Shift in German, e.g., Eng ten—Ger zehn (< CGmc *teyun).
3) The preservation of IE w in English as opposed to its development to
v in German, e.g., Eng win—Ger (ge)winnen [(ge)vinon],
4) The preservation of a three-fold alternation in certain Gmc Class I
strong verb paradigms, e.g., Eng drive (< IE *-ei-)—drove (< IE
*-oi-)—driven (< IE *-/-), as opposed to Ger treiben (< IE *-ei-) —
trieb—getrieben (the generalisation of the reflex of CGmc *-t-) 46
5) The failure of English to develop HAVE-constructions such as Ger
Ich habe Hunger ‘I have hunger’ “I am hungry”.
45Again citing a parallel from evolutionary biology, Desmond 1977: 210 asks: “...
but what does it MEAN that one group of animals [or language; emphasis mine —
RAO] is older than another?”
46This one is arguable; the Eng form drove has been extended from the sg to the pi
(< OE drafldrifori). In any case, there is a vast number of strong verb forms where
German is obviously more archaic than English. The point is, however, that this
greater degree of archaism is not 100%.
92 Chapter 3. Adjustments to the Indo-European Background
6) The preservation of 1st sg am in English as opposed to its loss in
German.
7) The preservation of certain lexical items from Common Germanic
(and IE) in English as opposed to their loss in German, e.g., Eng tree,
choose, ask.
Of course, it would be very easy to think of far more examples where
German preserves archaisms where English has innovated, especially when
dialectal materials are considered; the point here is that ‘more archaic’ and
‘less archaic’ are relative terms, to be used with a degree of caution. Within
Slavic, Russian may be seen as ‘more archaic’ than Polish with regard to
certain syntactic constructions and lexical items (Orr 1992), whereas from
the point of view of the evolution of gender Polish may be said to be more
archaic in some respects than Russian (cf. Slobin 1985: 1194, 1216; Weiss
1993: 99-101). Manczak 1991: 74-76 makes a similar proposal regarding
the oft-cited status of Sardinian as the most archaic Rmc language. This per­
ception of Sardinian is based on the fact that it preserves the original Italian
velars before front vowels; Manczak, however, shows that from the point of
view of the lexicon, standard Italian is actually more archaic than Sardinian.
3.7.2. Defining "Baltic"
‘Common Slavic’, ‘West Baltic’, and ‘East Baltic’ are.relatively straightfor­
ward concepts; ‘Balto-Slavic’ is much less so; but the problems in recon­
structing ‘Common Baltic’ are immense. In fact, it has even been suggested
that Slavic is originally a type of ‘West Baltic’ (Zeps 1984), cf. also Ivanov
andToporov 1961;Toporov 1988.
At this stage it might be advisable to summarise the points where Slavic
may be said to be ‘more archaic’ than Baltic in the nominal declension.47 In
most of them it will be noted that Slavic disagrees with only a part of Baltic
in many forms. Some will necessarily be contentious, cf. especially (6), (7),
(8).
47In the Introduction it was stated that in some respects Slavic was more archaic
than Baltic. It might be noted that there are instances where Slavic is more ‘archaic’
than Baltic even in the development of the phonology; e.g., Slavic has kept the re­
flexes of IE *k separate from those of the ruki formula, cf., whereas Lithuanian has
merged them.
3.7.2. Defining "Baltic1 93
1) The preservation of the neut in Slavic as opposed to its loss over most
of Baltic; in this context it is startling, that Lithuanian, which is usu­
ally taken as the most ‘archaic’ form of Baltic, has almost completely
lost the neut, while Old Prussian has preserved it (but see Schmalstieg
1992).
2) The related restoration of the IE anim/inanim distinction (see 3.2.3,
and Krysko 1994: 198).
3) The preservation of a neut *s-stem paradigm in Slavic as opposed to
its near-loss in Baltic, e.g., OCS slovo ‘word’—gen sg slovese,48
4) The preservation of a *u-stem paradigm in Slavic as opposed to its
loss in Baltic, e.g., OCS svekry ‘mother-in-law’- gen sg svekruve;
5) The more recent survival of length in the nom sg form of the fern Ea­
sterns in Slavic than in Baltic, cf. OCS rqka ‘hand’< *ranka\ Lith
ranka ‘hand’ < *ranka would have developed into *ranko without
shortening, and we might refer to the fern *o-stems in Lithuanian, as
in Germanic.49. It should be noted, however, that here Old Prussian
agrees with Slavic against East Baltic, cf. Lith galva ‘head’; Latvian
galva id < *-a as opposed to OPr galva id; OCS glava id < *-d;
6) The failure of Slavic to develop the postposition *-en as an affix, cf.
OCS synuxu; Lith sunuose ‘son’ loc pi, Old Lith -su.
7) The development of a gen pi form in Baltic which may reflect *-dm as
opposed to the lack of any such form in Slavic.
8) The greater extension of *-m as an acc marker in Baltic than in Slavic.
9) Finally, one might also cite the fact that while extra cases have
emerged in both Baltic and Slavic, Lithuanian might be said to have
carried this development further, see Stang 1966: 228-32, e.g., galva
‘head’; acc sg galvq, illative sg galvon, gen sg galvds, allative sg
galvdsp, loc sg galvoje adessive sg galvaip\ within Slavic, Russian
might be said to have developed new cases in the Gen-2 and Loc-2,
cf. Jakobson 1932, 1958. In any event, this point only serves to high­
light the difficulty of categorising whole groups of languages as ‘more
or less archaic’; one part of Baltic (Latvian) may have lost cases (or
failed to develop extra ones).
48Cf. the unique form Lith menuo ‘month’—gen sg menese.
49Leskien 1919: 137-38; this phenomenon is also referred to as ‘Leskien’s Law’,
see Arumaa 1964: 194; Collinge 1985: 115-16.
Chapter 4
Some Proposals So Far: Some Passages from the Pages
of the History of the Reconstruction of Common Slavic
Nominal Morphology
Most of the SI declensional forms explained using ALG have been the sub­
ject of a vast literature, which is still being augmented, without, one feels,
actually coming any closer to a solution. This chapter will include brief dis­
cussions of some of the more problematic forms, and selected previous pro­
posals, without, however, offering solutions as such —those will be left to
chapters 5 and 6. The extent of the literature makes mere selection a major
problem. Some schplars have formulated their proposals as responses to
other proposals; these will be included under the heading of the respective
author to whom they are responding. Certain other authors discuss the
problems and the pros and cons of differing solutions without making any
concrete proposals of their own; these will not be allotted special sections in
the discussions below (cf. Mikkola 1942: 186-87; Kuznecov 1953: 42-43,
1961b: 51, 57, 63, 78-80; Shevelov 1964: 156-57, Arumaa 1985: 130-32).
As this chapter will be discussing previous theories, the problematic
endings will be grouped according to traditional criteria, e.g., the masc nom
and acc sg of the *o-stems will be discussed together here, although it will
be argued elsewhere in this monograph that the masc nom sg should prop­
erly be grouped with the neut nom/acc sg and the masc acc sg with the fern
acc sg. Very few authorities have followed this approach (e.g., Shevelov
1964: 62, 157, 225, 332, hints at it; Schmalstieg 1965, passim, makes it an
integral part of his theory).
Certain other problems, such as, e.g., the gen pi ending, or the masc
nom sg ending of the pres act part, will be discussed in 6, as they are not
directly relevant to the overall morphological reconstruction being proposed
here, although they provide apparent support for the SI ALG.
96 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
4.1. The Masculine Nominative and Accusative Singular and Neuter
Nominative and Accusative Singular of the *o-Stems:
Phonetic/Phonological Approaches
This issue is one of the most difficult in the whole of SI studies, and will
take up proportionately the most space in this chapter; there already exists a
vast literature, probably even including enough material for a graduate sem­
inar.
On the surface, however, the questions to be answered seem extremely
simple:
a) Is the masc nom sg *(5-stem ending *-ii to be derived directly from IE
*-os, without reconstructing any analogical changes?
b) Is the acc sg ending, also *-w, to be directly derived from IE *-dml
c) Whatever the answers to (a) and (b), where does the neut nom/acc sg
ending *-o fit in?'
There is also a problem of SI dialectology: where does the NR nom sg masc
*o-stem ending -e fit in—is it the result of a purely phonological/phonetic
change, or were there morphological/analogical factors at work as well?
These questions have been generating vast amounts of discussion for
over a century and a half. As Vermeer 1991: 273 fn. 4 points out, a
“comprehensive treatment of existing solutions to tjie problem of the re­
flexes of Proto-Indo-European *-os and *-dm in Slavic would require a
book.” An attempt has been made here to focus on differing approaches to
the problem; it is astonishing how many proposals can be formulated to
cover what, on the surface, is a fairly straightforward question.
A negative answer to (a) is normally accepted, but the varying proposals
over the last century should be evaluated. I would like to suggest that (b)
should also be answered in the negative, although it is normally accepted
without question.
4.1.1. Fortunatov and Leskien
As we saw above (2.2, 2.3), the approach to the CS1 ALG as a special sub­
ject of study is one of the most long-standing problems in the history of the
study of Slavic linguistics. Schleicher 1852: 39, 143, 222, 224; 1876: 127—
29, 298-3001
2 was already referring to the simple dropping of final *-m
1One could, of course, reverse the order of these questions and start with the neut.
2“Schleicher 1876” refers to the third edition, published posthumously, of
Schleicher’s Compendium der Vergleichenden Grammatik der Indogermanischen
4.1.1. Fortunatov and Leskien 97
(*-« ) (cf. OCS vluku ‘wolf’ acc sg < *vlaka-m (*vlaka-n) and of *-s (cf.
OCS vluku id < *vlaka-s), as was Miklosic 1879: 297-302. These scholars
still adhered to the earlier reconstruction of IE vocalism discussed in 2.1.2
above.
Modem scholarship on the subject can be traced back to Fortunatov and
Leskien. It is by juxtaposing their views that a problem was seen; previous
scholars did not seem to believe that any problems arose. The debate is often
formulated in terms of a contrast between Fortunatov and Leskien’s
proposals, cf. Ljapunov 1905: 4-6; Hujer 1910: 13-17, 1920: 26-30; Agrell
1913: 47—
49; Schelesniker 1964: 53; Ferrell 1965: 93—
106; Ivsic 1970: 184—
85; Feinberg 1978: 107;3Vermeer 1991: 273-85, 1994: 147, 149.4
Fortunatov and Leskien both tried to include all the relevant forms in
their expositions. While accepting the sound-change *-dm > *-w, Leskien
1876: 3-5,5 1907 argued that the direct phonological reflex of *-os was *-o,
Sprachen. A comprehensive history of changing views of the CS1 ALG in the de­
velopment of scholarship has yet to be written.
It might also be noted that Schleicher also cited ALG for Gothic and
Lithuanian.
3Feinberg does not actually mention Fortunatov and Leskien by name in this con­
text.
4Formally, Leskien’s proposals date from 20 years before Fortunatov’s. The actual
publication of Hirt’s contribution, to be discussed in 4.1.2, actually predates
Fortunatov’s, but according to Ljapunov 1905: 5, Fortunatov had already been ex­
pounding his theory for many years before publishing it in German and Russian.
Vermeer 1991: 273-82 includes a useful history of the question of *-os > *-u,
citing a wide range of the relevant literature. He suggests that *-os > *-u was only
really accepted as a viable reconstruction between 1893 and 1910.
One statement of Vermeer’s (1991: 279), however, requires some qualification:
as far as investigators actively interested in the phonological history of Proto-
Slavic are concerned, the Fortunatov hypothesis [the putative ALG *-os > *-u—
RAO] has been dead for more than three quarters of a century”. Actually, it has
shown far more staying power in the scholarship than Vermeer seems prepared to
admit, especially if one takes into consideration theories that involve *-os and *-dm
both developing to *-u under certain circumstances; cf. Agrell 1913: 47, passim,
Meillet 1914-15, 1916, 1922, 1965: 404-05; Otr^bski 1930a; Milewski 1932: 17;
Vaillant 1958: 29; Kuznecov 1961b: 51, 57, 63-64; Ferrell 1965: 97; Arumaa 1985:
130; Velceva, 1988: 38, 59-67; Zaliznjak (Nikolaev, Dybo) 1988: 170, etc. In any
case, his demarcation between “specialists” and “non-specialists” seems a little bit
artificial; his criteria are not immediately clear.
5Leskien 1876 adhered to the tripartite reconstruction of IE vocalism based on
Sanskrit, as did Bopp, Schleicher, Miklosid, and Miillenhoff, but by 1907, of course,
he had switched to the Greek-based five-vowel system.
98 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
and that the *
*-« ending in the masc was the result of an analogical process,
whereby the ace sg ending *-« (< *-om ) was transferred to the nom sg by
analogy with several other CS1 patterns, especially the *«-stems. He ex­
plained the *-o in the neut as a borrowing from the *-s-stems, e.g., slovo
‘word’< *kleuos, a clear example of *-os > *-o,. and therefore one of the
best pieces of evidence against *-os > *-u.6
Miillenhoff 1878, who adhered to the earlier reconstruction of IE vocal­
ism, with original *-a- splitting into *-d- and *-e-, offered a variant. While
basically agreeing with Leskien on the sound-change *-os > *-o, he sug­
gested (1878: 434-35) that *-om > *-u passed through a stage *-d (a short
nasal in his notation). He may have been the first to propose that short nasal
vowels simply denasalised, whereas long nasal vowels kept their nasality.
Fortunatov (1897: 164 fn. 1, 1957: II: 182-85), however, argued that the
direct phonological reflex of *-os was *-u, citing the apparent parallel with
Latin discussed in 2.3.1, 2.4.4 above, where the development -os > -us and
-om > -um is actually attested. In support of this theory he cited the dat pi
ending -mu < *-mos, the 1st pi ending -mu, and the isolated prepositional
form otu ‘from’, which he related to Skt atah ‘thence’. The latter compari­
son was disputed by several scholars (e.g., Hujer 1910: 18-25, 1920: 27,
Ferrell 1965: 99). Fortunatov explained the neut ending by hypothesising a
transfer from the pronominal form *to < *tod ‘that’ (the *-d would have
been lost in the Balto-Slavic period, before *-o- > *-u- in a final closed syl­
lable, see 2.1.4, 2.4.7, and 4.1.1 above). Several scholars have accepted the
proposal, with various modifications, that the neut form has this origin;
Vondrak 1898: 335, 1924: 107; Ljapunov 1905: 6; Brugmann 1904: 376
fn.l; Mikkola 1942: 186; Seliscev 1952: 90; Koschmieder 1956: 239-10;
One part of his proposal that was later dropped from the discussion was that the
*jo-stem masc nom/acc sg *-< was taken from the *;-stems; see Mikkola 1942: 186,
Ferrell 1965: 93-94.
6 Ferrell 1965: 100 dismisses the idea that the *s-stems could have had any influ­
ence on the developments (“Leskien’s attempt to reverse the identification pro­
cess—his setting up -o as the phonological reflex of *-os and his adducing morpho­
logical pressure from the slovo type as one of the factors in the replacement of the
phonological -t>reflex of Proto-Slavic *-on < Indo-European *-om by -o (phono­
logical *del~b by delo) —is linguistically well-nigh incredible”), but, e.g., Bernstejn
1974: 162-63 offers a fair bit of evidence to show that the *.v-stems did undergo
bursts of productivity in certain areas of Slavic. While not wishing to repeat the
whole of Leskien’s 1876 solution, one might see the *s-stems as exerting a
supporting influence on the choice of *-o as the neut nom/acc sg *(5-stem ending (cf.
also Agrell 1913: 93-94; Arumaa 1985: 131-32).
4.1.2. Hirt 99
Vaillant 1958: 43-44; Kuznecov 1953: 68, 1961b: 51; Kortlandt 1979: 262;
Lunt 1981: 17; Velceva 1988: 87 fn.; Vermeer 1991: 284 although others
have expressed concern (Nandri§ 1969: 76, who cites Agrell 1926; Szober
1927: 565-66; Maziulis 1970: 85-87).
4.1.2. Hirt
Meanwhile, partly as a response to proposals on accentuation put forward by
Streitberg 1892, to whom he refers elsewhere throughout the article, Hirt
1892: 348-49 proposed that accentuation had played a vital role in the de­
velopment of these endings, see also Hirt 1904-05: 291-92, 1929: 176-78,
and 4.7.1 below. Adducing evidence from Lith accentuation, he suggested
the following hypothesis:
a) stressed *-os/*-om> *-o
b) unstressed *-os/*-om> *-u
He pointed out that many nouns which appear as neut *8- stems elsewhere in
Indo-European turn up as masc *o-stems in Slavic, e.g., OCS dvoru ‘yard’,
cognate with Lat forum id, Skt dvaram ‘door’. He went on to propose that
only IE OXYTONE (stem-stressed; CS1 accent paradigm B) neuts survived as
neut *<5-stems in Slavic, while IE BARYTONE (root-stressed; CS1 accent
paradigm A) neuts were transferred to the masc *o-stems. He claimed
(1892: 360) that this theory would explain six problematic forms:
a) the masc *o-stem nom sg:
b) the masc *<5-stem acc sg:
c) the masc *jd-stem nom/acc sg:
d) the neut *8/jo —stem nom/acc sg:
e) the *81jo —stem gen pi:
f) the form bratu (bratru):
rabu < CS1 *orbos ‘slave’
rabu < CS1 *8rbon "
konfi < CS1 *k8njos ‘horse’
konfi < CS1 *konjon "
zruno < CS1 *zim8n ‘grain’
pifije < CS1 *pifijen ‘drink’
rabu <CS1 *8rbdn ‘slaves’
konfi < CS1 *konjon ‘horses’
zrunu < CS1 *zirndn ‘grains’
bratu < CS1 *brat8r ‘brother’
In his 1892 article (1892: 349) Hirt cites three *<5-stem forms which are
masc in Slavic, but neut in other IE languages: OCS dvoru ‘yard’ (cf. Skt
dvaram ‘door’), OCS miixu (cf. OHG mos ‘moss’), OCS dolu ‘hole’ (cf. Go
dal ‘valley’) and three possible IE *s-stems which have become masc *o-
stems in all or part of Slavic: OCS jadu ‘poison’ (cf. Gkolbog ‘tumour’),
OCS udu ‘body part’ (cf. udesinu ‘body part’ adj), OCS vidu ‘appearance’
100 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
(cf. Gk eiSoi; ‘appearance’). Later (1929: 177) he increased the number of
examples to six, adding OCS daru ‘gift’ (cf. Gk Swqov id), SC mah (cf.
OHG mos ‘moss’, OCS praxu ‘ashes’ (cf. Sktpurisam ‘wealth’), OCS stanu
‘standing position, camp’ (cf. Skt stanam), OCS ttrnu ‘thorn’ (cf. Skt trnam
‘blade of grass’) (omitting dolu),7 and, following Pedersen, increasing the
number of *s-stems involved to four by adding OCS lesu ‘forest’ (cf. Gk
akooc, ‘sacred grove’). It might be noted, however, that most of these forms
may well originally have been *w-stems in Common Slavic, with differing
degrees of probability (daru, dolu,jadu, lesu, stand, tirnu, udu, vidd; see Orr
1996) therefore rendering unnecessary any reconstruction of *-om > *-u.
Two of them (vidd and daru) are also chosen as examples by Schelesniker
1964: 52, Poljakov 1991: 305, in their generally favourable discussions of
Hirt, and daru and stand, along with dvoru are cited by Agrell 1913: 92.
Vondrak 1898: 333-36 put forward a modification to Hirt’s theory
whereby all *-om > *-u , while unstressed *-os > *-u and stressed *-os >
*-o. Left at that stage, this theory would produce the wrong endings, and
therefore he proposes that *-o was generalised as a neut ending under pres­
sure from the pronoun to < *tod and the *s-stems, and that *-u was gener­
alised as a masc ending under pressure from the *u- and *i-stems.
Hirt 1904-05: 291 also cited some examples of the reverse process:
original IE stem-stressed masc forms appearing as neut forms in Slavic, al­
though many of these examples are problematic, e.g., OCS gnezdo ‘nest’
(cf. Skt nidah ‘camp, resting place’); R mojioko ‘milk’ (cf. Go miluks ‘milk’
[fern]); R ceAo ‘seat’ (cf. Go sitls ‘seat’ [masc]).
This theory never gained wide popularity, even as a topic of discussion.
Meillet 1897: 102-13 discussed it in some detail, generally favourably,
while suggesting some modifications. He pointed out (1897: 109) that gen­
der shifts were quite common in Indo-European. Ljapunov 1905: 5-6 criti­
cised it; Hujer 1910: 13-14 dealt with it, adding some discussion of subse­
quent literature, some favourable, some not. Rozwadowski 1914-15: 18
described it in an aside as “najracjonalniejszym”, but did not pursue the
matter. Later on, it was cited approvingly by some scholars, e.g.,
Schelesniker 1964: 52; Kortlandt 1975: 44-46, 1979: 262, etc.; in his 1975
monograph Kortlandt discusses some of the possible stages of this develop­
ment. Bemeker 1904: 370, passim, however, subjected several of Hirt’s pro­
posals to criticism, finding many counterexamples (especially in the devel­
opment of monosyllables such as *tdm > tu (< *-m ) ‘that’ masc acc sg; *kos1
1In his 1929 book Hirt replaced OCS muxu ‘moss’ with SC mah id < *muxu.
4.1.2. Hirt 101
> *ku(to) ‘who’, where the appearance of forms such as *tg, *kg might have
been expected (see 2.4.6 above); also OCS azu id < *-8m, where Skt aham
‘I’ points to final stress).
In his 1904-05 article Hirt returned to this problem, and expanded his
theory by attempting to derive the problematic OCS 3rd person sg ending
-tii from *-to, originally an IE middle ending, cf. Gk e6oto ‘s/he gave’
aorist, as opposed to the OR ending -tt, which may easily be derived from
the IE present. He proposed that this was an example where “... ist -o in
offener Silbe zu -■
&geworden (1904-05: 291)”, thereby providing a putative
counterexample to Fortunatov’s proposal that *-<?- > *-u in a final CLOSED
syllable (see 2.1.4, 2.4.7, and 4.1.1 above).
Prinz 1977 also bases his approach to the problem on accentuation. His
proposal can be summed up as follows: final STRESSED syllables were
never reduced, whereas final syllables which were never stressed were
weakened. He accepts (261-62) that a final *-s could raise a preceding *-o
to *-u.
Illic-Svityc 1979’
: 108-16 revived and modified Hirt’s theory as cited
above, dropping the part of the development relating to *-os > *-u postu­
lated by Hirt, and proposing that the masc acc *o-stem ending *-u (< *-dm)
was transferred to the nom very early, perhaps while it was still *-dm (1979:
166 fn. 77, modifying Leskien; such a change, however, would have seri­
ously jeopardised the masc/neut distinction). He (108-12; q.v. for further
discussion) listed some further supporting examples, citing the following
modern SI forms: SC pod ‘floor’ (cf. Gk jte6ov ‘ground’), SC lan ‘flax’ (cf.
Lat linum id), Sin meh - (cf. OHG mos ‘moss’ (neut)), OCz sit ‘twining’ (cf.
OHG seid ‘cord’ (neut)), SC van ‘outside’ (cf. Skt vanam ‘forest, wood’), R
neped ‘sequence’ (cf. Skt sardham ‘herd’), R (dial.) nepeu ‘salt pan’ (cf. Gk
xeqvov ‘vessel for sacrifice’), SC dren ‘plant name’ (cf. Gk teqxvo9 ‘twig
(neut)’), SC stit ‘shield’ (Lat scutum ‘shield’), SC prst ‘finger, digit’, OPr
pirsten ‘finger’), SC vosak ‘wax’ (OHG wahs ‘wax’ (neut)), R necm
‘battledore’ (cf. Sin pesto ‘nave, hub’), SC prid ‘addition, supplement’. Of
these, in addition to the examples discussed above, podu ( > SC pod) and
vunu ( > SC van) may well also have been original *«-stems, see Orr 1996.
One point that might be noted in favour of Hirt’s basic theory, discussed
at some length by Illic-Svityc 1979: 114-17, is the fact that several neut and
masc forms co-exist in the modern SI languages, e.g., CS1 *ttrnd > SC torno
‘thorn’; CS1 *tirnu > SC trn ‘grass’ (gen sg trna\ see above, although dis­
puted as a possible *«-stem by Illic-Svityc 1979: 165 fn. 65; CS1 *jezero >
SC jezero Take’, R osepo id; CS1 *jezerit > SC dial jezer id, R dial 03ep id).
102 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
Ebeling 1967: 580-82 subjected this theory to some criticism, dwelling
mainly on chronological factors: Vermeer 1991: 274 fn. 5, 276, 276 fn. 6,
280, 284, quoted it, and Illic-Svityc’s modification, with approval, citing
Ebeling’s objections briefly.
A table will make the main points of Hirt’s proposal clear.

Hirt concluded his 1904-05 article by saying that his theory posed fewer
problems than Fortunatov’s.8
4.1.3. Agrell
Another scholar to propose an explanation using accentuation, somewhat
similar to Hirt’s, was Agrell (1913: 47 passim). He suggested that the nor­
mal reflex of PIE *-os, *-om in Common Slavic was *-u, but that if the pre­
vious syllable was STRESSED and bore a RISING PITCH, the reflex was *-o.
He cited several examples which appeared to offer support for this theory

4.1.4. Mei Ilet 103
He later retracted this view in the face of the difficulties involved in
positing a plausible analogical development which would explain the gender
demarcations found in the earliest attestations of Slavic. Of course, Agrell
subsequently (1926) made the much more familiar suggestion that the CS1
neut *<5-stem nom/acc sg -o could be reconstructed as a bare stem (see also
3.2.3 above), rather than as a borrowing from the pronominal paradigm.
Agrell 1913: 93 saw the neut *s-stem nom/acc sg ending -o as a regular
development from *-os (“Unter den neutra hatten gleichzeitig die o-stamme
eine gewisse zeit schwankend Oder -o, DANEBEN ABER DIE ES-STaMME
SO GUT WIE AUSSCHLIESSLICH NUR -O [emphasis in the original-
RAO]”; he also cited examples of gender fluctuations involving the *s-
stems), but in his 1926 article (1926: 37-38) he made another suggestion,
which has surfaced in the literature from time to time: that the *s-stem end­
ing -o was itself the result of a morphological restructuring (cf. also
Fortunatov 1897: 164 fn. 1; Vondrak 1898: 335; Milewski 1932: 17; Ferrell
1965: 100; Galabov 1973: 8-9; as the latter puts it: “ ... liegen die
Schwierigkeiten nicht bei der Erklarung der Nominativ- und Akkusativ-
Formen der mannlichen o-Substantive, sondern UMGEKEHRT [emphasis
mine —RAO]... wir es mit einem ProzeB zu tun haben, bei dem die
phonetisch zu erwartenden Formen auf *--& allmahlich von solchen auf *-o
verdrangt werden.”).
Agrell pointed to *-slovu (< *kleuos) in compound proper names such
as Dobroslovu, which he saw as showing the development *-os > *-u . The
difficulties with this proposal are as follows:
a) It seems odd that the neut *s-stems did not simply transfer into the
emerging masc *d/n-stem declension, as did so many other neuts, if
indeed they underwent a period with *-u as the nom/acc sg ending.
b) -slovu in compounds such as Dobroslovu need not be an exact reflex
of IE *kleuos, as forms appearing in compounds are often different
from their simplex equivalents. The Gk cognate of slovo furnishes a
good example of this phenomenon: the name 2ocpcwXf]<; is a com­
pound of oocpog ‘wise’ and xXeog ‘fame’. There is another similar ex­
ample from Slavic: slava ‘glory’ appears as -slavu in compounds, e.g.,
Pol Wladyslaw, Boleslaw\ Cz Vaclav.
4.1.4 Meillet
Meanwhile Meillet 1914-15, 1916, 1922, 1965: 404-05 had developed a
new way of tackling the problem, positing two reflexes for both *-os and *-
dm, depending on the relative prominence of the word: in clitics and words
104 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
likely to be contracted in rapid speech the reflex of both *-os and *-6m
would be *-w, and in more prominent words the reflex would have been *-o.
This theory still fails to account for the following problems:
a) Which nouns (and adjectives!) would be likely to be slurred in rapid
speech? There are also some problems with pronominal forms:
Meillet 1916: 289 reconstructs a form *ton, which would have devel­
oped into either *tu or *to\ the particle *go was added to the latter to
form the gen-acc. Meillet suggests that “la forme *to etait celle a
laquelle on recourait pour insister sur la personne designee”.
b) Meillet generally leaves the development of the fern *a-stems out of
his framework, although in passing he does state: ... “c’est une par­
ticularity caracteristique du slave que d’opposer le masculin et le
feminin par la fai^on differente dont se comportent le nominatif sin-
gulier et au pluriel” (1965: 392). One might therefore expect some in­
stances of *-om > *-{) to be attested.
4.1.5. Hujer
Hujer 1910: 12-36 provides a useful discussion of the main theories which
had appeared by that date, and is frequently cited by subsequent scholars (cf.
Nandri§ 1969: 75-84; Ferrell 1965: 97-102).
In his 1920 work (26-30) he provides a further summary of the question
as it had evolved after 1910, starting off from Fortunatov and Leskien and
citing Agrell, Hirt, Rozwadowski, and Meillet. He comes down on the side
of Leskien, accepting all his arguments in favour of reconstructing *-os >
*-£>, and adding a few of his own (the CS1 prepositions po and pro, which he
compares with Lith pas ‘near’, Gk Jtoc; id, a dialectal form of Gk jiqoc; id
respectively, although, surprisingly, later on in the book (1920: 98) he sug­
gests that the *s-stem ending -o is morphological in origin.
4.1.6. Otr^bski
Otrqbski 1930a invokes sandhi as a possible pointer to a solution, arguing
that both *-os and *-om split into sandhi variants (see 2.5.4). He suggests
that *-u became stabilised in a greater number of forms in nominal and ver­
bal morphology—four (nom/acc sg masc *o-stem, 1st sg aor, 1st pi, 3rd sg
and pi), as opposed to two for *-o (neut nom/acc sg, 1st pi) because it was
narrower than *-o, and that “It appears that it was simply a tendency of the
Proto-Slavic language to have narrower vowels in word-final position, and
■
b was just such a vowel by comparison to -o (1930a: 3).” Otrqbski was
criticised by Milewski 1932: 23 fn. 1, who cited the paucity of actual exam­
ples of *-as, *-am, *-ar(see 2.1.2) developing to *-o.
4.1.9. Galabov 105
4.1.7. Milewski
Milewski 1931: 83 fn. 2, 90 treats the endings under discussion in passing.
His 1932 article, however, represents what might be called the first at­
tempt to deal comprehensively with the CS1 ALG, although many of his
proposals have not been generally accepted.
He sees (1932: 17) both *-os and *-om developing into *-u via *-as and
*-am. In his 1931 article (85 fn. 2) Milewski had accepted the bare-stern
theory for the neut, citing Agrell loc cit., but in his 1932 article he modified
this suggestion, proposing that neuts in *-om and *-o co-existed in Common
Slavic, with the former shifting to masc, while under this reconstruction the
*5--stems would have taken their *-o ending from the neut *<?-stems. He
pointed (1932: 17 fn.3) to what may well have been a similar situation in
Hittite, with -an and -a coexisting as neut nom/acc sg endings.
He also suggested (1932: 250, 255) including *-r as a cause of CS1 rais­
ing in final closed syllables (cf. OCS mad ‘mother’ < *mater, cf. Gk p.T|TT|0
id), thereby managing to include the problematic OCS 3rd sg ending -tu <
*-tor, cf. OCS beretu ‘s/he takes’ < *beretor, with the subsequent loss of *-r
(cf. Hirt’s explanation of OCS bratu ‘brother’).
4.1.8 Manczak
Somewhat similar to M eillet’s proposal in this context, Manczak 1958,
1969, 1977: 240^42, 1993: 180 (see also Schmalstieg 1983b: 217-21), uses
his theory of irregular sound change discussed above (see 2.5.3) to explain
the development of PIE *-os and *-om in Slavic. According to this theory
the regular development of *-o.v would have been *-o, and the ending occur­
ring more frequently (the masc nom sg) would have undergone a further de­
velopment to *-u. Meanwhile the regular reflex of *-dm would have been
*-g, but the irregular development *-o would have been used for the neut
nom/acc sg, and the masc acc sg would have undergone a further irregular
development to *-u.
4.1.9. Galabov
Galabov 1973: 11-17 accepts *-om > *-u as a given, and proposes that final
*-s in late Common Slavic caused a preceding vowel to raise, thereby offer­
ing a motivation for the development *-os > *-u. He further proposes that
the following forms in late Common Slavic all ended in *-5:
1) The masc nom sg *<5-stem, e.g., *vlukos ‘wolf’
2) The masc nom pi *6-stem, e.g., *vlukoisiwolves’
3) The imperative 2nd sg, e.g., *berois ‘take’
106 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
He also suggested including *-r as a cause of CS1 raising in final closed
syllables, following Milewski loc. cit., thereby managing to include the
problematic OCS 3rd sg ending -tu < *-tor, cf. OCS beretu ‘s/he takes’<
*beretor.
The difficulties with this theory, however, are twofold:
1) He has to propose a complicated morphological contamination for the
*-s to be added to the masc nom pi:
*toi vlkos > *tois vlkois (not *toi vlkoi as is normally proposed) > *tes
vlkes (raising before final *-s) > *tis vlkis > *ti vlci ‘these wolves’.91
0
2) Far more serious for his theory is the lack of raising in any other vow­
els before final *-s:
Neut Gen Sg *s-stem slovese ‘word’ < *kleueses
2nd Sg Aorist rece ‘said’ < *rekes
(Gen Sg) Nom/Ace PI *jo-/ja-stems du$% ‘souls’ < *dusjens
none of which show any raising. Galabov 1973: 16 dismisses this problem
by saying “Dieses besondere Verhalten der e-Vokale im Auslaut verdient
weiter erhohte Aufmerksamkeit.”
4.1.10. Velceva
Within the framework of her generative approach to the phonological devel­
opment of Common Slavic (Old Bulgarian in her terminology) Velceva
1988: 38, 59-67 postulates a sound-change *-as > *-us, which she recon­
structs as taking place very early, before the final stage of *-dm > *-u (1988:
60), but not prior to the Third Palatalisation (she follows Lunt 1981 in the
chronology of the palatalisations of velars, and Hirt, Milewski, Galabov loc.
cit. in proposing that *-r also caused the raising of *a (o) to *«).'°
One flaw in Velceva’s presentation is her treatment of the neut. She is
very vague about its development (1988: 55, 87 fn. 5), suggesting that *-o <
*-od was generalised “at some earlier time.” She does not mention the
problem of the *s-stems as such, in fact, the *.s-stem form that she does cite
9A modified form of this theory turns up in the literature, cf. Lunt 1989: 47 fn. 31,
where *-s is proposed as causing the raising of CS1 *-oi > *-i.
1
0In this context it has not been remarked that the reconstruction of *-r for verbs in
Slavic would have interesting implications for IE studies: so far only Celtic, Italic,
Tocharian and Anatolian have been attested with these forms, and they are quoted
as a classic case of an archaism retained by peripheral dialects (most recently, Sihler
1995: 472-74).
4.2.1. Liidtke & Georgiev 107
(1988: 37), uxo ‘ear’, is given as awsa- (Velceva’s notation), juxtaposed to
*starikos ‘elder’ (sta:rikas in Velceva’s notation), without the final *-s (see
also 2.3.2).
4.2. The Masculine Nominative and Accusative Singular and Neuter
Nominative and Accusative Singular of the *o-Stems: Morphological
Approaches
4.2.1. Liidtke & Georgiev
Liidtke 1966 and Georgiev 1969 both attempt to reconstruct the develop­
ment of CS1 morphology by severely restricting the use of ALG to explain
apparently intractable problems. Georgiev 1969: 37-50 argues against ALG
on grounds of phonetic plausibility. It should be noted, however, that Liidtke
and Georgiev do allow for some ALG, e.g., they reconstruct final *-dm as
simply dropping the final nasal, thus developing to *-o, instead of *-g. They
both deny the existence of qualitative ALG (e.g., *-8m > *-u; *-ons > *-y),
while admitting quantitative ALG (the shortening of long syllables in final
position, comparable to similar developments in Celtic, Germanic, Baltic,
and Italic; in fact, as pointed out in 2.2, the distinction is Liidtke’s).
Following Leskien, they propose that the regular phonological devel­
opment of *-os in Common Slavic was *-o. In contrast to most scholarship
in the field, however, they postulate that *-8m > *-o, with simple dropping
of the final nasal.
One table will suffice for presenting the views of both scholars:

108 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
This analysis has several advantages over the more traditional ones dis­
cussed above, because it manages to dispense with the troublesome sound-
change *-os > *-u , although its treatment of *-dm > *-u leaves a great deal
to be desired." In addition, it includes two otherwise unrelated issues:
1) It manages to avoid altogether the problem of whether the change
*-dm > *-u preceded the merger of *o and *a.
2) As with Vaillant 1950: 54, 210, 1958: 29, it explains plausibly why
the *-m of the masc nom/acc sg did not prevent the Third
Palatalisation from taking place: the ending would still have been *-o
when the Third Palatalisation was productive.
4.2.2 Feinberg
Feinberg 1978 starts off by accepting *-dm > *-u , and goes on to develop a
morphological framework for handling many of the problematic forms in
CS1 nominal declension. He also reconstructs a bare-stern neut nom/acc sg
*d-stem ending (-o < *-o) and incorporates it into his broader theory.
Feinberg proposes that the combined effect of the erasing of the distinc­
tion between theme vowel and desinence, the loss of final consonants, and
*-dm > *-u would have given rise to a non-automatic o ~ u alternation in
CS1 declensional endings, which would encompass both o{a)/u and d(a)/u(y)
(1978: 113-14). He sees numerous forms normally explained by ALG as
arising from the generalisation of either the -o- alternant or the -u- alternant.
In some ways his analysis is similar to Meillet’s proposal of twofold re­
flexes for *-os and *-om, and in some ways it is close to Oti^bski’s (less so
to Schmalstieg’s) proposal of sandhi variants (see 2.5.4, 4.1.4 above, and
4.7.2 below).
Feinberg’s analysis is hampered by several small difficulties. Despite an
apparently comprehensive discussion of the alternatives (superior to many
previous attempts) he does not consider the possibility of reconstructing
*-om > *-g. Although he does treat the loss of *-s as an important factor, he
does not discuss the full range of forms which it might have affected (1978:
113, 115, 116). Furthermore, it is not immediately clear that the originally
long {old) and short vowels {old) can be handled in parallel.1

1 Although Georgiev’s instinct is correct in many areas, his description of the
processes involved is curiously unsatisfactory. Many of his proposals consist in no
more than brief statements of what might have occurred, with very little discussion,
or even simply dogmatic assertions (cf. especially 1969: 37-38, criticised by
Andersen 1971: 951-52).
4.3.2. Szober 109
Despite these shortcomings, Feinberg’s analysis is probably the best
overall so far of the ones which use the traditional SI ALG. His major im­
provement over Leskien is the incorporation of the bare stem ending.
4.3. The Masculine Nominative and Accusative Singular and Neuter
Nominative and Accusative Singular of the *o-Stems: Refinements
4.3.1. Rozwadowski
Rozwadowski 1914-15: 14-8 cited numerous examples from the canonical
OCS texts and modern SI dialects that seem to show *-os > *-o, e.g.,
narodosi (Zographensis) ‘people-this’ < *narodos sis, rabotu ‘slave-this’ <
*rabo tas (Assemanianus, Marianus), and which are therefore often adduced
as evidence of *-os > *-o, sometimes without citing Rozwadowski (Otr^bski
1930a: 2; Diels 1932: 103; Rudnyckyj 1966: 657; Vermeer 1991: 280-81).
Although this interpretation of these forms is normally traced back to
Rozwadowski, Ljapunov 1905: 5-6 had already dismissed them, adhering to
Fortunatov’s theory. He cited earlier literature which had discussed these
forms, and suggested that the *-o- had developed from an original *-«-
(*-•&-) in strong position, adducing mozetosi ‘can-this’ ‘this person can’
(Marianus: John 7.49) as a clear example.
Lunt also criticises the acceptance of these data as evidence of *-os >
*-o in final syllables: “since long before that date such obviously late and
local phenomena have been seen as innovations characteristic of incipient
new Slavic languages (1987: 274 fn. 67)”, and calls them “long-forgotten
errors (1989: 53 fn. 49)”.
Rudnyckyj 1966: 657 also cites these forms. He deserves mention for
noting an another, more important set of forms, which provide stronger evi­
dence for assuming *-os > *-o in the masc nom sg *o-stem ending: personal
names from Old Polish, Ukrainian, etc.: OPol Boglo, Falo\ Ukr Cycjio,
K o3ao < *-os. Vermeer 1991: 280-81 cited these forms approvingly, adding
forms such as, e.g., R CadKo, SC Dmitrije (< *-jes < *-jos), etc. Krysko
1993, however, criticises the use of these data, see 4.4.5 below.
4.3.2. Szober
In contrast to most scholars, who start off from the masc *<5-stem ending -u,
giving a brief outline of theories of the origin of that form, Szober 1927 is
mainly concerned with the neut ending *-o, and treats the issue from that
point of view. He is one of the few scholars who actually subjects the theory
of a borrowing from the pronoun to < *tod to criticism, arguing (1927: 566)
that the fact that old neut *«- and ^-sterns simply transferred to the masc or
Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
110
fem,1
2 and were not remodelled after to < *tod, suggests that to < *tod
cannot have been as influential as usually believed.
He (1927: 570) suggests that the *-o ending has its origins in analogical
pressure from other neut forms with zero-desinences: the *s-stems (*-os-0),
the *men-stems (*men-0), the *rcf-stems (*nt-0), along with old neut *u-
stems (*-u-0), and *r-stems (*-2
-0). The old *d-stem neut nom/acc ending
inherited from Indo-European (*-o-m) would have been isolated within this
system, and Common Slavic would simply have dropped the *-m in order to
regularise it. This theory was also suggested as a possibility by Mikkola
1942: 186-87.
4.3.3. Koschmieder
In an oft-cited article Koschmieder 1956 combines data from accentuation
and morphology to propose a theory to explain the problematic endings
being discussed in this section.
Koschmieder 1956: 238-39 draws attention to the difficulty of recon­
structing *-os > *-u and *-dm > *-u . Briefly, he takes as his point of depar­
ture the proposal by Lehr-Splawiriski that the SI neo-acute and neo-circum­
flex arose as the result of the reduction of an original *-u- to a jer in the fol­
lowing syllable (the “second metatony”). Van Wijk 1923: 134-55, however,
had pointed out that the masc nom/acc sg *<5-stem ending, although a jer,
did not cause this metatony, citing forms such as R nom/acc sg zojioc
‘voice’, contrasting it with the gen pi form zojioc. Koschmieder 1956: 241
proposes that the morphological origin of the masc nom sg ending (a trans­
fer from the *«-stems) means that it cannot be used as evidence in support
of van Wijk’s proposal; the jer dates from AFTER the proposed metatony.
Koschmieder’s proposal was rated highly by Shevelov 1971a: 50.
4.3.4. Vaillant
While admitting the possibility of Leskien’s proposal regarding analogy
with the acc sg, Vaillant 1958: 29 proposed “une reduction speciale de la fi­
nale” in order to explain the nom sg masc. This theory is somewhat similar
to that proposed by Milewski loc. cit, although Vaillant would restrict the
“reduction” to the masc nom sg. He cited apparent parallels in Baltic, where
*-os is often reduced to *-s, side by side with *-as, cf. Latvian vards
1
2 Szober lists the following SI forms as old neuts: sott ‘salt’ (cf. Lat sal id); rnedu
‘honey’ (OIr mid ‘mead’ < *medu)\ this point is usually ignored in the literature. It
should not be forgotten, however, that there are actually very few forms involved.
4.3.5 Cekman 111
‘name’; Lith vardas id < *-os, see also Gauthiot 1913: 45, 57; Milewski loc.
cit.; Ferrell 1965: 98-99 fn.
He might also have noted similar phenomena in Germanic, where
Gothic has the reduction of IE *-os (cf. Go dags ‘day’) in the *o-stems, but
preserves -us in the *n-stems (cf. Go sutius ‘son’ < IE *-us), and Italic,
where Oscan has forms such as hiirz ‘garden’ (< *-tos, cf. Lat hortus id).1
3
1
4
Vaillant 1950: 54, 210, 1958: 29 uses his reconstruction of the Third
Palatalisation to date the raising of *o to *u (reduction of *-as, *-ati in his
terminology): it must have taken place AFTER the Third Palatalisation, in
order to explain endings such as < *-ikas, cf. Lith -ikas,H a following
high vowel (*-n) would have blocked the operation of the Third
Palatalisation; see also Liidtke 1966: 133.
For Slavic, however, one serious problem with this proposal is the fate
of the cluster that might have resulted from such a reduction: if, e.g., *orbos
> *orbs (*rabs/robs), why do we not find traces of paradigms such as nom
sg *ra acc sg *rabu; nom sg *go acc sg *godu, etc. (One way out of that
putative difficulty mi'ght to be suggest that paradigms such as *ra—*rabu
did actually arise, and then the acc sg was transferred to the nom by the pro­
cess first proposed by Leskien).
More recently, a similar theory has been advanced to explain the
troublesome NR masc *o-stem nom sg ending -e, see 4.4.3 below.
4.3.5 Cekman
Cekman 1979: 135-36 uses sandhi as an explanation for the CS1 reflexes of
*-os in this ending. He draws attention to an apparently similar phenomenon
in Sanskrit, where IE *-os#C > Skt -oC, cf. asvah ‘horse’ (< *-os#), but asvo
(< *-os#C), e.g., vrksah ‘tree’, but vrkso rohati ‘the tree grows’, and also
cites typological parallels from the later history of Indie, Avestan, and
Andalusian Spanish, as well as phonetic data, proposing that Common
Slavic may well have passed through a stage where sandhi was operating,
1
3Based on the Gmc data, Gauthiot 1913: 56 suggests that in apocope low vowels
are dropped prior to high vowels; Manczak 1980: 317-18, however, explains the
Gmc data where *-a- (< IE *-<?-) in final syllables drops in environments where *-u-
does not; cf. OHG tag ‘day’ < CGmc *dagaz, but sunu ‘son’ < CGmc *sunuz by the
fact that the Gmc *<5-stems were more frequent than the *«-stems, and therefore
their endings would have been more liable to reduction.
1
4Vaillant himself (1958: 52-54) sees the Second and Third Palatalisations as parts
of the same process.
112 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
without elaborating. Kortlandt 1979: 267, fn. 24 also seems to hint at such a
development for Common Slavic.
Cekman defends the phonetic plausibility of the CS1 ALG, arguing
against views expressed by Georgiev 1969: 37. His proposal for the neut *s-
stems (1979: 137) is that they simply dropped their *-s, in parallel with the
final *-m in the neut *o-stems, as the result of a “...more ancient ... non-
phonetic ... change.”
4.3.6. Lunt
As a footnote to his proposal that chronologically the CS1 Third Palatalisa­
tion was in fact the earliest of the three CS1 palatalisations, Lunt 1981: 17,
22, 45, 67, 83, proposes the following developments, offering reconstructed
paradigms in illustration:
1) *-is/*-us > *-ix/*-ux iruki)
2) *-05 (masc nom sg) > *-ox (by analogy); *-os (neut nom/acc sg) re­
mains
3) *-ox>*-ux> *-u\*-os>*-o.
Lunt does not, however, offer any explanation as to why *-x would have
caused raising while *-s would not have, apart from some brief discussion
based on distinctive features (1981: 83).
It will be noted that this proposal is direc'tly incompatible with
Vaillant’s as cited above (4.3.4). However, while citing Vaillant copiously
elsewhere, and discussing individual points, nowhere in his 1981 mono­
graph does Lunt directly answer his arguments as such. In his 1987 and
1993 articles, however, he does so.
The argument revolves around forms such as OCS nom sg ofici ‘father’
(< *ottkos) voc sg otide (< *ofike). As we have seen above, Vaillant sug­
gests that the fact that forms such as *ofici underwent the Third
Palatalisation shows that *-u must have been *-0(5) at that stage. Lunt 1987:
258-59 and fn. 22 dismisses Vaillant’s arguments by suggesting that too
much weight seems to be given to analogical processes, and points out that
Vaillant provides no paradigms to show how the proposed analogical spread
of *-c- < *-k- would actually have worked.
Lunt 1981: 51, 1993: 366-68 does offer partial paradigms illustrating
his proposed solutions, suggesting the following sequence:
1) Third Palatalisation (BdC [=Baudouin de Courtenay] in Lunt’s termi­
nology)
2) Raising of *-os> *-us
4.4.1. Sobolevskij 113
Lunt has amassed a formidable array of evidence to back up his suggestion
that BdC was in fact chronologically the first of the SI Palatalisations, and
has vigorously defended his proposal.
4.3.7. Conclusion
As we have seen, the scholarly consensus overwhelmingly accepts *-om >
*-u, while nowadays generally rejecting *-os > *-u , although the latter
sound change continues to find a small, but steady stream of support, pace
Vermeer.
The consensus may be summed up as follows :

4.4. The North Russian Masculine Nominative Singular of the *-o-Stems
In contrast to the rest of Slavic, the earliest attested North Russian shows -e
in the *o-stem nom sg masc, instead of the -u attested in the rest of Slavic.
The -e ending has spread quite widely, it extends beyond the nominal de­
clension, to the *-/- participle, e.g., e~bdajie ‘gave’ masc nom sg. This prob­
lematic form has been a subject of discussion for over a century, and many
recent discussions of *-os > *-u (Krysko, Vermeer, Zaliznjak) have been
centred on it, and ways of integrating it into a theory explaining the devel­
opment of *-os in Common Slavic.
4.4.1. Sobolevskij
Sobolevskij 1907: 191-93 proposed that the NR -e ending had its origin in
the *o-stem voc sg ending *-e. This theory came in for some criticism, al­
though for want of a better one, it was generally accepted by many scholars
for a long time.
In addition to quoting Sobolevskij, Bulaxovskij 1978: 31-33 cites some
cases, mainly from Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, and Belarusian, where an
original voc seems to have replaced a nom, e.g., Jure-, many of these, how­
114 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
ever, can be better explained by assuming the survival of *-o as a masc nom
sg ending in certain cases, e.g., Sin stnko ‘sonny’; in any case, most of these
forms are personal, or even proper names. Bulaxovskij does not explain how
voc forms could attain the comprehensive extension observable for North
Russian.
4.4.2. Ivanov
Ivanov 1985 sees the -e ending as a relic, a reflex of the old IE casus in-
defmitus (absolutive, see also 3.2.2, 3.2.3).
This theory never gained popularity; Ivanov was criticised by Zaliznjak
1988: 170, Vermeer 1991: 272, although Zaliznjak 1991: 236 was prepared
to say that: “In my opinion it is the most attractive of the morphological
hypotheses”.
4.4.3. Zaliznjak
Zaliznjak 1988: 169-71, 235-36 provides a brief discussions of some earlier
theories, and, citing discussions with Nikolaev and Dybo, proposes a theory
reminiscent of Vaillant, loc. cit., whereby *-os develops to a “mid-vowel
similar to *-a”, see also Nikolaev & Xelimskij 1990: 42. This vowel would
have further developed to *-n everywhere in Slavic except for North
Russian, where it would have developed to *-e. Zaliznjak points out that in
East Slavic the neut ^-sterns switched over to the nedt *o-stems very early,
and therefore in this case the *s-stems do not provide as strong a counterex­
ample to *-os > *-it as they do when the NR ending is not brought into the
picture. He also cites the equally mysterious SC gen pi ending -a, which he
derives from *-bb, pointing out that here, too, we have an example where a
jer has a special reflex in just one area of Slavic. For criticism of this theory,
see Vermeer 1991: 272, 282-83; Krysko 1993: 131.
4.4.4. Vermeer
Vermeer 1991: 285-90, 1994 proposes a fairly complex theory involving
the peripheral status of North Russian and language contact, specifically
periods of bilingualism involving speakers of Finnic.
He sees these factors as contributory in the following way:1
1) The Second Palatalisation did not reach vast areas of North
Russian, and therefore the lc/c alternation in the voc sg would have
been isolated in the *o-stem declension. Finnic languages do not
have a separate voc, and therefore it would have been easy for
4.4.5. Krysko 115
Finnic speakers under conditions of imperfect language learning to
drop that case, while also using its forms for other purposes.
2) In Finnic nom and acc are quite rigidly demarcated, and this factor
would have hindered the adoption of the *n-stem form (which
would have led to nom/acc syncretism), in contrast to the rest of
Slavic. Speakers of Finnic languages at various stages of language
shift to Russian may well have transferred the *-e ending from the
*/o-stems (after the development *-jos > *-je(s), and reinforced by
the voc ending *-e) as a nom ending after the loss of final *-s to
avoid syncretism with the neut nom/acc sg (*-o), and the masc acc
sg (*-«)> and added it to a non-alternating stem (Vermeer’s
example is zartrbk-). The *-e ending appears mostly in the
nominative, and the ending *-u is maintained in the acc sg. The
lack of reflexes of the Second Palatalisation would have made
sequences like *zarm>ke phonotactically possible in North Russian,
and therefore this new *-e ending would not have caused
palatalisation of a preceding velar (1994: 151-55). There would
have been less chance of confusion with the neut *jd- stems
because their *-e would always have followed a jod or a soft
consonant, whereas the *-e in masc forms would always have
followed a hard consonant
Plausible examples of Finnic influence have been proposed for Russian be­
fore, specifically the emergence of the second genitive and locative, see
Veenker 1967: 83-88. Although ingenious, Vermeer’s theory seems a little
laboured: one might suggest that Finnic did not have gender either, and yet
gender in North Russian shows no sign of disappearing (the losses of the
neut attested in R dialects are later). This in turn raises the question of why
Finnic influence did not result in the reintroduction of a universal nom/acc
distinction, not just the *d- and *a-stems, instead of the animate/inanimate
distinction. A more thoroughgoing restructuring of the case system might be
posited if Finnic influence were as strong as Vermeer suggests.
4.4.5. Krysko
Krysko 1993 begins by stating that no solution to the problems of the devel­
opment of CS1 *-os and *-om more convincing than Leskien 1876, 1907 has
yet appeared; he is non-committal with regard to the bare-stern (1993: 119).
He criticises much of the evidence for final *-os > *-o as presented by
Rudnyckyj, Vermeer, loc. cit. (1993: 122), and provides his own set of evi­
dence for the preservation of *-o as a masc nom sg ending, e.g., diminutive
116 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
forms in *-ko (cited by Bulaxovskij loc. cit. as original vocs); forms in *-ilo\
various toponyms, etc. He points out (1994: 35, 69, 75-77, 78-79) that in
Novgorod the *«-stems appear to have preserved their status as a distinct
class later than they did elsewhere in Slavic, and this may well have been a
factor inhibiting the choice of the masc *u-stem ending as a distinctively
masc ending after the loss of *-s. Krysko 1993: 132-36, 1994: 78 would
deny the voc any role in the rise of -e, preferring to ascribe it to a transfer
from the *yo-stems, fuelled by a drive to preserve the distinction between
the masc and neut, i.e.,

4.5. The Genitive Singular and Nominative/Accusative Plural of the
Feminine *(j)a-Stems, the Accusative Plural of the Masculine *(j)o-
Stems, and the Problem of -e3: Phonetic/Phonological Approaches
This is also a very complicated set of forms. The *a-stem nom/acc ending
and *<5-stem acc ending on their own have not generated much scholarly
discussion; they are almost always handled by citing *-ons > *-y, with vari­
ous intermediate stages being proposed (see Mikkola, Shevelov, and
Schmalstieg, cited in 2.1.4.). The *yd-stem and *jd-stem acc pi endings,
however, have *-j$, thus providing evidence for a phonological alternation
*-y/-j%. In the fem stems this ending has further spread to the gen sg
(see Vaillant 1958: 81; Furdal 1961: 60-62).
Properly speaking, the *-j$ form cited above is only attested in South
Slavic. North Slavic shows *-e here, canonically referred to as -e3, which is
4.5.1. Fortunatov 117
also a topic with an extensive literature.1
5 It is closely related to -<
?3, and to
the development of the pres act part sf (see 6.2). Many scholars link it to
similar dialectalisms in the pres act part sf masc/neut, which is attested in
North Slavic as -a and in South Slavic as -y.
Most scholars take *-£ as basic and attempt to devise a plausible expla­
nation for *-<?3(but see Zubaty 1893: 511-14).
NS1 -<?3 is almost certainly a morphological, and not a phonological phe­
nomenon, as several authors have pointed out. Final *-(/')<; is quite possible
in North Slavic, as the following forms show:
1) The acc sg of the personal pronouns, e.g., OCS ‘me’, t$ ‘you’,
‘self’, cf. Pol mi% ‘me’, ci% ‘you’, si% ‘self’.
2) The nom/acc sg of the neut *n-stems, i.e., *-men > CS1 *-m& cf. OCS
imei ‘name’, Pol imi%- id, R umh id < *-^.
3) The nom/acc sg masc/neut of the Class III pres act part sf, i.e., OCS
znaj% ‘knowing’, cf. OPol szukaj% ‘searching’, R imea ‘having’ <
*-h-
Nevertheless, several authors have proposed mainly phonetic or phonologi­
cal explanations for -e3.'6A selection is given below:
4.5.1 Fortunatov
Citing possible parallels with Lithuanian, Fortunatov 1957: 2: 167-72, 185
hypothesised the existence of two original front nasals in CS1: *-<* and *-/<’;
in South Slavic *-i$ had fallen together with *-<*, while in North Slavic it
had merged with *-e. Fortunatov was followed by Ljapunov 1905: 36.1
7
A similar proposal was put forward by van Wijk 1916: 461-63, who
suggested that Common Slavic originally had two front nasal vowels, which
1
5The “3” refers to the origin of the *e. SI *e is reconstructed as coming from two
other sources:
ex< IE *e
e2<IE *oi, *ai
16Certain authors combine morphological and phonological factors in their argu­
mentation, and it would be difficult to find someone who would suggest purely
phonological or purely morphological explanations.
17Kuznecov 1953: 42-43, 1961b: 78-80, offered some discussion of the issue,
subjecting especially Fortunatov to substantial criticism. In this context Kuznecov
brought up several of the problems often associated with ALG: the fact that such
changes are only attested in word-final position; whether the combinations under
discussion always gave the same result; whether the presence or absence of *-t in
early Common Slavic really could lead to such divergent reflexes, etc.
118 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
were distinguished in North Slavic (developing to *-^ and *-e) and merging
into *-£ in South Slavic.
The number of nasal vowels reconstructed for Common Slavic was in­
creased by Kortlandt 1979: 261 to six. He traces *-e3 back to *eN, which he
describes as the “high mid-vowel which yielded South Slavic *-£ and North
Slavic and suggests that its backed equivalent was *yN, which devel­
oped to *-y all over Slavic.
As a general comment, it should be pointed out that there is no trace of
any of the distinctions proposed outside final syllables; in fact, Kortlandt
1979: 267 specifically states: “I find no trace of *aN in non-final syllables.”,
without admitting that this poses a serious problem for the whole theory.
Ferrell 1971 provides a brief discussion of the relevant literature. He
suggests that the reason for the divergent reflexes might be sought in a drive
to reduce the number of possible soft alternants of *-y, rather than the raw
number of front nasal vowels. He accepts Zubaty’s suggestion that *-e was
the normal reflex of *-jas, and goes on to suggest that a decisive cause of
the divergent development (resulting in an *-y/-j% alternation in South Slavic
and an *-y/-je alternation in North Slavic) could have been a drive to reduce
the number of possible soft alternants of *-y from three to two (SI *-y would
have passed through a stage of alternating with *-i (*o//<5-stem instr pi), *-j$
{*d/jo—stem acc pi), and *-je (*a/ja-stem acc pi); South Slavic would have
dropped the *-je alternant, and North Slavic the *-j% alternant).
4.5.2. Diels
Diels 1914 rejected the idea of originally different endings as a dialectal
isogloss within CS1, and put forward a proposal variations of which have
become a commonplace in the literature: the fact that -e3 mostly occurs in
languages where CS1 develops either wholly or partially to -’a. He sug­
gests that the origin of -<
?3 is to be sought in the fact that the endings where it
occurs were the only ones where an original was preceded by (C)*-j-
(“stark erweicht”) as opposed to a simple soft consonant, and that in North
Slavic *-£ after *-j- denasalised in the direction of *-e\ the *-e found in OR
texts would not actually have been *-^, but “ ... ein e-Laut ... der dem
sonstigen russ. e in der Vokalqualitat ahnelte.”
It might be briefly noted that Diels is proposing that CS1 Ijl is here the
cause of DENASALISATION, while several other scholars (see 2.4.7) imply
that Ijl PRESERVES nasalisation.
4.6.1. Zubaty 119
4.5.3. Milewski
Milewski 1932: 5-8, 20, 23, 28, deals with -e3 as part of his wider frame­
work for handling the development of long diphthongs in Common Slavic.
He suggests (1932: 7) that in North Slavic long diphthongs lost their second
component, and that -e3 is to be derived from *-jas < *-jans (see also 1932:
27-30), thereby also offering explanations of other forms. In contrast, he
sees the South Slavic ending as derived from *-ans, *-ons, also < *-ans,
*-dns.
Zucha 1986 argues that a strict application of relative chronology can be
used to explain the nom pi and gen sg of the *d-stems (*-y), -e3, and the NS1
nom sg masc pres act part sf (-a, see also 6.2.1). He would follow
Milewski’s proposed line of development for *-ons > *-y. (see 2.4.5), and
would suggest that the raising and denasalisation proposed therein would
have affected all vowels in North Slavic, and all vowels except in South
Slavic, with subsequent analogical spreads.
4.5.4. Shevelov
Somewhat tentatively, Shevelov 1964: 335-36 suggests that in North Slavic
the *-n ending that would have arisen in the masc *jd-stem acc pi (*k0an-eN
< *konjens ‘horses’) would have been “out of the pattern”, and that it was
lost as the result of a “latent universal tendency” to reduce endings.
Shevelov himself seems uneasy with this suggestion, and the arguments he
offers to explain why other endings did not undergo a similar reduction are
unconvincing.
Basing himself on Mares 1965’s reconstruction of the development of
CS1 phonology, Trummer 1978 attempts to include the emergence of -e
under a general theory of CS1 nasal vowels. He suggests (1978: 260-61) that
in the forms under discussion front nasals tended to open and to stabilise,
and that the nasal quality could either have been lost or maintained.
4.6. The Genitive Singular and Nominative/Accusative Plural of the
Feminine *(/)a-Stems, the Accusative Plural of the Masculine *(/)o-
Stems, and the Problem of -e3: Morphological Approaches
4.6.1. Zubaty
Zubaty 1893: 493-501 discusses some earlier theories, and suggests that -e3
is the reflex of *-jas (original *ja-stem gen sg/nom acc pi ending), which
spread to the old */e-stems, and then to the *jo-stems in North Slavic, and
that the attested in South Slavic (508-17) was originally confined to the
120 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
*jd-stems and spread from there to the *ja-stems. He points to other exam­
ples of declensional mixture from elsewhere in Slavic, and goes on to sug­
gest that -e3 spread to the */'<5-stems in North Slavic because would have
developed to -’a and threatened the obliteration of distinctions between gen
sg and nom/voc/acc du on the one hand and acc pi on the other, and that
spread to the *jd-stems in South Slavic because *-je showed a tendency to
develop into *-ja in these languages, which would also have threatened to
obliterate number distinctions. The two developments may be seen as mirror
images of each other. Hujer 1910: 99-109, 1920: 37, 45-46 followed
Zubaty, with some modifications.1

4.6.2. Furdal
Furdal 1961: 60-61 sees the spread of -e3 in Russian, Czech, Slovak, and
Upper and Lower Sorbian as an attempt to prevent the *d-stem nom sg and
pi falling together as a result of the loss of *-s (see also 5.3.7). He proposes
that *-e was introduced, first into the *ja-stem acc pi, and then the */'d-stem
acc pi, and subsequently to the nom pi and gen sg, in order to avoid the
threatened homonymy. He goes on to suggest that NS1 linguistic unity was
still strong enough at the time for the *-e to spread to Polish in these forms,
although there was less reason for the shift in Polish, as the nasals were
preserved.
1
8 Vaillant 1958: 48-49 does not seem to attach much significance to the difference
between and *-e; he describes it as “ ... surement un simple flottement de
prononciation qui n’est devenu qu’apres coup divergence dialectale.” He deserves
mention here, however, for his suggestion that the */'d-stem gen sg, always identical
to the nom and acc pi, can be explained under this heading (1958: 80-81).
4.6.4. Schmalstieg 121
4.6.3. Schelesniker
Schelesniker 1964: 24-29, 35—
40 proposes a morphological restructuring
which seems to take care of many of the difficulties. For South Slavic, he
sees a transfer of the *0- and */'<5-stem acc pi (assisted by the pronominal Po­
sterns) onto the *a- and *ja-stems (1964: 35-36), and thence to the nom pi.
For North Slavic, however, he sees the development as proceeding in
essentially the opposite direction, starting in the *a- and *ya-stems.
According to Schelesniker the original *ja-stem acc pi ending would have
been *-as, which he sees as developing to *-e (*-d), and then spreading as
such to the nom pi and the */<5-stem acc pi.
Similar to Zubaty, Schelesniker, loc. cit., Moszyriski 1984: 231-34, 244,
286-87 proposes that the *-%/-e contrast originated in the merger of the nom
and acc pi of the *yd-stems. The nom pi would originally have ended in
*-jas (> *-e) and the acc pi in *-jans (> He suggests that the nom and
acc pi endings would have been merged, but that the merger followed dif­
ferent paths in North Slavic and South Slavic: in North Slavic it would have
been the nom pi ending *-e which was generalised, whereas in South Slavic
it would have been the acc pi ending *-£. The original acc pi ending,
whether *-e or *-£, would then have spread to the *o-stem acc pi, and sub­
sequently to the If adjectives and the pronoun *tu.
4.6.4. Schmalstieg
Schmalstieg 1968b suggests a morphological, analogy-based solution which
has parallels in Baltic. The impetus for the development, according to
Schmalstieg, would have come from the adjective. According to his hypoth­
esis, two variants, *-ans and *-as would have coexisted (*-as would be the
reflex of a proposed early denasalisation before *-s in final position, and
then the new *-ans endings would arise, partly by analogy to *-ans- which
would have been preserved in word-internal position, and partly from
*-an(t)s). He further suggests that the *-e/-% alternations are the results of
the different treatments of the many possible reflexes arising from the
contaminations of the original alternants (e.g., gen sg fem of the If adj
*-(j)as + *-jans > *jejz > *-je; *-j$ < *jqj%. these alternations would later
spread to the rest of the paradigm.
Georgiev 1969: 44—
45, 66-67 proposes that *-£ and *-e are the result of
the generalisation of his reconstructed BS1 sandhi variants: PIE *-jds
(preconsonantal) > CS1 *-(j)e, generalised in North Slavic, and PIE *-jons
(prevocalic) > CS1 *-(/)£, generalised in South Slavic (see also 6.2.2) The
motivation giving rise to such variants is not clear, especially the fate of
122 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
final *-s in this context. If this theory were valid, one might expect to find
more instances of IE *s- mobile in Slavic (e.g., Eng small, R moji-) than we
actually do (cf. Shevelov 1964: 231-33); Slavic tends to have fewer exam­
ples of *s- mobile than other IE language families.
4.7. The Nominative Plural of the Masculine *o-Stems
This is a very difficult problem in SI historical linguistics, and a wide variety
of solutions have been proposed. It rivals the nom sg masc *<5-stem ending
in the variety of explanations and variants which have been brought to bear.
The CS1 masc *<5-stem nom pi ending is normally reconstructed as *-oi,
cognate with similar forms in Baltic, Greek, Celtic, Italic, etc. From the ear­
liest stages of IE scholarship, the ending has been seen as a borrowing from
the pronominal declension into the nominal, see, e.g., Leskien 1876: 80-83,
and the earlier literature cited therein. It causes the Second Palatalisation,
which, for many scholars, leads inexorably to the conclusion that *-oi (*-ai)
must be reconstructed in this ending. The normally-accepted development of
Common Slavic *-oi (*-ai), however, is *-e, which most scholars take as
basic; in the nom pi masc, however, we find *-/. To compound the problem,
the loc sg of the masc/neut *<5-stems and the dat/loc sg of the fem *a-stems
is also reconstructed as *-oi- (< *-di/*-ai)\ this form does have the expected
*-e. Accentuation is often reconstructed as a factor in this form; cf. Hirt,
Streitberg, Fortunatov, Liidtke, cited below. A parallel’development may be
seen in Lithuanian, where *-ai (*-oi) sometimes develops to *-ie and some­
times to *-ai.
4.7.1. Hirt
Many scholars have resorted to stress or accentuation to attempt to explain
these forms. As part of his stress-based framework, cited in 4.1.2 above,
Hirt 1892: 350-51 suggested that the difference between stressed and un­
stressed *-o in word-final position could also be seen in the apparent bifur­
cation of *-oi (*-ai) into *-e and *-/, with *-e being the stressed reflex and
*-i the unstressed.1
9Streitberg 1892: 281-82 seems unsure about this form;
he starts off by treating it as the reflex of original “schleifende Betonung
1
9A similar solution was proposed by Liidtke 1966: 129-31, who reconstructs the
development of an accent-based *-gi/*-oi alternation, where *-gi (originally un­
stressed) would have developed to *-i (causing the Second Palatalisation) and *-6i
(originally stressed) to *-e. These endings would have been redistributed according
to morphological categories.
4.7.3. Vaillant 123
(rising tone)”, but then goes on to concede that: “Vielleicht, daB man
dagegen mit Hirt an einen EinfluB der Akzentstellung denken darf.”
Fortunatov 1957: 1: 344, 2: 186-88, 408 also cited accentual differences
to explain the occurrence of -i; he suggested that in final position CS1 *-e (<
*-oi(*-ai); *-<?) developed to *-/ under rising tone. Hujer 1910: 63-74, 1920:
33-35 also saw the origin of these forms as arising from differences in ac­
cent and intonation: an acute 4 diphthong in final position would have
developed to *-/ (which he saw as the basic development of word-final CS1
*-oi/*-ai) while a circumflex diphthong would have developed into *4 in a
closed syllable and *-e in an open one.
Milewski 1932: 21-23, however, gives a fairly comprehensive list of
forms with *-e and *-/, and points out that the differences cannot be due to
accent, as both rising and falling pitch occur with both *4 and *-e. He sug­
gests that *4 is the basic reflex of *-oi, *-ai in word-final position, and ex­
plains occurrences of word-final *-e by morphological variation, pointing
out that it only occurs in hard forms, where there is an *-<?/*-/ alternation.
Manczak 1969: 62 (also cited by Schmalstieg 1983b: 218) suggests that
the *4 ending in this form is the result of irregular sound change; the regular
reflex being, of course, *-<?.
4.7.2. Otr^bski
Otr^bski 1930a: 4-6 includes this form in his proposed framework of origi­
nal sandhi variants, later generalised for morphological purposes. He sees
*4 as the normal continuant of CS1 *-oi. He suggests that the earliest stage
of development would have been *-oi > which would subsequently
have developed to *4. As with the developments of *-os, *-dm (see 4.1.6
above), the form with the higher vowel (*-i in this case) would have been
used for a larger number of forms (three, as opposed to one for *-e).
4.7.3. Vaillant
Both Vaillant 1958: 33-34 and Mares 1962: 20 suggested morphological
solutions. Vaillant’s is that the masc nom pi *o-stem ending *4 may have
been taken over from the *jd-stems, where *-joi > *-jei > *-ji by a straight­
forward phonological development, and Mares’ that the original nominal
*-ds ending fused with the pronominal ending *-oi to produce *-ois, which
would have developed to *-/, see also Gal&bov 1973:11-17.
Georgiev 1969: 57 seems to have the most suitable proposal so far. He
sees one of the main reasons for the introduction of the ending 4 as the need
to keep the masc nom pi distinct from the neut nom/acc du (see also Leskien
124 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
1876: 82). This proposal works fairly well for the *o-stems, but runs into a
serious difficulty when we consider the *jo-stems, e.g.,
*o-stem neut nom/acc du meste ‘places’—masc nom pi vluci ‘wolves’
*jd-stem neut nom/acc du polji ‘fields’—masc nom pi vluci ‘wolves’
(vozjdi ‘leaders’)20
4.7.4. Shevelov
Parallel to his proposal for *-e3, Shevelov 1964: 287-88 sees the replace­
ment of the expected *-e in the masc nom pi by *-i in the fact that *-e
“would have been completely isolated in the system of marking the masc
nom pi, whereas *-i could have been supported by the *jo-stem ending (*-/
by regular development *-joi > *-jei > *-ji), and the pronominal ending.”
However, in North Slavic *-e would have been supported by the pres­
ence of this form as a nom/acc pi ending for the *jd-stems, which throws
this part of the theory into question.
4.7.5. Mathiassen
Mathiassen 1971 provides a review of the literature to date, and supplies a
suggestion of his own: that the presence or absence of a morpheme bound­
ary is decisive; forms where a morpheme boundary would have separated
the *-6-{*-d-) and *-i- would have developed to *-e„ while forms with no
morpheme boundary would have developed to *-/.
4.8. The Dative Singular of the Masculine/Neuter *o-Stems and the
Instrumental Plural of the Masculine/Neuter *d-Stems
As is common practice, these forms (dat sg -u; instr pi -y) should be dis­
cussed under the same heading, as they symbolise many of the problems en­
countered in the study of the CS1 ALG. As we have seen (2.2), many schol­
ars have attempted to derive them directly from *-oi and *-6is respectively,
similar to their alleged Gk, Lith, and Skt cognates.
Jasanoff 1983a: 144^15, 1983b: 189 linked both the dat sg and the instr
pi endings to the masc *men-stem nom sg ending *-y (see 4.9.2 and 5.5
below) and the gen pi ending -u (see 6.1.1), and suggested that all four end­
ings taken together provided evidence for an ALG *-o > *-u. His hypothe­
sised development would therefore involve evolutions similar to the tradi­
tional theories, although he is one of the few such scholars to offer a fairly
detailed explanation.
20A similar problem is furnished by the 2nd pi imperative.
4.8.1. The Dative Singular 125
4.8.1. The Dative Singular
With regard to the masc/neut dat sg *<5-stem ending, this analysis will take
as its starting point Shevelov 1964: 156: “Whatever its source, it is an in­
truder into the paradigm, due to an interplay of morphological factors”, al­
though the exact nature of the intrusion remains to be discussed.
From different starting points, Otr^bski 1930a: 14; Ebeling 1963: 31;
Ltidtke 1966: 122-23; Georgiev 1969: 54-56; Lockwood 1969: 136-37;
Maziulis 1969, 1970: 106-27, 272-88, 319, 330-31; Feinberg 1978: 116;
Kortlandt 1979: 265, 1983: 174—
75; Schmalstieg 1986b; Janda 1996: 84,2

have all hypothesised that the dat sg form may actually be reconstructed as
*-ou, or even *-6, rather then the *-di reconstructed mainly on the basis of
Greek (cf. Luxcp ‘w olf dat sg < *-eli­
citing and criticising Schleicher, Leskien 1876: 57-59 made a sugges­
tion that still surfaces from time to time in the literature, with some varia­
tions: that the CS1 dat sg *<5-stem ending *-u (along with the Lith dat sg Po­
stern ending *-«/) w.as originally borrowed from the *u-stems. Leskien’s
proposed exact path of development is fairly complicated: the original Po­
stern dat sg ending *-di and the loc sg ending *-oi (*-ai and *-ai in
Leskien’s notation) would have merged with the shortening of long diph­
thongs in Common Slavic (e.g., OCS vluce ‘wolf’ loc sg could have had
either dat or loc function, and the *n-stem loc ending *-u would have been
borrowed as an alternative dat/loc ending, and then later specialised as a dat
under the influence of pronominal forms such as, e.g., OCS tomu ‘this’ dat
sg).
Variations on this theory were proposed by Endzelins 1911: 160;
Georgiev 1969: 54-56; Maziulis 1970: 117-18 and fn. 7, 330-31, who also
cites a personal communication from Toporov making a similar argument,
andPoljakov 1995: 224—
25.
As part of his theory of irregular sound change due to frequency of
occurrence, Mariczak 1969: 62, suggests that the CS1 *<5-stem dat sg *-u can
be seen as a case of “reduction moins avancee” of CS1 *-di, as can the Po­
stern instr pi ending.
Hujer 1910: 129-35, 1920: 31-32 cites older literature and proposes that
the ending comes from adverbial forms such as e.g., Gk itob ‘where’, oitoti
21 Ebeling and Kortlandt actually see *-di as developing into *-du as the first stage
in this process.
126 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
‘where’, OCS vruchu ‘above’, dolu ‘down’, tu ‘here’, onude ‘there’, OPr
pirsdau ‘before’, pansdau ‘afterwards’.
Milewski 1932: 9-12 criticised Hujer, pointing out that the forms that
he used were gen or abl rather than loc in meaning, and defended the recon­
struction of *-di > *-u, citing examples from Italic, Greek, and Celtic in
support of such a development.
Mares 1962: 20 fn. 16 suggested that the original *jn-stem dat sg ending
would have been *-ieuei, which later underwent dissimilation to *-uei, fol­
lowed by metathesis to *-ieu, which would then have developed to *- ’ii.
This *- ’ii would have taken over by the */o-stems, and subsequently by the
*o-stems. Mares was criticised by Hamm 1966: 42.
On numerous occasions (e.g., 1968b: 45, 51, 1980: 44, 1983b: 156, etc.)
Schmalstieg has suggested that the *o-stem dat sg ending derives from *-om
(*-am), which would be parallel to the Latvian -am, originally an adjectival
ending, e.g., cilvekam ‘man’ dat sg, with early sporadic denasalisation of
*-am to *-«, foreshadowing later developments in East Slavic, Serbo-
Croatian, Slovenian, Czech, Slovak, Upper and Lower Sorbian.
Schmalstieg does not explain why this form would not have been in­
cluded in his proposed development of sandhi variants *-g and *-u . For the
instr pi he is more non-committal, offering a number of tentative sugges­
tions.
4.8.2. The Instrumental Plural
As we saw above (2.2), several scholars see the *<3-stem instr pi *-y as the
direct phonological reflex of IE *-dis, mainly on the basis of forms in
Sanskrit and Lithuanian. Some scholars have offered morphological solu­
tions.
Fortunatov 1957: 2: 422-23 proposed that there was an IE instr pi suffix
*-his, which combined with the theme vowel of the *o-stems to give *-ohis
in Balto-Slavic. The loss of intervocalic *-h- would have resulted in a diph­
thong *-ois, which would have subsequently developed to CS1 *-y. Meillet
1897: 105, 1914-15: 4-5, 1916: 288, 1965: 395 suggested that the appar­
ently different developments in *-di and *-dis could be explained by the in­
fluence of final *-s, which would have caused *-dis to develop to *-y
Hujer 1910: 160-64, 1920: 35-36, saw the form in question as a back
formation from the *y<5-stem ending *-i (< *-eis)\ the *-y ending would have
been borrowed as a hard alternant; Hujer was followed by Liidtke 1966:
128. Again, Milewski 1932: 2-3, 7, criticises Hujer’s proposal, pointing out
that the alternation *-y/-i is actually quite rare in the earliest Slavic. He pro­
4.9.1. Leskien 127
posed that *-dis > *-ds > *-us> *-y by his putative regular CS1 development
whereby original long diphthongs lost their second component. Mares 1962:
20 proposed that the *<5-stem instr pi could be seen as a contamination of
two originally distinct endings: *-oimi(s) and *-ois, which could have
merged in *-oins, which would later, of course, have developed to *-y.
Mikkola 1950: 31-32 suggested that one way out of the impasse was to
suggest that the instr pi ending was originally a neut adverbial form, similar
to forms such as, e.g., maly ‘few’;paky ‘again’. Mikkola’s solution was not
taken up.
Georgiev 1969: 41^12, 60-61 discussed various theories and offered the
suggestion that the *-y ending was an original BS1 *u-stem instr pi ending
extended to the *o-stems, cf. Lith sunums ‘sons’ dat pi; he saw a BS1 devel­
opment *-ums > *-us> *-u (*-y).
As part of his theory that Baltic and Slavic can be reconstructed with
only four original cases, Maziulis 1970: 233^10, 333-35 suggests that the
Lith *d-stem ending *-ais is to be linked not to CS1 *-y, but to the CS1 *<5-
stem loc pi ending *-exu, and that CS1 *-y may be traced back to (168-70,
236-37, 334-35) another “loc.-instr.”ending *-ds (> *-us> *-y; see also
Lunt 1981: 46 for a similar, more tentative proposal). Poljakov 1995: 245-
47 describes this theory as “schwer zu verstehen”, and offers a comprehen­
sive discussion, citing a great deal of earlier literature, and describes the
problem of this ending as “wahrscheinlich ... unlosbar”.
4.9. The Nominative Singular of the Masculine *men-Stems
This form has a variety of endings attested in the modem SI languages (see
5.5). However, the comparatively rare *-y ending is the most problematic,
and most of the scholarly discussion has centred on it, usually citing the
form kamy ‘stone’ as canonical. Many of the ALG cited above have been
cited as explanations for it; *-ons > *-y (e.g., Shevelov 1964: 332-33); *-d >
*-u (Jasanoff 1983a) *-on > *-y (Kortlandt 1983: 168-69). Bernstejn 1974:
190 proposes that related forms such as kam ‘stone’ can be handled with
*-om > *-u.
4.9.1. Leskien
As with several other complicated forms, Leskien 1876: 13 made a proposal
which is still accepted, with variations, by many scholars in the field: he de­
rived OCS kamy from IE *akman-s, thus providing another example of
*-ons > *-y. This proposal was extended by Mares 1962: 20, who recon­
structed all non-neut C-stem nom sgs with *-s, e.g., kamy < *akmons, mati
128 Chapter 4. Some Proposals So Far
‘mother’< *maters (?) [sic—RAO]; he was followed by Holzer 1980: 10.
He therefore derived the *-y in kamy from *-ons, which, according to the
traditional ALG creates no problems.
4.9.2. Streitberg
Streitberg 1892: 265 included *kamy among the forms which he used as
support for his theory that CS1 final circumflex *-d developed to *-«. With
some modifications, this theory was later followed by Duridanov 1968 and
Jasanoff 1983a: 139-42, 1983b, who proposed an ALG *-d > *-u to explain
OCS kamy, deriving it directly from *kamd, and linking it to Lith akmud
‘stone’, also < *-<?. He was criticised by Schmalstieg 1983c: 153, who pre­
ferred to a solution whereby unstressed *-d > *-u, and Kortlandt 1983: 168-
69, who stated that “Jasanoff’s objections against *-dn cannot be main­
tained”, see also Orr 1986.
4.9.3. Zubaty
Zubaty 1893: 502-03 pointed to the existence of related forms in *-a, e.g.,
kama ‘stone’, which he saw as a problem for Streitberg loc. cit., and applied
his proposal of IE sandhi variants continued into Slavic. He suggested that
IE *-dn developed to *-u and that *-o developed to *-a, thus offering expla­
nations for forms such as kamy ‘stone’ (< *kamon and kama < *kamd; see
also below). He was followed by Hujer 1910: 76. Van Wijk 1916: 283,
however, criticised Zubaty’s proposal, maintaining that no form *kama was
attested side by side with *kamy, which would be expected if Zubaty ’s pro­
posed developments were correct. Van Wijk was followed by many other
scholars; however, forms such as kama are actually quite widespread in
Slavic (see 5.5). Milewski 1931: 91, 1932: 4, 13, 235 echoed van Wijk’s
criticism of Zubaty and Hujer.
4.9.4. Otr^bski
Otr^bski 1954: 28 proposed that CS1 *-a and *-d did not merge in word-
final position in CS1 except in monosyllables (see 2.4.6), and that word-final
*-d developed to *-u, i.e., kamy < *kamd.
4.9.5. Georgiev
Georgiev 1969: 111-27 offers a fairly complicated solution to the problem
of the *-y ending, citing the combined influence of several factors.
He is one of the scholars to cite the forms in -a as relevant, deriving the
*-a directly from CS1 *-6 (1969: 117-18, 120). He points to the fact that in
4.10. Conclusion 129
many of its attestations in Old Church Slavonic the form kamy has acc
meaning, and that the normal development of a C-stem acc pi should have
been CS1 *akm(n)uns > *akmu(x) > OCS kamy (1969: 120-23). He also
suggests that a proportional analogy with the *«-stems could have arisen in
these forms (he cites the OCS form ljuby ‘love’ which could be either nom
sg or acc pi): nom sg brady ‘axe’/gen sg, etc., braduve ~ nom sg X/gen sg,
etc., kamene. He suggests that a combination of these factors could have
caused the emergence of the *-y ending in this form. Elsewhere (see 2.5.4,
4.6.4, 6.2.2) Georgiev has proposed sandhi variants for Common Slavic; he
also utilises them here (1969: 125), suggesting that the preconsonantal vari­
ant (*-us (> *u (*-y))) may have spread to some extent.
4.10. Conclusion
The sheer variety of solutions proposed for some of the more problematic
forms in Common Slavic may be glimpsed from the material cited in this
chapter. The overwhelming majority of proposals utilise ALG, despite all
the problems entailed.'
In the next chapter solutions will be proposed for most of the forms dis­
cussed, and for the remaining forms, solutions already advanced by other
scholars will be cited. The solutions to be proposed will not involve ALG.
Chapter 5
The Catalysts: The Triggers of Large-Scale Morphological
Change in Common Slavic Nominal Declension
So far we have touched on certain problematic forms in the earliest attested
declensional system of Slavic, and discussed various selected proposals for
handling them. In this chapter I show how certain phonological and phonetic
developments in the history of late Common Slavic might have contributed
to the morphological changes in the nominal declensional system, and to
show how certain forms might have developed as a result. The develop­
ments cited in 4 above are discussed afresh, from the point of view of how
well they fit into the piorphological analogy-based framework proposed in 3
above. Several forms which have not been accorded a great deal of discus­
sion in the literature (cf. 5.3.5 below), or not contrasted with the relevant
forms, are included, as juxtaposing them often sheds unexpected light on
certain problems. The directions and tendencies contained in the compre­
hensive “drift” proposed in 3.5 and 3.6 above as covering all EIE languages
will be commented on, insofar as they affect the respective forms chosen,
and it is argued that they can be made to fit into it very well.
5.1. Introduction
As mentioned above, the evolution of the phonological system of this stage
of Common Slavic was characterised by a set of several cumulative sound
changes, all tending towards rising sonority within the syllable. This had a
disproportionate effect on declensional and conjugational endings, many of
which, as we have seen above^ followed the pattern -V#, -VN#, -VC#, or
-VNC#; the development of -VN# and -VNC# to -V# and -VC# to -V#
would have caused a vast number of formerly distinctive endings to merge,
and the fusion of STEM VOWEL + DESINENCE combinations into single
unanalysable ENDINGS, resulting in syncretism on a massive scale, which
might have meant the end, or least considerable simplification, of the elabo­
rate systems of gender and case inherited from Indo-European. In many IE
languages this seems to be what actually happened, but Slavic, as is well
known, fundamentally remodelled its declensional system, and preserved
many of the distinctions lost elsewhere. Taken together, all these changes
132 Chapter 5. The Catalysts
might constitute the “special reasons” invoked by Mares 1963: 8 as neces­
sary for endings to be borrowed from one paradigm to another.
The proposed remodelling would also have implied the increasing con­
vergence of the categories of STEM-CLASS and GENDER in Slavic, thus re­
sulting in the above-average predictability of gender in the modem SI lan­
guages.1A further proposal is that this framework might make unnecessary
the reconstruction of the ALG normally proposed for Common Slavic.
In this chapter I concentrate on the effects of two developments in par­
ticular: the development of all -VN# combinations into -Y# (nasal vowels)
without exception, and the loss of final *-s, as I will argue that, taken to­
gether, they were the most important catalysts for the developments pro­
posed. It is very probable that these two changes happened very close in
time to each other; cf. Milewski 1932: 247, 250, 255;1
2 Shevelov 1964: 229,
328-29, 333, 633, VelSeva 1988: 51-67. According to the chronology
adopted here the loss of *-s is assumed to have happened after nasalisation,
but reversing the order would probably not alter the tentative conclusions
substantially. Other problematic forms, which on the one hand cannot be ig­
nored, but on the other cannot be easily seen as part of the tendency to pre­
serve distinctions, under threat from nasalisation and the loss of *-s, such as
the gen pi, will be treated in 6 below.3
At this stage we should recall, and repeat, Meillet 1914-15: 8’s caveat:
“II est etrange que, pour eviter d’admettre des traitements phonetiques qui
ne contredisent aucun traitement connu des memes phonemes places dans
les memes conditions, on ait recouru a des hypotheses analogiques qui sont
ou arbitraires ou invraisemblables, comme si les difficultes morphologiques
etaient, par nature, chose moins grave que les difficultes phonetiques” cited
1Cf. the relative ease of predicting gender from the nom sg (dictionary form) in the
modem SI languages, when compared to the complicated patterns in Germanic,
Latin, Greek, Celtic, etc., see, e.g., Meillet 1965: 380-81. There seems to have been
a somewhat similar trend in Baltic.
2Milewski dates the two developments to different epochs in his reconstruction, but
it appears that he would still date them close together in absolute terms; from his
table (1932: 255) it appears that they may have been separated in time by as little as
a century.
3Another sound change, the monophthongisation of *-i and *-u diphthongs, while
very important for the phonetic and phonological evolution of Common Slavic as a
whole, and contributing to the shift from THEMEVOWEL+ DESINENCE> ENDING,
does not seem to have had a great effect on declensional endings from the point of
view of triggering major analogical changes, and therefore will not be discussed in
this context.
5.1. Introduction 133
in 2.6 above. It will be argued that none of the proposals to be advanced are
“arbitraires ou invraisemblables”.
As shown above, most of the authorities accept the ALG (*-om > *-u;
*-ons > *-u (->’)) without apparent question. I have attempted to argue that
these ALG are in fact unnecessary for the reconstruction of the development
of CS1 nominal and verbal morphology, and will base the discussion below
in part on the reconstructive phonological and morphological/analogical
frameworks outlined in the previous sections.
The relevant endings will be discussed in pairs, and the proposed evolu­
tions will outlined in stages. They will be treated under the following head­
ings:

5.2. The Development of Nasal Vowels: The Effect on Common Slavic
Nominal Morphology
5.2.1. Introduction
Although the question of the evolution of nasal vowels in Common Slavic,
and the concomitant affect on the development of CS1 morphology, has been
discussed in detail for over a century with several ingenious hypotheses be­
ing advanced, no definitive solution has yet been proposed. In this context
Shevelov 1971a: 52 fn. 6 calls for a "... study which would take up each of
the categories involved for a thorough separate examination, undertaken,
however, against the broadest possible background of the phonemic and
morphological systems of the time, without mixing up phenomena which
belong to different epochs and without atomising the material.” An attempt
to partially answer the questions raised by Shevelov will be made below.
Problems in verbal morphology will be briefly discussed, but only insofar as
they are relevant to the framework proposed in this monograph.
5.2.2. The Acc Sg of the Masc *o- and *yo-Stems vs. the Acc Sg of the
Fern *a-and *ya-Stems

*vod-jd-m(*-ja-m) *zeml-ja-m
which developed to:
OCS gradu ‘town’ zenq ‘woman’
voz,di ‘leader’ zemljg ‘earth’
This group of endings has been the topic of much discussion in SI historical
phonology and morphology. Many scholars (e.g., Fortunatov 1897: 164 fn
1; Agrell 1913: 94; Milewski 1932; Shevelov 1964: 156-57, 224-25, 333;
Feinberg 1978; Vermeer 1991) have not treated them together, whereas
others (Leskien 1876: 60-63;4 Schmalstieg 1965: 238-39, 1968a, 1983a:
270-71, 1983b: 47) have, or at least included them in a larger picture. For
the purposes of the reconstructions proposed in this monograph, however, it
is essential to do so.
The first step is to establish a reconstructive evolution for these endings
in Common Slavic. Using the dialectal base proposed earlier, the following
scheme might be proposed:
4However, in his 1907 article Leskien ignores the fem *a-stem forms.

Stage II: Vowel Fronting After Ijl
*-a-m *-je-m *-a-m *-ja-m
Stage III: Nasalisation and the Loss of Final Is/
*-g *-j(i *-g *-jg
Stage III is a representation of what the subsystem depicted above might
have been, without any morphological/analogical changes. We can see,
however, that nasalisation and the concomitant loss of length distinctions
(see, e.g., Bethin 1998: 86), coupled with the loss of final *-s (see below for
a more detailed discnssion, also with regard to number), would have very
probably obliterated vital gender and number distinctions. The fusion of
THEME VOWEL + DESINENCE combinations into ENDINGS (see 3.2.3, 3.3
above, and 5.3.8, 6.1.1 below) would also have come into play at this stage,
probably accompanying both nasalisation and the loss of final *-s. If the
sub-system illustrated under Stage III had persisted, *-g could have denoted
masc acc sg, masc acc pi, fem acc sg, and fem acc pi for a large number of
substantives and adjectives in Common Slavic, possibly even a majority. 1
suggest that the drive to preserve the distinctions between fem acc sg and
masc sg on the one hand, and the sg/pl distinctions on the other, provided
the motive force in the changes that took place.
The ending *-g was generalised as a FEM ACC SG ending, while the
masc *8- and *jo-stems took the ending *-u from the *n-stems (> *-jt in the
*j<3-stems). The ending *-j<j was therefore eliminated from the masc acc sg,
and specialised as an ACC PL ending for the masc *j8- and fem *jd-stems, as
gender distinctions do not seem to have been nearly as important in the pi as
in the direct cases of the sg (see 3.5.1 above). Approaching the issue from
very different angles, Stankiewicz 1977 and Franks 1995: 53 both suggest
that the acc is the maximally unmarked case in Slavic (see 3.5.1). I would
push this state of affairs back to the CS1 period and to suggest that the drive
to preserve gender also affected the acc sg. None of these changes can be
fairly described as “arbitraires ou invraisemblables”.
136 Chapter 5. The Catalysts
At this stage we should justify the reconstruction of a long vowel in the
CS1 form of the acc sg. It was hinted above (2.4.5, 3 fn. 42) that some long
diphthongs were preserved for longer than others in Common Slavic. I sug­
gest that the fern acc sg ending of the *d-stems and *ya-stems would have
been one of these.
Originally this ending would probably have had a short vowel. The
length in the nom sg form *-a is from a laryngeal, i.e., a + H> *-a, see, e.g.,
Lehmann 1958: 192, Shevelov 1964: 62, and the acc would have been a + m
> *-am. Greek has variant forms, possibly pointing to the coexistence of
long and short stem-vowels at some period, e.g., 6 o |a 6 o |av ‘opinion’ acc
sg (< *-am), contrasted with Ttp,r| Ttp,f|v ‘honour’ acc sg (< *-am).
Nevertheless, in many IE languages the long vowel has spread from the nom
as a stem formant by the time of their first attestations.
When we consider that IE *o and *a merged in Slavic (there is, indeed,
no hard evidence that Slavic ever had an *o/a distinction), an argument in
favour of the preservation (or indeed, the (re-) introduction) of length in this
form appears. The length in the fem *a-stem form (*-am) would have
served to distinguish it from the masc *o-stem form (*-am (*-dm)), and
therefore this form may well have escaped the general shortening of long
diphthongs proposed as a BS1 development by Schmalstieg 1965: 238,
1968a, 1974b: 20-21, 309-10, 1976: 164-65; 1983a: 270, 1983b: 39. Later
on, when the distinction came under a fresh threat, this time from nasalisa­
tion and the concomitant merger of *-VN- and *-VrN- forms in *-y, the
morphological reshuffling referred to above would have taken place.
In the pi, however, the fem *ja-stems seem to show the reflex of a
SHORT vowel (-j% < *-jeNs < *-jaNs). The reason might be sought in the
fact that gender distinctions are generally less important in the pi than in the
sg (see 3.5.), and that therefore we might expect that the factors which were
conducive to the maintenance or reintroduction of length in the stem-vowel
in the sg were absent in the pi.

5.2.3. Summary and Conclusions
It therefore seems that nasalisation in Common Slavic did not, in fact, have
a very great effect on the development of the nominal declension system,
except by placing in jeopardy the distinctions between the acc sg of the Po­
sterns and the *d-stems and possibly the masc and neut nom sg of the *men-
stems (both of which were gender distinctions). As we shall see, the effect
of nasalisation was much less than the loss of *-s. This is contrast to the
relative amount of space usually devoted to both processes in discussions of
these developments in the scholarly literature, where nasalisation is ac­
corded a great deal of discussion, and *-s is dismissed in one or two lines, or
even omitted, cf. Leskien 1876: 13-23, 60-65; Schmalstieg 1983b: 39—
40,
44-48; Mikkola 1913: 72-77, 1942: 192-97; Furdal 1961: 40-41, 60-61,
62-63, 76-81 (nasals); Arumaa 1964: 113-14 (*-5), 115-17, 126-37
(nasals); even Shevelov 1964, who actually does discuss the phenomenon,
and hints at the loss of *-s having a great effect, only devotes pp 229-30 to
it, while devoting 224-26, 332-35 to the effect of nasalisation. Ferrell 1971:
90 does devote some discussion to the effect that the loss of final *-s would
have had on the forms that eventually became -c3, but does not pursue the
matter very far.
5Strictly speaking, the problem of -e3 also belongs here, but it will be treated in
5.3.7 below, as it can be best understood in that context.
138 Chapter 5. The Catalysts
5.3. The Loss of Final *-s and the Effect on Common Slavic Nominal
Morphology
In the Indo-European inflection system, as we saw in 3.4 above, *-s played a
very important role, as a marker of both number and case, and, as a general
rule, continued to do so well into the historically attested languages. A
glance at the tables given in 3.4 will confirm that it continues to do so, espe­
cially in modern Lithuanian and Latvian.6 Certain authors (e.g., Galabov
1973: 14; Lunt 1981: 17) even suggest that the range of *-s as a pi marker
was expanded in Common Slavic (e.g., CS1 *vlkoi > *vlkois > vluci
‘wolves’), and others, e.g., Mares 1962: 20 argue in favour of an expansion
in the C-stem nom sg (*kamon > *kamons > OCS karny ‘stone’).
In Common Slavic, however, *-s was lost everywhere in word-final po­
sition, as a result of the general tendency known as the Law of Open
Syllables. Usually, however, as we have seen, the loss of *-s in Common
Slavic seems to have been accorded far less discussion than the development
of *-VN# syllables. If one looks at the attested IE case systems given in 3.4
above, and tries to imagine how they would be affected by the loss of final
-s, it is quite clear that the changes would have been extensive.7Such a
development would seem to cry out for one of two solutions:
1) Reduction, or indeed, abandonment of the gender and case system,
and a shift to a more analytical structure, as has happened in lan­
guages such as, e.g., English, French, Danish, Welsh etc., outside
Slavic, or, within later Slavic, Bulgarian and Macedonian.
OR
2) Restructuring of the case system through morphological/analogical
change, as seems to have happened in Common Slavic.
In the CS1 nominal declensional system several forms would have been dis­
tinguished from other forms only by the presence or absence of *-s.
Therefore the loss of *-s would have meant the obliteration of several dis­
tinctions of number, gender, and case, without some form of restructuring
(see also Kuznecov 1961a: 155-58 for discussion from a slightly different
viewpoint). Here one can reconstruct far more potentially threatened mor­
phological minimal pairs than in the case of the nasals.
6And in Insular Scandinavian, in transmogrified form, *-s > -r.
7 See, e.g., Shevelov 1964: 229-30. Even when the loss of *-s is mentioned, the full
range of its ramifications is not discussed, cf. Feinberg 1978: 113, 115, 116).
5.3.1. The Nom/Acc Sg of the Neut *o-Stems 139
The reconstructed case endings are given in pairs. In each pair one form
will be marked by *-s, and the other by its absence. The *-s marks either
number, gender, or case, or some combination of these elements. Each pair
is accompanied by a short discussion on the ways in which the threatened
number/gender/case distinctions would have been saved under the frame­
work proposed here. In each pair the form originally without *--s is given on
the left, with the form where *-s was lost on the right.
5.3.1. The Nom/Acc Sg of the Neut *o-Stems vs. the Nom Sg of the
Masc *o-Stems
Original Forms:
CS1 *-o (*maisto) neut nom/acc sg *-os (*bogos) masc nom sg
Subsequent Development:
OCS mesto ‘place’ OCS bogu ‘god’
As discussed in 3.2.3 above, I reconstruct the neut *d-stem nom/acc sg as
*-o-0, following sevefal scholars, rather than as *-d-m or *-o-d. The over­
whelming advantage of this reconstruction is, of course, that it allows us to
derive -o in a direct phonological line from IE *-o, without any need for as­
suming the often-proposed analogy with the pronoun *to < *tod, or various
complicated ALG to explain a development *-6m > *-o, while elsewhere
*-dm > *-u.
Under this framework, the loss of *-s in the form on the right would
have caused the obliteration of the distinction between masc and neut in the
nom sg. As we saw in 2.4.2, 3.2.3, 3.5.1, above (see also 5.4, 6.2.5 below),
Common Slavic showed a very clear tendency to PRESERVE the neut, while
in many other IE languages, including East Baltic, the tendency was in the
direction of losing it. It should therefore come as no surprise that the lan­
guage developed in such a way as to save the masc/neut distinction. The *u-
stem ending *-u < *-us (*-ux) was introduced into the nom sg of the Po­
sterns as a distinctively MASC ending, and *-o was retained as a NEUT end­
ing, maintaining the distinction thus:
*-o(*maisto) *-u(*bogu)
It seems that we can make a fairly accurate proposal as to why -o, and not
-u, was generalised as a neut ending.
As a result of various losses of consonants in word-final position, -o had
become a neut ending in THREE categories:
140 Chapter 5. The Catalysts
a) *s-stem nom/acc sg, e.g., slovo ‘word’ <*-05
b) *o-stem nom/acc sg, e.g., mesto ‘place’ < *-o
c) the pronoun to < *tod ‘this’
The system would have undergone far too much disruption if -o had been
generalised as a masc ending. 8
It seems that here we have a clear case of the loss of * -s causing a
morphological realignment.
5.3.2. The Voc Sg of the Masc *yd-Stems vs. the Nom Sg of the Masc
*yo-Stems
Original Forms:
CS1 *-je *vodje ‘leader’ voc sg *-jes (< *-jos) (*vodjos) nom sg
Subsequent Development:
OCS vozdu vozdi
This is a fairly complicated problem, as the neut *jo-stem nom/acc. sg.
ending *-je-< *-jd- should also be considered. Ferrell 1965: 101-04 pro -
poses that the *#-stem voc sg ending -u was introduced into the masc * 6-
stem paradigm to preserve the distinction between nom and voc, which
would have been threatened by the loss of final * -s. While in basic agree­
ment with Ferrell on this point, I feel that a more important factor to be
taken into account is the possible need to distinguish the masc forms in the
nom sg from the neut forms. Following the order given above, the
proposed development would have proceeded as shown in Table 5-2 on the
page opposite.
The development postulated in (1) and (2) above would not have
extended over the whole of Slavic. Recent work has shown (see 4.4) that
the -e found as a nom sg ending in the earliest texts in North Russian,
whose origin is one of the most long-standing problems in SI linguistics,
must be integrated into any theory of the masc * o-stem nom sg.
8Vondrak 1898 proposes that the *-o was generalised as a neut ending under pres­
sure from the pronoun to < *tod and the *s-stems. Adding the bare-stem *-o to the
equation makes this case even stronger. See also Arumaa 1985: 131-32,
Koschmieder 1956: 239. Agrell 1913: 94 proposes a somewhat similar development
to the one being outlined here, but he does not (apart from a brief hint; cf. 1913: 42-
43 fn.2) attempt to integrate the development of the fern *a-stems into the overall
evolution.

Voc *-o *-e *-je *-ju (u < *-o-u)

As we saw in 4.2 there is a substantial literature devoted to the origin of this
-e, with proposals ranging from a survival from Indo-European (Ivanov
1985), special ALG (Zaliznjak 1988), a transfer from the voc (Sobolevskij
1907, with modifications by Vermeer 1991, 1994), and a transfer from the
*ji3-stems (Krysko 1993, 1994).
I suggest that a solution might be sought in a combination of Vermeer
and Krysko’s proposals. Both involve a transfer from the */o-stems fuelled
by a drive to preserve the distinction between the masc and neut, see 4.4.4
9Mares 1962: 20 suggests that the *w-stem ending was introduced in this category
in order to avoid homonymy with the neut *7<5-stem nom/acc sg in -je\ in this case
the catalyst would have been the fronting of *6 to *e/j -.
142 Chapter 5. The Catalysts
and 4.4.5. It appears that there may have been more than one factor favour­
ing the choice of -e as a distinctively masc sg ending in North Russian . As
we shall see below under the *men-stems (5.5), certain forms show diver­
gent developments within Slavic as a whole. In any case, however, it is
probable that the catalyst for the development, whatever its exact path, was
the loss of final *-s.

Here most scholars would seem to be in agreement: the loss of final *-s
would have caused a syncretism that simply remained (see, e.g., Shevelov
1964: 229).
This syncretism between nom and acc sg would have then been intro­
duced into the *<5- and *yo-stem mascs as well, as in 5-3.1. and 5.3.2. above
and 5.3.5. below. Later on, of course, a new MASC ANIM acc ending would
have been introduced into these paradigms: this development would have
followed the merger with the *w-stems.
5.3.4. The Acc Sg of the Masc *o-Stems vs. the Acc Sg of the Fern *a-

0The *«-stem and *i-stem developments are completely parallel. There may have
been a few neut *u- and *T-stems in Common Slavic at this stage; their absorption
into the masc */1-stems and the fern *i-stems respectively might also have been trig­
gered by the loss of *-s, cf. Szober 1927: 566, 6.3.2.

above.
5.3.4. The Acc Sg of the Masc *o-Stems 143
Subsequent Development:
OCS bogu bogy
OCS zeng zeny
This is one of the more controversial reconstructions. According to the tra­
ditional theory of ALG in Common Slavic as described in 2.1.4, *-dm
should have developed into *-u, and *-ons into -y (< *-«), thus allowing us
to consider the attested forms as the direct phonological descendants of the
reconstructed ones. However, it seems that if we accept that both of these
reconstructed endings would have fallen together as *-g after the rise of
nasal vowels and the loss of final *-s, we can set the stage for a plausible
morphological realignment.
The developments in the sg forms have already been considered from
the point of view of the development of nasals. Now let us consider them
from the point of view of the loss of final *-s.

A major morphological reanalysis led to the total restructuring of this
paradigm, making distinctions based on number, gender, and case, in that
order of precedence (see 3.5.1 above). As gender distinctions tended to be
kept distinct in the direct cases of the sg, and merged in the pi, THREE dis­
tinct endings would have been needed, to mark the following categories:
1) masc acc sg
2) fern acc sg
3) the acc pi ending for both genders
The restructuring probably proceeded as follows (see also 5.2.2 above):
1 44 C h a p te r 5. T h e C atalysts
The original *u-stem acc sg ending *-u was introduced into the *o-stem
paradigm as an exclusively MASC ending, while the fem *a-stems kept *-g
as an exclusively FEM ending. The *d-stem acc pi ending also took a dis­
tinctive ending from the *«-stems, i.e., -y (< *-u < *-us). This *-y then
spread to the *a-stem acc pi, e.g.,
*bogom > *bogg > OCS bogu ‘god’ acc sg (introduction of *-u from
the *u-stems)
*genam > *zeng > OCS zeng ‘woman’ acc sg
*bogons > *bogg > OCS bogy ‘god’ acc pi (introduction of *-y from
the *i/-stems)
*genans > *zeng > OCS zeny ‘woman’ acc pi
A similar solution was proposed by Georgiev (1969: 54). This analysis dif­
fers from Georgiev’s in that it reconstructs a sound-change *-dm > *-g in­
stead of *-om > *-o, and provides a more comprehensive overview. Here
again, it can be seen from the fragment just presented that problematic
forms in the reconstruction of CS1 morphology (in this case the masc *d-
stem acc sg, the fem *a-stem acc sg, and the masc *o-stem and fem *a-stem
acc pi) may be profitably viewed as the result of a realignment caused by the
loss of final *-s.
Actually, the *-y ending may well have extended its range even further,
to the 1st and 2nd person pi pronouns ny and vy. These may be recon­
structed as *nds ‘us’ and *vos ‘you’ (> CS1 *nas, *vas, see 2.4.6). The loss
of *-s, however, would have caused a merger with the respective dual forms
na, va, and the *-y ending, already on the march as an acc (nom/acc) pi end­
ing, may well have spread beyond nominal forms, to pronouns. Such a de­
velopment is not unparallelled; Meillet 1965: 451-52 suggests that personal
pronouns in Indo-European acquired their case forms in this way; although
he does not cite this particular example in this context.
5.3.5. The Acc Sg of the Masc * jo -Stems vs. the Acc PI of the Masc
*yo-Stems
Original forms:
CS1 *-fi (< *-jem < *-jdm) *vodjdm ‘leader’ acc sg

Subsequent Development:

This pair of forms should be treated separately from those in 5.3.1 and 5.3.4
because a slightly different method was used to remove the syncretism
caused by the loss of *-s. The acc sg would actually have been remodelled
after the *o-stems , which had introduced *-u (> *-?) from the *u-stems, as
in 5.3.1 and 5.3.4, but the *-j$ (< *-jens < *-jons) ending would probably
have been retained as an acc pi ending. In this case, in contrast to the situa­
tion with the masc *o-stem acc sg and pi, the *-j$ ending would have ap­
peared as an obvious acc pi ending, with no possible confusion with the fem
*ja-stem acc sg ending, which would have been *-jg. Moreover, the fem
*;a-stems would probably also have developed *-jq_ (< *-jans) in the acc pi,
thus lending this solution some further support.
The proposed development would have proceeded thus:
(*-8>*-e/j-) (nasalisation (morphological
and loss of *-s) reanalysis)
(jotation)
(theme vowel + desinence > ending)
Acc Sg *vodjom > *vodjem
Acc PI *vodjons > *vodjens

Viewing this problem from a mainly traditional standpoint, Ferrell (1965:
107) makes a similar proposal.

Original Forms:

Subsequent Development:

This group of forms should be treated together, as here we have both a
NUMBER and a CASE distinction that would have been eliminated by the
loss of final *-s. In this instance the distinction was restored by generalising
the acc pi endings, whether -y or -j$, onto the nom pi, and thence to the gen
sg. I reconstruct the nom sg ending as *-a, and the gen sg and nom pi end­
ings both as *-as, and, following Vaillant 1958: 150; Mares 1962: 17; I as­
sume that the attested gen sg endings -y (*a-stems) and -j$ (*ja-stems) are

from the acc pi ending in turn, e.g.,

(-j%generalised from the acc pi)
As we saw in 3.6, the nom pl/gen sg syncretism proposed for this relation­
ship is typologically very common in EIE languages. The acc pi is included
less commonly in this syncretism, but its occurrence is still regularly at­
tested. For further discussion, see 3.6 above.1

12Actually, in this case another distinction would have been threatened: that of the
neut and non-neut pi; see also 5.2.8 below.

clarity, see 2.1.8 above. The ceska prehlaska (see fn. 17 below) is a later phe­
nomenon.

Shevelov 1964: 633.

This is one of the earliest, and most important, morphological isoglosses in
Common Slavic. It actually belongs among the problems related to nasalisa­
tion, but as it can best be understood in conjunction with the issues dis­
cussed under 5.3.5 and 5.3.6 above, it is treated here. We will take the final
results from the above table as our starting point. As we saw in 4.5 and 4.6
above, numerous scholars have resorted to the reconstruction of all sorts of
special developments (special ALG with restricted application, sandhi, etc.)
to explain the occurrence of -e in certain forms in North Slavic (e.g., OR
Konb ‘horses’ acc pi, OPol konie id, OCz duse ‘souls’ acc pi < *-e) where
South Slavic (e.g., Old Church Slavonic) has -e, e.g., konjq_ ‘horses’ (see,
e.g., Shevelov 1964: 334-35; Kortlandt 1979: 258).
Newman 1971 points out that texts for most NSI languages are not actu­
ally attested until AFTER the SI nasal vowels reconstructed mainly on the
basis of Old Church Slavonic and Polish had been denasalised. Developing
Furdal 1961: 61 (see 4.6.2), he proposed that -e3 was introduced into the
*jo- and *ja-stems over most of North Slavic to save the distinctions be­
tween the nom sg on the one hand and the nom pi and acc sg on the other.
Differently from Furdal, however, Newman 1971: 334-38 proposes a
divergent evolution for Polish, fuelled by another potentially threatening
merger. Polish does preserve the CS1 nasal vowels in a somewhat altered
form; they all merge with regard to quality before the 14th century, with the
only distinction being length or the absence thereof (g vs. g, written 0 in
texts from the 14-15th centuries), which would have threatened a syn­
cretism between acc sg on the one hand and the nom/acc pi on the other. To
save this threatened distinction, -e3 was introduced into the *jd- and E a ­
sterns as the nearest non-nasal phoneme in the pi, while the nasal was kept
for the sg.1

16In Polish *-e would have been indistinguishable from *-e in word-final position at
the stage of the evolution of Slavic for which this development is proposed. The
term *-e3 is taken from its use in Cyrillic (£)■ In Russian *-e3was probably chosen

It will be noticed that, in this instance as well, the proposed morphological

ture the forms as they would have been in the tables above with final *-s in
the pi preserved, we can see that there would have been no need for a mor­
phological restructuring if *-s had been preserved:1

as “the nearest non-nasal phoneme” to the original front nasal because of its close­
ness in pronunciation to -ja (< *-^) and *-e. It is probable that in this instance the
development started in the *ja-stems and spread to the */o-stems.

Subsequent Development:

This analysis suggests a new approach to a much discussed problem in CS1
phonology and morphology: the reconstruction of the origin and develop­
ment of the attested masc *<5-stem nom pi ending -i. This ending is normally
derived from *-o-i (*-ai) on the basis of evidence from Latin, Greek, Baltic,
and Celtic. However, *-o-i (*-ai) normally develops to *-<? in Slavic, even in
word-final position in many instances, so any ALG proposed here would
have to be modified. As we have seen, many different, even diametrically
opposed solutions have been proposed.
The ending *-o-i"was pronominal in origin. Another ending, *-ds, can
be reconstructed for the masc *(5-stem nom pi, e.g., Go wulfos ‘wolves’, Skt
asvah ‘horses’ (< *-os), etc.
The masc dual forms should also be considered here. In Old Church
Slavonic the masc *<5-stem nom/acc du ending is attested as -a (< *-o), e.g.,
OCS vluka ‘wolves’, cognate with Greek -co, e.g., Xtjxoj id.
The attested paradigm might well have evolved thus:

b) a GENDER distinction: masc/neut pi1

18 Another possible merger might be considered here: the fern nom pi *-as would
have been simultaneously losing its final *-s, see 5.3.6. If we juxtapose this threat­
ened merger to the development under discussion here, we can visualise the almost
total loss of gender distinctions in the direct cases of the pi in the major subsystem
150 C h a p te r 5. T h e C atalysts
Evidence from elsewhere in the SI nominal system suggests that in this in­
stance (a) might have been less important than (b), the DU/PL distinction
being much less central than the SG/PL distinction, e.g., in the *w-stems the
loss of *-s would have resulted in syncretism between the ACC du and pi,
e.g., OCS (du) syny ‘sons’ < *siinu; (pi) syny ‘sons’ < *siinus. No morpho­
logical reanalysis seems to have taken place in this instance.
Nevertheless, the loss of distinction between masc and neut nom pi
could have been influential here. The tendency in Slavic to preserve the neut
as a separate class (see 2.4.2, 3.2.3, 3.5.1, 5.3.1, 5.4, 6.2.5) may well have
extended into the nom pi as well as the nom sg.
Therefore a new ending was introduced into the masc nom pi. Besides
the ending *-o-i, there seems to have been an ablaut variant *-ei, attested in
forms such as Lat servei ‘slaves’ (see Maziulis 1970: 174). Schmalstieg
1976: 150 quotes the OCS forms vluci ‘wolves’, dobri ‘good’, ti ‘these’ as
evidence for *-ei, together with Lithuanian forms such as geri ‘good’, tie
‘these/those’.
One important problem with reconstruction of *-ei is that *-ei would
normally have caused the FIRST Palatalisation of velars, e.g., Cz zito ‘rye’
(< *geito). Yet in forms such as OCS vluku ‘wolf’, bogu ‘god’, which have
stems ending a velar, the SECOND Palatalisation appears in the nom pi, e.g.,
vluci ‘wolves’, bo(d)zi ‘gods’. The proposal to be outlined below, which
utilises the framework of a morphological reanalysis’caused by the loss of
*-s, might offer one way of resolving this apparent contradiction.
The chronology given by Shevelov (1964: 633) suggests that *-s may
have been lost while the Second Palatalisation was productive. Therefore
any NEW front vowel (such as -e2 < *-ai/oi), or rather, any front vowel ap­
pearing in a new environment, would have caused the Second Palatalisation,
not the First. We can reconstruct the chronology thus:
*o-stem (loss of *-5) (introduction of *4 < *-jei)
masc nom pi *vlkas *vlkd OCS vlitci ‘wolves’
This reconstruction seems to avoid many of the difficulties usually associ­
ated with the origin of the masc *o-stem nom pi ending.1

represented by the *6- and *a-stems (nom pi masc/fem/neut would all have coa­
lesced in *-d; the acc would have preserved some gender distinctions).
19 The Second Palatalisation did not spread over the whole of Slavic; several NR
forms are attested without it.
5 .3 .8 . T h e N o m /A c c PI o f th e N e u t *o -S te m s 151
Given the widespread early penetration of the *w-stem forms, we might
ask why the *w-stem ending was not introduced into the masc nom pi ending
at this stage, in order to maintain the masc/neut gender distinction? The rel­
evant form, -ove, was certainly distinctive as a nom pi ending.
Within the framework of this analysis, I believe that the answer, or part
of the answer, lies in the realm of thematic vowel distinctions. As discussed
in 3.3 above, Andersen 1971: 953, Feinberg 1978: 110 suggest that thematic
vowel alternations lasted longer in Slavic than is commonly believed. With
the large-scale loss of final consonants, length distinctions in diphthongs,
and various other changes, THEME VOWEL/STEM FORMANT + DESIN­
ENCE20 combinations originally consisting of V + C (> V) may well have
reinterpreted as distinctive markers of number, gender, and case, e.g.,
Stems STEMFORMANT/
THEME VOWEL + DESINENCE
DISTINCTIVE NUMBER/
GENDER/CASE MARKER
*d-stem acc sg *-a- + *-m > *-Q
*a-stem loc sg ' *-d- + *-i > *-e
*w-stem acc pi *-ii- + *-s > *-u
*w-stem nom sg *-u- + *-s > *-u
*5-stem nom/acc sg *-os- + *-0 > *-o
However, certain other combinations were still analysable as THEME
VOWEL/STEM FORMANT + DESINENCE. Several disyllabic combinations;
e.g., the *w-stem nom pi ending -o-ve, had not been fused, and were still
immediately reanalysable as a STEM FORMANT + DESINENCE combina­
tion. The ending -o-ve may have been perceived as parallel to the C-stem
oblique forms, e.g •>
STEMFORMANT
THEME VOWEL + DESINENCE DESINENCE
*5-stem loc sg *-osl-es + *-i > *-es + i
*n-stem nom pi *-en- + *-es > *-en +e
*w-stem nom pi *-o-v- + *-es > *-o-v + e
Possibly it was for this reason that the -o-ve ending, still perceived as a
THEME VOWEL/STEM FORMANT + DESINENCE combination, was not
generalised as a distinctively masc nom pi ending at this stage. The pronom­
inal ending *-i was generalised instead, and as the Second Palatalisation was
20“Theme vowel” refers to e.g., the *-a- formant in the *a-stems, whereas “stem
formant” refers to, e.g., the *-os- formant in the *s-stems.
152 C h a p te r 5. T h e C atalysts
productive at this stage, it would have appeared in nouns with stems ending
in a velar. Later on, of course, with a further weakening of the concept of
THEME VOWEL + DESINENCE combinations, -o-ve did extend its range.
See also 6.1.1. for another instance of the emerging opacity of theme vowel
+ desinence combinations.
5.3.9. The Dat Sg of the Masc/Neut *d-Stems vs. the Instr PI of the
Masc/Neut *o-Stems
Original Forms
CS1 *-o-u *bogou ‘god’ dat sg *-o-us *bogous ‘gods’ instr pi
Subsequent Development:
OCS bogu bogy
This reconstruction is suggested by Feinberg (1978: 116), who proposes that
both of those endings, the origins of which are problematic in Slavic, should
be reconstructed with desinence initial *-u rather than *-i (i.e., *-oulous in­
stead of the oft-cited *-di/dis\ see also 4.8 above).
Feinberg sees a n o ~ « alternation as arising in CS1 nominal declension,
and proposes that it was used to save threatened distinctions (see 4.2.2
above). He would derive the dat sg ending directly from *-o-u (using his
proposed o alternant), whereas he would reconstruct the development in the
instr pi thus: *-o-us > *-o-u (loss of * - 5 ) > *-uu (*-u) (replacement of *-o-
by *-«-).
It is interesting to note that Feinberg seems to gloss over the use of *-s
as a PL marker, whereas it is precisely the use of *-s as a pi marker that most
of the forms discussed here involve.

the * u -Stems , *1-Stems, and C-Stems vs. the Gen Sg of the

5 .4 . S u m m a ry a nd C o n c lu s io n s 153
The loss of final *-s in forms (a) and (b) above would have caused a gen/loc
syncretism in the sg. As such a syncretism already existed in the du and pi
of many paradigms, both nominal and pronominal, there seems to have been
no need to introduce a new ending to save the distinction.
In fact, the C-stem loc sg form reconstructed under (c) above may well
have been introduced on the basis of a proportion with (a) (*-o-ust*-o-u >
*-us/*-u) and (b) (*-eis/*-ei > *-Ts/*-i) above, cf. *-es/*-X > *-es/*-e. See
Vaillant 1958: 184-85, Ferrell 1967, Kortlandt 1983: 187, and Orr 1984.2)
5.4. Summary and Conclusions
It appears that a large number of pairs of CS1 nominal forms would have
been distinguished from each only by the presence or absence of *-s. The
loss of this *-s would therefore have caused the obliteration of several num­
ber, gender, and case distinctions. Certain pairs were treated above in con­
junction with other pairs, because they can only be understood as part of a
wider framework. It seems to be fairly clear that the loss of *-s caused many
more far-reaching changes to the CS1 nominal declensional system than the
development of nasal vowels. As we have seen, this is in contrast to the
relative weight accorded to the two developments in the handbooks.
The loss of final *-s may be considered one of the main factors which
gave rise to the new, mixed *d/u- masc declension characteristic of most
modern SI languages, see Orr 1996, and Janda 1996: 83-174. At this point
we should recall that the *w-stems were numerous enough in Slavic for their
endings to play an important part in the formation of the new masc class that
arose in Slavic during the period of the disintegration of Common Slavic.
A COMPLETE LIST of reconstructed pairs of forms discussed is given
below. The forms on the left are reconstructed without original *-s, and the
forms on the right with it. Those in which the loss of *-s seem to have trig­
gered a morphological reanalysis are given in bold.
1) The acc sg of the masc *8- and *yo-stems vs. the acc sg of the fern *a-
and *ja-stems
2) The nom/acc sg of the neut *o-stems vs. the nom sg of the masc
*o-stems
21 The C-stem loc sg ending has often been explained by citing a postposition
*-en, cognate with Lith -e, e.g., vilke ‘wolf’ loc sg < *-en, for discussion see Hujer
1920: 72-73, Shevelov 1964: 224, 332. There is simply no need for such a recon­
struction. In any case, as discussed in 2.4.2, CS1 final *-en would have developed to

5) The acc sg of the masc *o-stems vs. the acc sg of the fem *a-stems

the fem * ( j ) a -stems
8) The nom sg of the fem pa-stems vs. the gen sg and nom/acc pi of
the fem pa-stems (NS1)
9) The nom/acc pi of the neut *o-stems vs. the nom pi of the masc *o-
stems
10) The dat sg of the masc/neut *d-stems vs. the instr pi of the masc/neut
*d-stems
11) The loc sg of the *w-stems , *I-stems, and C-stems vs. the gen sg of
the *w-stems, *t-stems, and C-stems
If these forms are taken together, it seems that a clear pattern is emerging.
As proposed in 3.5.1 above, NUMBER distinctions are paramount, and they
take precedence over gender and case distinctions: within the overall cate­
gory of number, the SG/PL distinction seems to be most important, and
whenever it was threatened by sound-changes, corrective morphological/
analogical changes took place to maintain it. The DU/PL distinction is much
less important: if it is lost through a sound-change, no attempts are made to
restore it. GENDER DISTINCTIONS are also maintained, especially in the
nom and acc sg and pi, although they are not as important as number dis­
tinctions. A tendency to preserve the neut in Slavic has been briefly noted
by many scholars (Jagic 1906: 118; Agrell 1913: 58; to some extent Meillet
1965: 380-81; Koschmieder 1956: 239; MareS 1962: 14-15; Feinberg 1978:
113, 117 fn.5; Krysko 1993: 131-32, 1994: 198-200. Kuznecov 1961a:
148-49 points out that Slavic distinguishes the masc and neut *o-stems
more than do other IE languages by differentiating both the nom and acc, as
opposed to just the nom). This may be seen as a relic of the situation in PIE,
where the neut forms in Slavic seem to have two distinctive endings in the
nom/acc: -o (-e) and -<
*, e.g., mesto ‘place’ (polje ‘field’), vrem$ ‘time’, tel%
‘calf, etc. It is also interesting to note the stability of the neut: when the
distinction between masc and neut is threatened, the neut will maintain the
old ending whereas the masc will introduce another one through analogy (cf.
5 .4 . S u m m a ry a nd C o n c lu s io n s 155
Nos. 2, 9 above, and under the *men-stems (5.5) below). Consequently, it
might also be noted that the neut *o-stems have shown themselves quite
stable within the evolution of the individual SI languages; if we compare
their paradigms in e.g., Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Czech, Serbo-
Croatian we can see a remarkable degree of uniformity, in contrast to the
massive changes undergone by the masc *o-stems, and their merger with the
*m-sterns, and the rise of the anim sub-gender. In this context it will be no­
ticed that none of the neut forms given in the table below actually undergo
any sort of morphological change. This state of affairs may be related to the
fact that the neut was probably more marked than the masc in Common
Slavic, and continues to be so: under Stankiewicz’s 1977 framework the
relative lack of marking in the masc allows more room for the expression of
other categories (e.g., esp. masc anim), whereas the greater degree of mark­
ing in the neut makes the development of further sub-genders in the neut
more difficult.22
CASE DISTINCTIONS seem to be even less important than gender dis­
tinctions: they are quite frequently lost altogether, especially if none of the
mergers mentioned above are involved; in fact, Nos. 4 and 11 above involve
the obliteration of case distinctions. This is close to the sort of evolution that
we might have expected from 3.5, 3.6 above, and therefore it is probably
fair to say that the proposals fit in very well with the general tendencies ob­
servable in the evolution of all EIE languages, with Slavic preserving far
more of the inflectional categories inherited from Indo-European, and pos­
sibly lying at one end of the continuum of development proposed above.
It might also be noted that, outside the area of purely nominal morphol­
ogy, the effect of the loss of *-s as a catalyst for far-reaching morphological
change in Common Slavic may also be glimpsed in the development of the
pres act part sf; as we will see in 6.2 below.
22Schupbach 1984: 20, 35-47 provides a brief history of the neut in Russian and
shows that in the modern language its position is much less secure than it would
have been in Common Slavic, documenting a steady decline in its frequency and
productivity since the 11th century. He hints that the neut may be on the way out as
a separate category in Russian, thus repeating much earlier processes in Baltic,
Celtic, and Romance. During the period covered by the developments being pro­
posed here, however, the neut would still have been a vigorous, productive cate­
gory. Furthermore, within Slavic as a whole, the neut might have evolved further in
the direction apparent from Baltic, Celtic, and Romance in some languages than in
others; Weiss 1993: 99-101 suggests that in Russian the neut has declined quite a
bit further than in Polish. See also Zuravlev 1974: 43; Slobin 1985: 1194.

As the proposed solution to the whole problem of the masc *u-stems,
the masc and neut *{j)6-stems, and the fem *(j)a-stems, taken together,
forms a large part of the morphological changes proposed here, they will be
given here in a single table. Within the table, the CS1 reflex of IE *d/a will
be rendered as &and the reflex of IE *o!a will be rendered as a, in order to
illustrate the proposed mergers and morphological reanalyses more clearly.
In order to approximate the forms actually attested, in the last part of the

5 .5 . T he *m e n -S te m s: A P ro b le m A rea 157
I suggest that the proposed developments as cited above explain all the
problematic forms in CS1 nominal declension under discussion. Nor do they
contradict Meillet 1914-15: 8 as cited in 2.6, 5.5: they involve common­
place phenomena, from the points of view of linguistic universals, the de­
velopment of Indo-European, and developments specific to Slavic (the gen­
eralisation of endings; restructurings to save distinctions; the identification
of particular endings with the categories of number and gender, etc.).
5.5. The * m e n -Stems: A Problem Area
Most of the examples discussed above have been relatively straightforward;
it has even been possible to set up pairs of contrasting forms, differing only
in one feature. Even e3, an oft-cited problem, has proved amenable to this
sort of analysis, and it has been shown that Newman’s 1971 proposal can be
incorporated into the framework utilised in this monograph and adapted to
it.
Not all forms, or groups of forms, however, are as amenable. One set of
forms which will require a great deal more discussion is the *men-stems,
which show the degree of uniformity among the neut nom/(acc) forms, e.g.,
OCS sem% ‘seed’ < *semen\ vrem$ ‘time’ < *uert-men, which may be con­
trasted with an almost bewildering variety of masc nom/acc forms, and
some possibly related fern forms. All sorts of factors have to be considered,
and it might almost be fair to say that almost every one of the standard ALG
proposed for the reconstruction of Common Slavic has been utilised in at­
tempts to explain the masc nom sg forms (see 4.9). In this set of examples,
therefore, the reconstructions will be much more complicated. The follow­
ing endings are attested for the masc nom sg *men-stems in the modem SI
languages:
a) -my, e.g.,
b) -mem, e.g.,
c) -my-ku, e.g.,
d) -mu, e.g.,
e) -mu-ku, e.g.,
f) -ma, e.g.,
OCS kamy ‘stone’
R KpeMeHb ‘flint’
Pol jqczmyk ‘barley’
Ka kam ‘stone’
Bg KaMtK ‘stone’
R xaMa ‘stone’.
OCS plamy ‘flame’
SC pramen ‘tuft’
Bg njiaMHK ‘flame’
R cTaM ‘support’
It seems that we will need not one, fairly straightforward reconstructive
morphological and phonological reanalysis, but several, if we are to attempt
to account for all the forms given above. Nor should the possibility of treat­
ing them as part of the vast group affected to a greater or lesser degree by
the loss of final *-s be ruled out; in Orr 1985: 28-29, 30 I did so, and I in­
158 C h a p te r 5. T he C atalysts
eluded them in a list similar to the one above, reconstructing the masc form
as, e.g., *kamens, contrasting with neut, e.g., *uertmeti. There already exists
a vast literature on the reconstruction of the history of these forms, stretch­
ing back to the middle of the last century.
The problem is compounded by the question of the IE ancestor: the CS1
*m<?«-stems are obviously related to the Gk forms in *-men-/-mon-, Lat
forms in -mol-min-, etc. Szemerenyi 1970: 157-64 discusses this issue, cit­
ing mainly material from Germanic. He cites a formidable amount of evi­
dence in support of reconstructing only *-oti, but there is some counter-evi­
dence, mainly from Baltic, which suggests that the *-eti forms were more
widespread in Indo-European than he would admit. Milewski 1932: 13 ad­
duces a masc form korq_ ‘root’< *-eti, which he relates to the oft-cited Gk
;toip,f|v ‘shepherd’.24 Kazlauskas 1968: 276-78 cites kor$, and also OCS
mladeriict ‘infant’ (*mVlden-), and goes on to discuss a set of Lith forms in
-e and -me, parallel to the better-known ones in -uo and -mud, e.g., sirsuo /
sirse ‘hornet’; lygmuo ‘image’/ lygme ‘plain’.
If we reconstruct the masc nom sg ending in this declension as *-men
(leaving aside for the moment the question of whether to reconstruct it as
*-mens), it would seem that the masc and neut forms would have been
distinguished from each other only by the feature of length. In fact, this may
well have been another instance of the preservation of length on originally
long diphthongs in order to maintain vital distinctions 'of number or gender.
With the development of both *VN and *-VN to *-V, the gender distinction
between masc and neut would have been in danger of vanishing in this stem-
class, and here no one single solution seems to have been adopted, but rather
the vital gender distinction seems to have been rescued by the introduction
of various distinctively masc, or in some cases, fern (non-neut) endings. It
should be borne in mind, however, that here it is the actual results of the
morphological/analogical reanalyses that pose the complications: the drive
to preserve gender distinctions can still be perceived. As with the *<5-stems
and *«-stems there have been some fluctuations in gender; OCS plamy
‘flame’; CSR haomh id < *-^; see Liewehr 1963: 874, 877.
Briefly, (b) above (*-mem) is the result of the generalisation of the acc
sg form, or possibly remodelling after the *?-stem pattern (thus unifying the
24Milewski and Kazlauskas cite kor% ‘root’ as ‘scs’ and ‘s.sl.’ [Old Church
Slavonic - RAO] respectively, but there is some doubt as to whether it is, strictly
speaking, an OCS form; Sadnik & Aitzetmiiller 1955: 46 cite it as “korenb m. (alter
n-Stamm) Wurzel”. Nandrij 1969: 69 describes it as “reconstructed on the basis of
corresponding OR forms”.
5 .5 . T he * m e n - Stem s: A P ro b le m A rea 159
paradigm under the single-stem *-men- and dropping the alternant), while
(d) (*-mu) is the result of the individual forms being transferred to the
emerging *d-/tl-stem declension, adding the highly productive *-k- suffix,
often associated with the *m
-stems, to produce (e) (*-muku).
The forms under (f) are the direct phonological descendants of the IE
forms in *-md, e.g., R kumo. ‘stone’ < *kamo. These forms have been noted
for over a century, cf. Buslaev 1875: 132, but have attracted relatively little
discussion, and their significance has often been belittled, or their very exis­
tence has been denied: see van Wijk 1925: 283; Milewski 1932: 4; G515bov
1973: 13, Arumaa 1985: 326.
The proposal being made for (a) (*-my) is more controversial, and
complicated: it is originally the fern *«-stem nom sg ending *-u (< *-us), in­
troduced into the *me«-stems to save the threatened distinction between
masc and neut in the nom sg which, as we have seen, would have been lost
if the normal phonological evolution had been allowed to run its course.
This proposal is similar to Georgiev’s (1969: 123) discussed in 4.9.5 above,
although, as in other'instances, Georgiev ignores a great deal of supporting
material, see also 4. fn. 11. The forms under (c) (*-myku) are, of course, the
result of the suffixing of *-k- to the forms under (a).
Three quite reasonable objections that might be raised to the above the­
ory can be expressed as follows:
1) Why should a FEM ending be used to rescue a MASC distinction?
2) The fern *u-stems were a small group in Common Slavic, and by
the time of the earliest records they had declined even further.
3) The fern *a-stem forms in *-a, e.g., R kumo. are probably not direct
phonological descendants of the reconstructed forms in *-o; no
paradigm nom sg *kama, acc sg *kameni, gen sg *kamene, etc., is
attested anywhere in Slavic, in contrast to what might be expected
if Kcma < *kamd.
One response that may be made to the first point is quite straightforward: if
the distinction between NON-NEUT (in this case MASC) and NEUT is the
one that attempts are being made to save, the adoption of a fern ending by a
masc form might seem quite reasonable under the circumstances. This pro­
cess may be a result of the above-noted tendency to preserve the neut in
Slavic, which has lasted longer than in nearly all other IE languages, and
may be considered a vestige of the old anim/inanim contrast that we may
reconstruct for PIE; see also 3.1, 3.2.3, 3.3 above and Krysko 1994 loc. cit.
It will be recalled that the masc/fem distinction developed out of the split of
160 C h a p te r 5. T he C atalysts
the old PIE anim class (see also Mares loc. cit.)- The development recon­
structed here, therefore, may be seen as another manifestation of the ten­
dency to preserve the neut. It may be further strengthened by the fact that in
this case, too, the neut is PRESERVING the old ending while the masc is in­
novating, as we saw above with the *d- stems. It should also be noted that
there were no fem *men-stems in Common Slavic.
Although at first sight the fem *w-stems seem to have been few in num­
ber in Slavic, their numbers were augmented by two factors, which may
have fed each other: 1) the development of an embryonic “feminine virile
subgender”, mainly centred round the *w-stems (e.g., OCS jqtry ‘woman’s
sister-in-law, husband’s brother’s wife’, see Abernathy 1979),25 2) an influx
of borrowings from Gmc *<5- (< *a-) stems (see 2 fn. 4), e.g., CGmc *bdkd
‘letter’ > CS1 *buky\ Go smakka ‘figs’ > CS1 *smoky, Gmc *kirikd > CS1
*clrky ‘church’. This was undoubtedly one of the factors which fuelled a
burst of productivity in the *w-stems in Common Slavic, which has been
noted by several scholars; Hujer 1920: 76; Knutsson 1929: 4-5, 25, 27-28
passim,26 Kuznecov 1961b: 55; Bemstejn 1974: 221, 223, 240 mentions a
“certain degree of productivity on the part of the -y (-t>
v) stems”, and sug­
gests that this productivity was in full swing between the 4th and 12th cen­
turies, parallel to the bursts of productivity shown by the *s-stems; echoed
by Arumaa 1985: 63: “Das Slavische gestattet uns hier sogar von einer
gewissen Produktivitat zu sprechen” (63-68). This'point is apparently
overlooked by Jasanoff 1986: 183, who simply dismisses the *w-stems as
“unproductive”.
Nor is it entirely clear that the CS1 *-w-stems were all fem. The form
*Mzyku, appears to have been formed in the same way as Pol jqczmyk
‘barley’, Bg njiaMUK ‘flame’, etc., cited above (< *-my-ku), and may be re­
constructed as < *inzii-kii (< *(d)nghu -, cf. OE tunga ‘tongue’, Lat dingua
id (> lingua)), OIr tenge id; all fem, however Lith liezuvis id; OPr insuwis
25 Abernathy 1979: 7 puts it thus: “It accordingly becomes a legitimate question
why the relatively minor class of ii-stems, which might have been expected to fade
quietly from the scene (as in the longer run, it did) early in the process of reorgani­
sation of Indo-European declension in Slavic... instead succeeded for a time in
holding its own and even getting its share of the lexical ‘booty’ which became
available by reassignment of stems as the older system broke down”.
26A further factor in the adaptation of Gmc loanwords, as noted by Knutsson, may
have been the relative closeness of Ger [o:] to later SI *-y, cf. Russian Church
Slavonic njiocKbi ‘vessel’ < OHG *flasca ‘bottle’ (1929: 38-39). See also Stender-
Petersen 1930: 250-55 for further discussion.

id, its closest IE cognates, are both masc; see also Georgiev 1969: 123;
Arumaa 1985: 66 for some more possible examples.
Furthermore, both the *men-stems and *w-stems in Common Slavic
were C-stems, and their declensional patterns were very similar in the sg
outside the direct cases, which may have provided support in the eventual
choice of *-w > -y as one possible nom sg ending for the masc *men-stems;
see Liewehr 1963.
The third point is raised explicitly by Jasanoff 1986: 183. It may be par­
tially answered by citing a similar form, which has also wholly shifted from
the C-stems to the *<5-stems in Common Slavic: voda, generally recon­
structed as < *uodo(r) (see, e.g., Hujer 1920: 42^-3 fn.; the PIE form may
be reconstructed as an *-n/r-stem, cf. Hittite watar ‘water’, gen sg wetenas',
Gk iibcoQ id gen sg ii&on;o<;; Go watd id, gen sg watins, contrasted with Eng
water, or alternatively, an NIE *n-stem form: Lith vandud ‘water’ (< *-o)
gen sg vandens; etc. From the earliest attestations, however, voda ‘water’
has always been declined as an *a-stem in Slavic, without any paradigm
with nom sg *voda‘
, acc sg *voderii, gen sg *vodene, etc. being attested
anywhere - exactly what we find, or do not find, in the case of *kama -
*kamem, etc., as cited by Jasanoff, with the difference that the shift of voda
to the *a-stems has been complete: no form *vody is attested as a nom sg.
Albeit while casting doubt on the comparison of voda and Lith vandud
(“nicht sicher genug”), Zubaty 1893: 502-03 cites another possible example
of such a paradigm: Common Slavic *strxa ‘hornet’(< *sirxo, also sirxy,
*sirsa) - gen sg sirsene, cf. Lith sirsuo - sirseiis, also Sirse, see above, R
uiepiueub id.27 It may be proposed that, in contrast to the *men-stems,
however, there were very few *n/r-stems in Common Slavic, and that
therefore they have left far fewer traces than the much more numerous
*men-stems.28
In any case, historical linguistics can show examples where marginal
endings, or endings which have become marginalised, can sometimes spread
all over, or beyond, their respective paradigms, or can even take on new
functions; in isolated cases this spread might be described as a “rebound”,
21Bemstejn 1974: 165-66 seems to be urging caution; see also Meillet 1905: 418,
432, who sees this form as a possible old *-n/r-stem, citing forms such as SC srsljen
‘homet’(-l- < *-r- by dissimilation), Lat crabro ‘hornet’.
28 Ironically, it might be noted here that kamy ‘stone’, nearly always used as the
masc *men-stem citation form in Slavic, may also have been an *n/r-stem in
Common Slavic, cf. Truba£ev 1974: 9: 137; also Ole himinn ‘heaven’, but hamarr
‘hammer, cliff’; Skt asmara- ‘stony’.
162 C h a p te r 5. T he C atalysts
where forms go through a period of decline, followed by a period of pro­
ductivity. One of the best examples of this phenomenon is in fact the SI 1st
person sg ending -m, see Janda 1994, 1996: 9-81. Another, less well-known,
SI example is provided by the various bursts of productivity undergone by
the *5-stems (see also 4 fn. 6) in different parts of Slavic.29
Again, in conclusion Meillet 1914-15: 8 may be recalled here, and the
question might be spelt out (especially as it was in a critique of an earlier,
less developed, version of this proposal (Orr 1986) that it was cited by
Kortlandt 1986: 184): Can this proposal fairly be described as a “hypothese
analogique .... ou arbitraire ou invraisemblable”?
I would suggest that the response to this question in this context should
on balance be “no”, although less categorically than the examples cited
above. Parallel to these examples, the neut has maintained the original end­
ing, and the masc has innovated. The problem of the *men-stems, therefore,
can be made to comfortably fit into the proposed framework.
29Several scholars would probably see the spread of the *w-stem endings in Slavic
as another, indeed, canonical, example of this phenomenon, and, in the light of sev­
eral of the arguments advanced in this monograph, might express surprise that it is
not being mentioned in this context. In this case, however, the proposal of the
spread of an originally marginal set of forms is not necessary; one should rather
think of a merger of two fairly numerous classes, see Orr 1996.
Chapter 6
Other Problematic Forms
This chapter will be devoted to discussing further possible supporting evi­
dence for the ALG *-om > *-u and *-ons > *-y. It will include other evi­
dence from nominal morphology not discussed above, pronominal morphol­
ogy, verbal morphology, and isolated forms, and a discussion of how this
evidence might fit into the proposed framework, while continuing to use
Meillet 1914-15: 8 as a check, see 2.6. The forms are as follows:
6. 1. * - 6 m > * -u
6.1.1. The Genitive.Plural
This form is usually cited as one of the best pieces of evidence for a sound-
change *-8m > *-u in Common Slavic. At first sight it seems to be the
strongest—it is more morphologically isolated than the others, and, one
might think, slightly less prone to analogical pressures from elsewhere in the
paradigm. Therefore it is being handled here, rather in 5. Most of the
scholarly discussion has centred on whether the original ending should be
reconstructed as *-dm or *-om in Common Slavic, with those scholars opt­
ing for *-dm as the original ending forming various hypotheses to account
for an early shortening of *-dm to *-dm, with *-dm > *-u subsequently
kicking in. At first sight the IE evidence is surprisingly uniform: Greek and
Sanskrit both seem to point to *-dm, e.g., Gk Xinttov ‘wolves’ gen pi, Skt
vrkanam—id, while Latin and Old Irish seem to show *-8m. There is a vast
literature on the topic, and, if one were to be forced to choose between these
two forms; the balance would probably favour *-dm (see, e.g., Mikkola
1913: 74, 1950: 31; Milewski 1932: 18; Vaillant 1935, 1958: 35-36;

142-44; Moszynski 1984: 224, Arumaa 1985: 128-29).'
Nevertheless, there still remain a few problems.
Reconstructing a single ending for Baltic and Germanic is a little more
complicated, as both groups show competing variants: for Baltic, Lithuanian
shows a reflex of *-om (vardu ‘names’); whereas Old Prussian is compli­
cated. It does appear to show a reflex of *-dm (grikan ‘sins’); recently it has
been suggested that Old Prussian actually underwent some degree of de-
nasalisation, and that the *-n attested in various declensional endings, in­
cluding the gen pi, may be the result of Ger influence (see Smoczynski
1992: 58-71). The situation in Germanic is complicated as well: most of the
older languages allow us to reconstruct *-om, but in Gothic the mysterious
and oft-discussed -e ending (dage ‘days’) causes several difficulties.1
2
Armenian, Tocharian and Hittite also have divergent endings, e.g.,
Armenian har-c ‘questions, enquiries’ < *-sko
Tocharian ydkwe-mts ‘horses’ < *-n-s
Hittite antuhs-aS ‘men’ < *-os3
One point that has come in for some scrutiny is that the gen pi forms of
the *6- and *<5-stems in Slavic seem to have lost the theme vowel, e.g., OCS
gradu ‘towns’ < *gVrd-om (*gVrd-o-oml); OCS zetiu ‘women’ < *gen-om
{*gen-a-oml). What has happened to the theme vowel? Would *-om have
1For this form, MikloSiC 1876: 8 seems to be hinting at a solution similar to the
ones discussed in 2.4.3: “... pi. gen. Das urspriingliche suffix am ist in 9 und dieses
in folge fortschreitender schwachung in r> tibergegangen, wie in der proposition
aind. [Sanskrit - RAO] sam. asl. [OCS - RAO] S9, si.: imern., slovest.
2There is a vast literature on the Go gen pi. Must 1952 provides a review of dis­
cussion up to that date. Since then Krause 1963: 89, 140; Kortlandt 1978: 291-93;
Shields 1979; d’Alquen 1988: 227 (see below), have also proposed their own solu­
tions.
It is possible that for our purposes the Go forms may be a red herring, as sev­
eral of the solutions involve postulating special developments within Gmc. How­
ever, they do show that not all IE gen pi forms can be simply traced back to *-dm or
*-dm.
3 Coexisting with an ending -an, see SavCenko 1968: 24-25. Almost as an aside,
Lunt 1981: 17, for reasons that are not entirely clear, proposes a gen pi ending in
*-as for Common Slavic as a “possible late replacement for -aN <*-dm.”
6 .1 .1 . T h e G e n itiv e P lural 165
been suffixed directly to the root? See also Kuznecov 1961b: 72-73 for dis­
cussion.
These questions are posed by Vaillant 1935: 7, who states that that
question should be answered in the affirmative, but he starts off from the as­
sumption that “ ... une desinence -u ... ne peut repondre qu’a i.e. *-on." He
points out that OCS, and later Slavic, preserves several traces of an older
construction, which can be seen in the use of an adjectival construction to
translate Gk genitives, e.g., OCS sytiu boziji ‘son God-adj’, cf. Gk mog xou
ffeou ‘the son of God’ and cites a parallel from Armenian: noyean tapan
‘Noah-adj Ark’, for “Noah’s Ark”, cf. R Hoee icoenez id. He then goes on to
say, however (1935: 8), that the gen pi itself may be derived from an origi­
nal neut nom/acc sg form, citing some examples from Greek.
Ivanov and Toporov 1961: 289 suggested that the gen pi was originally
not subject to the sg/pl contrast, partially echoing Hirt 1927: 3: 60, who note
that the gen was the only case in the pi where *-s was not attested.
Shields 1979, 1981, 1982a amasses a great deal of evidence pointing to
the existence of deictic particles *-i, *-u in IE, some of the uses of which
included input into what later became case endings; he uses a combination
of these particles as an explanation for the Go gen pi -e discussed above.
These combined with theme vowels and other case formants. According to
Shields, this is one of the possible ways of explaining the gen pi ending
*-o-s-i-o reconstructed on the basis of Gk (Ciutou ‘horse’ gen sg (< -oio <
*-os-io)) and Skt (vrkasya ‘wolf’ gen sg (< *-os-io)). In IE both particles are
sometimes attested in what are otherwise identical forms, e.g., Homeric Gk
xoioi ‘the’ dat pi, contrasted with OCS texu ‘these’ loc pi,4 even within sin­
gle IE families (OCS beretu ‘s/he takes’, contrasted with OR 6epemb id, cf.
Skt bharati ‘s/he bears’).5The *u particle seems to have had many functions
within IE; in Slavic it often appears with gen forms, OCS gen/loc du gradu
‘towns’ < *-o-k; gen/loc pi texu (< *to-i-s-u), (acc)/gen/loc pi nasu ‘us’ (<
*-u). Vaillant 1935: 9 juxtaposes OCS texu to related forms such as nasii,
vasu ‘you’ (acc)/gen/loc pi, which he would derive from *nds-on, *uds-on,
hinting, that texu is to be derived from *tois-on (*-om).6 It is much more
likely, however, that it is to be derived from *toisu\ the *-su ending finds
obvious cognates in Sanskrit (kantesu ‘beloved’ loc pi < *oi-s-u) and older
4 For discussion of the apparent discrepancy in case, see Maziulis 1970: 218-28,
334-35.
5 See also Miller 1988.
6 Schelesniker 1964: 31-32 would also derive this *-u from *-8m.
166 C h a p te r 6. O th e r P ro b le m a tic Form s
Lithuanian (Old and dialectal Lith -su, e.g., dangusu ‘skies, heavens’ loc pi;
Modem Lith -se, e.g., danguse id).
Positing *-u instead of *-dm in this position might also explain why the
Third Palatalisation seems to have been blocked in such forms (i.e., why not
*toisom > *toixom > *tesi), see also 6.1.3.
In previous work I glossed over the question of whether *-dm EVER
served as a gen pi ending in SI, and proposed that the gen pi ending *-«,
which can be reconstructed with certainty for CS1, could be derived directly
from PIE *-«, see Orr 1986, 1988. At this point I would like to discuss pos­
sible paths of development if in fact the original CS1 gen pi ending had been
*-om.
Again, nasalisation and the loss of *-s might have had a role to play. As
we have seen, in the *6- and *a-stems the ace sg endings (*-dm, *-am) and
ace pi endings (*-ons, *-ans) would have all fallen together in *-p. Possibly
the specialisation of *-q as a fern ace sg ending affected the gen pi as well;
the gen pi might have had to introduce a new ending in order to maintain its
distinctiveness and the gen/loc *-u ending, which had shown some tendency
to extend its range in Slavic, may have been suffixed to the bare stem as a
gen pi marker. Later on, of course, the *-u ending was dropped as part of the
process of the fall of the weak jers, and was largely replaced by other end­
ings as they were introduced into the gen pi.
I suggest, therefore, that the SI gen pi in fact derives from the affixation
of the particle *-u directly to the root.
The absence of any apparent trace of the theme vowels in the *o- and
*d-stems, cited by Vaillant 1935: 7; may be explained as follows: with the
large-scale loss of final consonants, length distinctions in diphthongs, and
certain other changes, certain THEME VOWEL + DESINENCE combinations
could well have been interpreted as distinctive markers of number, gender,
and case, e.g., the masc. nom. sg. *w-stem ending *«< *-« (thematic vowel)
+ *-s (desinence), see also 3.3, 5.3.8. As the theme vowel + desinence
combinations became more and more opaque, it is possible that forms such
as sloves+u, synov+u, mater+u,1 etc., may have served as models for forms
such as *gVrd+u, and *zen+u, which in turn would have replaced any forms
which included the thematic vowel. This morphological extension would
have taken place a little earlier than the one outlined in 5.3.8, where it was7
7 Some speakers may even have interpreted such forms as slov+es+u, syn+ov+u,
mat+er+ii
6 .1 .2 . T he First S in g u la r P ro n o un 167
proposed that thematic vowels were kept distinct from desinences during
most of the developments outlined.
6.1.2. The First Singular Pronoun
The form azu ‘I’, attested in Old Church Slavonic, along with related forms,
can be adduced as an example of *-om > *-u in Common Slavic, cf.,
Milewski 1932: 18; Shevelov 1964: 224, Cekman 1979: 137. Elsewhere in
Slavic it appears with an initial j- (e.g., Macedonian jac ‘I’), or without the
final *-zu (Russian a, etc.). The form ja is usually explained as a reduced
form of (J)azu. Skt aham ‘I’ and Avestan azsm id are usually cited as cog­
nates in this context, thus, apparently, providing us with yet another example
of *-om > *-w. Lat ego ‘I’ and Gk eyd) id, however, show forms which
might best be explained by reconstructing *-d or *-dm, thus providing us
with a partial parallel to the situation we find in the gen pi (see above).
Hamp 1983, however, argues quite convincingly that ja can be traced
directly to IE *eg, as reflected in both Baltic (Lith as T ) and Germanic (Go
ik id), with a Slavic loss of final *-g. He suggests that the form attested as
(jjazu may be explained as the result of borrowing from Iranian (1983: 12-
13), due to the “important and intimate relations between Slavs and Iranian
speakers ... over a considerable time period”. I would go on to say that it is
possible that the ancestor of (j)azu was borrowed AND REBORROWED dur­
ing such a symbiosis, see also Abaev 1971: 11, Orr 1988: 58. Such borrow­
ing and reborrowing has taken place elsewhere in the history of Slavic.
Shevelov 1964: 160-61 cites the example of Romanian loanwords into
Common Slavic, where
“... on the basis of what we know from history we should expect
SI loan words in Rm [Romanian—RAO] since the sixth century:
but the SI loan words found in Rm as a rule have the SI form of
the ninth or tenth century at the earliest... Many SI words in Rm
appearing as tenth-century words were borrowed much earlier,
but their SI phonetic development was not arrested due to bor­
rowing.”
The problem of determining whether such borrowing took place be­
tween Slavic and Iranian is rendered far more difficult by the fact that geo­
graphically the nearest Iranian language to Slavic is Ossetian, which is sepa­
rated from the usually-proposed original homelands of the Slavs by great
distances, and has undergone a great deal of evolution in its own right.
Indeed, perhaps the final *-w attested in (jjazu reflects a development in
168 C h a p te r 6. O th e r P ro b le m a tic Form s
Iranian, rather than in Slavic: it might be noted that the Iranian forms cited
by Hamp as possible sources of Slavic (f)azu (Ossetian cez ‘I’, Kurdish az(a)
id) show that some form of evolution has taken place there als well.
At first sight it might seem incredible that a 1st person pronoun might
be borrowed. Such a borrowing is not, however, absolutely unparallelled:
the Western Desert language of Australia is attested as borrowing the 1st sg
pronoun from English for reasons of taboo (see Dixon 1980: 28-29), and
there is also, of course, the well-known instance where the 3rd pi pronouns
in English were borrowed from Scandinavian to prevent homonymy.8
As with so many of the other forms discussed in this monograph, the
same reason—the prevention of a threatened homonymy—might be pro­
posed for Slavic if we accept Hamp’s proposal that SI (j)azu is a borrowing
from Iranian. As we have seen, the loss of final consonants in Common
Slavic caused far-reaching morphological changes, mostly aimed at rescuing
the inflectional system. The loss of the final velar in *eg might have pro­
duced a form which could have been confused with the fern. 3rd person nom
sg form *ja or the neut. *je, depending on whether length is reconstructed —
a point glossed over by Hamp.
The reanalysis tentatively being proposed here, of course, is much less
clear-cut than some of the ones we have seen above. The form (j)azu has a
restricted distribution on Slavic territory: cf. Bg a3 ‘I’, Macedonian jac id.
Hock 1991: 162, in a general, albeit brief, discussion of the development
of the “Law of the Open Syllables” in Common Slavic, views the problem
from another angle, first broached by Schleicher loc. cit., suggesting that the
final *-u in OCS azu might be the result of word-final anaptyxis—the devel­
opment of an extra vowel to preserve a final consonant threatened by loss.
He does not pursue this idea, and few other scholars have mentioned it (see
2.5.5).
All these special problems, however, boil down to the fact that the 1st sg
pronoun provides a much less clear instance of *-dm > *-w than many of the
forms cited. In the absence of more unequivocal evidence, therefore, we
should not cite OCS (j)azu as an example of *-om > *-u.
8On another level, the use of Fr moi ‘me’ in English by certain speakers on certain
occasions (cf. Miss Piggy in “The Muppets” when accused of some minor malfea­
sance!) might be seen as an other example of this phenomenon.
6 .1 .3 . T h e First S in g u la r o f th e A o ris t 169
6.1.3. The First Singular of the Aorist
Again, as we have seen, this ending is nearly always accepted without ques­
tion as an instance of IE *-om > CS1 *-u. It appears in both asigmatic (OCS
mogu ‘I was able to’) and sigmatic (OCS vesu ‘I led’) aorists, and can also
be found in the imperfect (OCS neseaxu ‘I carried’). This reconstruction is
primarily based on data from Greek, which has numerous “strong”
(asigmatic) aorists ending in *-om (> -ov) in the 1st sg, e.g., eka|3ov ‘I took’
aor (kapPdvm); ecpuyov ‘I fled’ aor (cpetr/oo), etc. In Sanskrit the evidence is
more ambiguous, although there is nothing to hinder the reconstruction of
*-dm (> -am). Evidence from other IE languages in this case is surprisingly
scanty, and perhaps it is a little odd that this form is almost universally ac­
cepted as a canonical example of *-dm > *-u when the support that it re­
ceives from other IE languages is far less by comparison to other forms dis­
cussed above.
Moreover, it is by no means clear that the Slavic ending is to be linked
with the Gk and Skt forms given above in the first place. The Gk sigmatic
aorists have the 1st sg ending -a (< *-m), e.g., eyQarpa ‘I wrote’ aor (< *e-
grabh-s-m), and the Skt -am ending mentioned above could also be of that
origin. It was proposed by Liidtke 1966: 132 that Slavic *-u is in fact the
reflex of IE *-m, and therefore closer to the Gk sigmatic aorists rather than
the asigmatics. According to this theory, the development would have run
thus: *mogm > *mogum > *mogit.
According to the framework utilised in this monograph, however, both
CS1 *-6m and *-um should have developed to *-p, which, however, we only
find as 3RD PL ending, e.g., mogg < *mogont. There is, however, another
ending which deserves closer scrutiny than it has been accorded. Several IE
languages show 1st sg past endings in -u rather than *-om, e.g., Skt tasthau
‘I have stood’;9 Lith buvau ‘I was’; Go nimau ‘I trust (subjunctive)’;
Tocharian lakau ‘I see’, Hittite u-uh-hu-u-u(n) ‘I saw’, etc.
In addition, in Latin many perfect forms have a -v- (-u-) throughout the
conjugation, e.g., amavi ‘I loved’; cognovi ‘I knew'\audivi ‘I heard’; monui
‘I warned’. Van Windekens 1975: 431 attempts to link these forms with the
Luwian 1st sg ending *-ui, arguing that PIE could have had *-ui and *-mi
alternating in the 1st sg.1

9This form can also have 3rd person meaning in Sanskrit.

0Erhart 1970: 17 points to several cases where PIE *-m- alternates with PIE
and proposes that these be subsumed under one phoneme, which he labels M2. I
myself, while in broad agreement with Erhart, would prefer to see this alternation as
170 C h a p te r 6. O th e r P ro b le m a tic Form s
Schmalstieg 1975: 173 refers to this -u form and says:
“It is usually accepted WITHOUT QUESTION [emphasis mine -
RAO] that the Slavic 1st. sing, aorist ending *-u derives from
*-oN [Schmalstieg’s notation for *-dm - RAO], but in practice
there is no reason why it should not come directly from IE *-u,
and indeed, be compared with the Hittite preterite ending *-u-n.
If this is the case, then in Slavic the contrast between the 1st.
sing. pres, ending *-oN (> *-p), and the first singular preterite
ending *-u has existed since IE times.”
As far as I aware, no other scholar has drawn attention to this possibil­
ity. I would go further than Schmalstieg, however, and suggest that this re­
construction is to be preferred.
This reconstruction might also answer an objection by Lunt 1989: 37-
38 fn. 6, who proposes that the Third Palatalisation did not apply to CS1
*-x-, citing “aorists of the type molixrb” as an example. Proceeding from the
theory outlined here, however, an ending in *-u would have blocked the
Third Palatalisation in any case, and therefore this example may not be the
most felicitous for Lunt’s theory, as with the gen/loc forms in *-u, see
above.
Therefore I derive OCS mogu directly from *mogu, and propose that
this ending also appears in the sigmatic aorist (neso'xu) and the imperfect
more probably arising from a very old sound-change *VmV > *VvV/*VwV (the exact
phonetics need not concern us here), similar to the m/w alternation found in Irish,
e.g., mathair [ma:hir’] ‘mother’, mo mhathair [ms wa:hir’] ‘my mother’. A similar
sound-change can be reconstructed in the history of Hungarian, e.g., nev < Finno-
Ugric *nime ‘name’.
The exact origins of this sound-change are buried too far back in time for us to
reconstruct them as exactly as we seem to be able to do in other cases, but it does
seem to be attested all over IE in 1st person pronouns and verbal desinences, as well
as in word-formation and various puzzling forms. We can find examples without
even going outside Slavic, e.g.,
OCS nom/acc du ve(*-w-)‘we two’ nom pi my{*-m-) ‘we’
lstdu neieve(*-w-)‘we two carry’ 1st pi nesemu(*-m-) ‘we carry’
There are also SI forms such as cirvi ‘worm’, p'trvu ‘first’, where other IE languages
have *-m-, cf. Lat primus ‘first’.
6 .1 .4 . T h e First P lu ra l o f V erbs 171
(neseaxu), thus obviating the need to reconstruct an ALG *-dm > *-u in this
instance as well.1
1
6.1.4. The First Plural of Verbs
Although in this instance the reconstruction of *-dm > *-u is used here
only by a minority of scholars, these forms may as well be dealt with at this
point. The IE evidence is somewhat contradictory, and Slavic itself shows a
variety of reflexes here, most of which seem to have some correspondences
elsewhere in IE, e.g.,
-m (< *-mu):
-mo:
-me:
-my:
R HHTaeM ‘we read’;
SC citamo - id, Ukr HHTaeMo - id;
Cz delame ‘we do, make’, Bg rjiejjaMe ‘we look’;
Pol czytamy ‘we read’.
Old Church Slavonic normally has *-mu. These forms do not fit easily into
the East-West-South division normally accepted for Slavic, or into the more
plausible six-fold demarcation discussed by Bimbaum 1966: 161-78.
The endings in *-mu are sometimes traced back to *-mos, see e.g.,
Ferrell 1965: 99. This leaves open the question of the origin of *-mo, which
is also usually derived from *-mos: Lat amamus ‘we love’ present, Skt
bharamah ‘we bear’ present (both < *-mos). On the basis of Attic Gk
*-men, e.g., cpepopev ‘we carry, bring’, Hujer 1910: 92, 1920: 27, followed
by, e.g., Mikkola 1913: 73; Kuznecov 1961b: 99; Feinberg 1978: 109;
Moszynski 1984: 262; Lamprecht 1987: 97, proposed an ablaut variant
*-mon (somewhat tentatively, Hujer 1920: 27 also suggested IE *-mn-\
Moszynski loc. cit. reconstructs *-mom), which would explain the ending
*-mu according to the standard ALG *-om > -ii (or *-n > -un > *-u). Such a
form is not actually attested anywhere else in IE, and some scholars, e.g.,
Vondrak 1928: 162, Ferrell 1965: 99, would deny the reality of such a re­
construction. The form *-me (?< *-mes) could be an ablaut variant of *-mo
(?< *-mos), and a similar variant appears in Doric Greek, e.g., cpeQopeg ‘we
bear’. The forms in *-my may have been formed by analogy with my ‘we’.
Baltic, too, has a great variety of endings: Lith -me, e.g., sukame ‘we
turn’ present (also sukam with loss of -e, corresponding to the Cz and Bg
forms cited above); Latvian -m, e.g., ejam ‘we go’ present; OPr -mai, e.g.,
giwammai ‘we live’ present.
1
1 This proposal might answer Vermeer 1991: 277 fn. 7, who suggests that there is a
tendency for scholars who attempt to operate without recourse to ALG to ignore ”,..
serious morphological problems ...”, specifically citing this one.
172 C h a p te r 6. O th e r P ro b le m a tic Form s
As with the 1st sg pronoun, there are simply too many forms involved
here to allow us to derive the forms in question unequivocally from *-mos,
*-mon, etc. A similar variety is found in the 3rd sg ending, (01-fil-tu), which
Miller 1988 treats as a relic of IE dialect differences continued in Slavic.
This approach might be applied to the 1st pi ending as well (Miller, personal
communication).
6.1.5. The Prepositions * v u -n -f *s u -n -f and * k u -n -
These forms are often cited as some of the strongest pieces of evidence in
favour of SI ALG *-dm > *-u, and should be dealt with under any treatment
that seeks to argue against them.
They also provide evidence that in my opinion is stronger for what is
taken as a necessary stage of *-om > *-u: the development of *-m# > *-n#.
The form vu ‘in’ is cognate with Lat, Go in, G k’
ev ‘in’, etc. The form su
‘with’ is normally reconstructed as a contamination of IE *som/sem/sm, cf.
Lat semel ‘once’, OIc sam ‘together’, Gk &- id < *sm-, etc. and IE
*korn/kemJkm, cf. Lat cum ‘together with’, OIr com ‘with’. The form ku ‘to’,
more problematic from the IE point of view, is normally cited as cognate
with Skt kam ‘for’ and Avestan kam id.1
2
One of the major strengths of this item of evidence is that in this case
the dropped *-N reconstructed in so many other ALG actually reappears in a
certain set of environments. The n- prefixed to 3rd person pronouns after
prepositions, known to Slavicists as n- mobile, can be traced back to final
nasal sonants on these three prepositions. From there it spread, in varying
degrees, to all preposition + 3rd person pronoun (PP) combinations. It is
usually argued that the *-n was simply lost before words beginning with a
consonant, but preserved in PP, e.g.,
*vuN +jenfi. > OCS vu njenti ‘in him’; R b hcm id; Pol w nim id
*suN +jimi > OCS su njiml ‘with him’; R c hhm id’; Pol z nim id
*kuN +jemu > OCS ku njemu ‘to him’; R k HeMy id; Cz k nemu id
In addition, the original -n is often preserved when these prepositions are
used as prefixes, e.g.,
12These forms are normally reconstructed as zero-grade, see, e.g., Trautmann 1923:
69, Shevelov 1964: 230, Schmalstieg 1983b: 48. Seiler 1958: 7 points to forms in
Greek where *en/on/n also shows a zero-grade, e.g., dievf|g ‘stretched’ < *n-ten-,
evretvco ‘stretch out’ < *en-ten-. Kurylowicz 1956: 233 sees them as original o-
grade forms, e.g., *on, *son, *kon, which would have developed according to the
standard ALG.
6 .1 .5 . T h e P re p o sitio n s *vu-n-, *su-n-, a n d *ku-n- 173
OCS vuniti < *vuN + iti ‘enter’
OCS vunusiti < *vuN + ux ‘in’ + ‘ear’ > ‘inspire’ (R BHyuiHTb id)
OCz vendu < *vuN +)idg ‘I will enter’
The evolution would probably have proceeded thus (using examples with
*suN for purposes of illustration):
CS1 *sun-jitru - treated as one prosodic unit.
CS1 *sun-jitmlsu-n-jitrulsu-njitru - competing analyses of PP
forms. However, the form su-njinii, rather than either of the two
alternates, would have been favoured by ongoing tendencies in
syllabification (the Law of the Open Syllables).
CS1 *su tijirrn - -n finally reanalysed as belonging to the pronoun,
thus giving rise to an independent form *su, which would have
spread to, e.g.,
CS1 *su tnunojg (< *su reanalysed as the basic form of the prepo­
sition, and generalised as such, almost completely ousting *sg, the
purely phonological reflex of *son/suti).
Forms such as, e.g., R (dialectal) cyced ‘neighbour’, Pol sqsiad ‘neighbour’
(< *sun + sedu\ Pol wqdot ‘ravine’ < *vun + dolu) can be seen as preserving
the original reflex under this framework.
This proposal is substantially the same as that advanced by Schmalstieg
loc. cit. to explain the problems normally dealt with by the traditional SI
ALG. At this stage, however, I would like to enter a caveat with respect to
the wider implications of this proposal: it should be restricted to the analysis
of close-knit phrases (phonological words) such as PP and PREPOSITION +
NOUN combinations, and not apply it to less closely-knit phrases (e.g., ad­
jective + noun), in other words PP and PREPOSITION + NOUN combina­
tions constitute a special case within Slavic, and generalisations should not
be made regarding the applicability of ^-mobile to other categories.
Nouns which have generalised initial n-mobile furnish another set of
forms that might be seen providing support for the hypothesis outlined here,
e.g., SC dialectal nugao, Lower Sorbian nugel ‘corner’, both of which
doubtless arose from the resegmentation of *vun-Qgulu as *vu-nggulu
(possibly via a stage *vu-n-ggulu), and the creation of a new nom sg
*nggulu, see Vaillant 1950: 205-07; Shevelov 1964: 230-31; Schuster-
Sewc 1988-1990: 93-96 for more examples. These forms might be seen as
instances of “local marking” as discussed by Tiersma 1982; a noun denoting
location or direction such as “comer” might be expected to occur with a pre­
position in most instances, and therefore its form in such an environment
might have come to be seen as its “unmarked” form.13 For more detailed
discussion, see Orr 1987.
6.2. *-o n s > * -y
6.2.1. The Masculine/Neuter Nominative Singular of the Present
Participle Active
The forms to be dealt with in this section are usually listed as canonical ex­
amples of *-ons > *-y. The ending is usually traced back to IE *-ons <
*-onts, or sometimes straight from *-onts, cf. OCS bery ‘taking masc/neut
nom sg sf’ < *herons (beronts); cf. Lith nesqs ‘carrying’; Gk cpegcov
‘bearing’, Latferens, Go bairands, see also above.
As with the forms discussed in 4.5 and 4.6, this topic is complicated by
early dialectal divisions within Slavic itself. For verbs of Classes III (*-je-)
and IV the endings are fairly uniform throughout Slavic: *-^, e.g.,
znaj% ‘knowing’(< znati (Class III)); mol% ‘asking masc/neut nom sg s f (<
moliti (Class IV)). For verbs of Classes I (*-e), II (*-ne-), and V (athematic),
however, the ending is *-y in South Slavic, e.g., OCS nesy ‘carrying’
masc/neut nom sg sf. Old Russian and Old Czech have -a, e.g., OR neca
‘carry’, while Old Polish has a short back nasal (written -0, with certain
forms in -a). The rest of the declension may be traced back to an IE formant
in *-nt-, with a *-j- extension: OCS nesy ‘carrying’ gen sg masc nesgsta
(South Slavic); OR neca id, gen sg masc necyna; OCz nesa id gen sg masc
nesuca; OPol nios0 id gen sg masc niosgca (North Slavic).1

At this stage we will briefly run through some of the traditionally-ori­
ented attempts to explain this phenomenon. Most scholars concentrate on
174_______________________ C h a p te r 6. O th e r P ro b le m a tic Form s___________________________
1
3Vaillant 1950: 207 suggests that traces of *-n mobile might also be seen in forms
such as R eepxnee ‘upper’< *virxunjeje, where the *-n- might be seen as the
original acc sg ending.
1
4The IE evidence points to the early appearance of a participial form in *-nt-, re­
lated to the 3rd pi desinence, also In Hittite it had PERFECT and PASSIVE
meaning, e.g., appant- ‘captured’, whereas in other IE languages it has ACTIVE
meaning alone. Greek and Sanskrit have some *-nt- participles with PERFECT
ACTIVE meaning, e.g., tpuyoVT - ‘having fled’, krant- ‘having done.’
They also have *-nt- participles with PRESENT meaning, which are of more re­
cent origin: cpeuYOVT- ‘fleeing’, krnvant- ‘doing.’
Germanic, Latin and Baltic use the *-nt- formation exclusively in the present,
e.g., Latferent- ‘carrying’, Go qimand- ‘coming’, Lith nesant- ‘carrying’.
Certain IE languages also have a *-j- extension, mainly in the fern paradigm,
e.g., Gk cpepouoa ‘bearing’(< *-ont-ja)\ Lith vedanti- ‘leading’; Skt nayanti-
ieading’; Go qimandei- ‘coming’.
6 .2 .2 . Z u b a ty 175
the *-aJ-y alternation. Nearly all the suggestions are based on acceptance of
the ALG *-ons > *-y. An alternative solution will be sketched below, based
on a morphological explanation.
A brief outline of some proposals which illustrate some of the main
trends in the scholarly literature is given below.
6.2.2. Zubaty
Zubaty 1893 invoked sandhi in an attempt to explain the differences be­
tween the SSI and NS1 forms. Combining the Gk evidence with the Slavic,
he proposed that there had been three IE forms for the nom sg masc: *-dn
(before vowels), *-o (before consonants), and *-onts (for monosyllabic
stems). The *-dn variant (developing to *-y) would have been generalised
for South Slavic, and the *-<5 variant (developing to *-a) for North Slavic.
However, the evidence for IE *-on in this form comes only from Greek, and
Brugmann 1911: 2: 131 suggested that this ending is due to analogy with the
*n-stems. Hujer 1910: 42^4-9 offered a detailed discussion, mainly following
Zubaty, and adding some modifications.
In his 1968b article, with the main points repeated in numerous subse­
quent works, Schmalstieg proposed that *-as and *-ans emerged as variants
in final syllables in Common Slavic, and that North Slavic generalised *-a <
*-as and South Slavic *-y < *-ans (*-ons\ see also 4.6.4). He incorporates
the pres act part forms into this framework.
Another sandhi-based theory was put forward by Georgiev 1969: 151,
who suggested that the explanation for the dialectal variation was to be
found by reconstructing sandhi variants: *-ans before a vowel which would
be generalised in South Slavic originally as *-g (< *-ans; later replaced, see
below), and *-as before a consonant, which would develop into Common
Slavic *-a, and be generalised for North Slavic (see also 2.5.4 and 4.6.4).
Although his proposal for sandhi variants is on rather shaky ground (see
4.6.4), his further analysis (151-57) of the origin of *-y in the South Slavic
forms seems to be the best proposal to date.
According to Georgiev, neither the North Slavic *-a ending nor the
South Slavic (and Lekhitic) *-g ending was free from ambiguity: the *-a
would have been confused with the nom sg fem *d-stem ending *-a, and the
South Slavic ending would have been confused with the 1st person sg
ending of the present. He proposes that the long-term solution over Slavic as
a whole was the gradual encroachment of the soft ending (*-^). Within the
short term, however, the *-y in South Slavic could either have come from
*-us, the reflex of the prevocalic sandhi variant of *-uns, the pres act part sf
176 Chapter 6. Other Problematic Forms
ending on the athematic verbs (e.g., sy ‘being’ masc/neut nom sg sf pres act
part < *sus < *suns < *sunts), or as a back formation. He also suggests that
*men-stem forms such as kamy ‘stone’ may have exerted some influence, as
well as a certain degree of confusion between the pres and past act part
forms (see 4.6.4, 4.9.5, 6.2.8 below).
6.2.3. Van Wijk
Van Wijk 1925 tried to solve the problem by proposing that IE *-onts had
*-« as a reflex in North Slavic, whereas IE *-ons developed into *-y every­
where. He attempted to bolster this by stating that kamy ‘stone’, which he
derived from *kdmons, never had a variant *kama. However, as we saw in
5.5, a variant kama is attested in certain R dialects up to the present day. The
problem here is that, as with so many proposed ALG, there is no parallel
development elsewhere. It is not clear how CS1 *-t could had a lowering ef­
fect on a preceding vowel. Another difficulty is that *-t elsewhere in
Common Slavic has the effect of PRESERVING nasal quality. Why should
that have been lost here? In fact, it was in this very context that van Wijk
declared: “Der slavische Auslaut hat viele unlosbare Probleme dieser Art
(1925: 285)”.
In his 1931 article Milewski (1931: 90-91) suggested that *-5 was added
to the participial form in South Slavic (*-dnt > *-dnt-s > *-dns > *-ons >
*-y) from the vocalic stems (*<5-, *«-, etc.), similar'to the *men-stems, but
not in North Slavic, where the development would have been regular for
*-dnt in word-final position (*-dnt > *-dt> *-d (*-a)). Subsequently (1932:
3-8) he repeated this analysis, attacking Zubaty and Hujer’s proposal of
*-dn and *-d sandhi variants, arguing that these were restricted to the masc
nom sg *men-stems, citing van Wijk’s denial of the existence of forms such
as *kama ‘stone’. He used these forms as examples illustrating his proposals
for the developments of long word-final diphthongs in Common Slavic.
According to Milewski, therefore, the NS1 form would be more archaic.
Milewski was criticised by Furdal 1961: 62-63, who cited dialectological
data.
Ferrell 1971 cites an extensive literature, and provides a brief discussion
of his proposal that the alternation rose from the simplification of the possi­
ble range of soft alternants of CS1 *-y from three (*-e, *-£, *-i) to two (*-<j,
*-i in South Slavic; *-<?, *-i in North Slavic), but he is hampered by his a
priori acceptance of *-ons > *-y.
6.2.4. Towards a Possible Solution 177
6.2.4. Towards a Possible Solution
The pres act part is one instance in the area of Slavic ALG that we have hard
evidence that morphological factors were at work, even if determining ex­
actly which factors, or their final results, is problematic.
At this stage we should determine how we should reconstruct the masc
nom sg sf. Possible alternative reconstructions are given below. Precise
dating is impossible at this stage.
Table 6-1
*-ont
*sekont (sekont)
Loss of *-t
*sekon (sekon)

*sekons(sekons)
(*sekdNt (sekoNt)) ‘cutting’
(*sekdN {sekoN))
{*sekoNts (sekoNts)) "
(*sekdNs (sekoNs)) "
According to the standard theory of ALG, we should expect THREE possible
forms from the above alternatives:
seku < *sekon (sekoN)
seky < *sekdnts (sekoNts); *sekdnts (sekoNts); *sekdns (sekons) (*sekdNs
(sekoNs))
sekg < *sekon (*sekdN)
*sekont {sekdNt)\ *sekont (sekoNt)
According to the hypotheses advanced in this monograph, however, all the
above endings should have developed to *-g.
We should now direct our attention to the If of the pres act part in
Slavic. At this stage we will consider forms from Classes I, II, and V, as
they often imply the ending *-y in the masc nom sg sf. Examples such as the
following may be found: m o g y -ji ‘being able’ masc nom sg If
(Assemanianus), zivQ-ji ‘living’ masc nom sg If (Marianus), ziv^-ji id
(Savvina Kniga).
The forms containing a nasal are extremely interesting for our purposes.
They are attested from the 11th century. Mircev 1963: 214 proposes that
they arose from the Middle Bulgarian mixing of nasals. The ending at­
178 Chapter 6. Other Problematic Forms
tested for verbs of Class III (*-je-) and IV (*-/-) shows a tendency to extend
its range to Classes I, II, and V, e.g., nesq ‘carrying’ masc nom sg sf
(Zographensis), vedq ‘leading’ masc nom sg sf (Suprasliensis), CSR necn
‘carrying’, npoudn ‘having passed’ (see below). According to Mircev, these
forms containing an -q can actually be traced back to an earlier * and the
appearance of *-g is due to the Middle Bulgarian mixing of nasals. The op­
posite process is also attested, e.g., poborqstaago ‘fighting’ masc/neut gen
sg If (Suprasliensis), where has replaced *~q.
The Middle Bulgarian mixing of nasals, however, is too late a phe­
nomenon to account for the appearance of the forms containing *-g. It
seems likely that the latter are, in fact, original (see Georgiev 1969: 144).
How should the co-existence of forms in *-Q-ji and *-y-ji be accounted
for? We can see a possible parallel development to the one cited by
Torbiornsson 1925 for the adjective declension,15 see also Schmalstieg
1968b.
The Slavic If adjectives (cf. R cmapuu ‘old’; sf cmap; SC vruci ‘hot’; sf
vru&, OCS belyji ‘white’ < *belu-ji\ belu) are originally derived from the
suffixation of the pronoun *jis to the short (nominal) forms. It is obvious
that a great deal of morphological reanalysis and remodelling has taken
place; one need only compare the Baltic cognates: Lith baltasis ‘white’<
*baltas +jis contrasted with Latvian baltais id.
Something similar may well have happened with'the pres act part. Let
us trace some of the possible lines of development for the masc nom sg If.
We will take the basic reconstruction of the sf as *sekons-, although we will
also consider *sekdn- and *sekdnt- (see 2.4.2, 2.4.5 for a discussion of VN#
combinations).
In Table 6-2 on the opposite page, neither *sekgsi nor *sekdnji, as cited
in Stage II, are attested in any Slavic language.16However, if we propose a
morphological restructuring, as in Stage III above, similar to that which
1
5In Orr 1983: 189-90 I hypothesised the prior existence of a CS1 form *belos(j)is
‘white’ masc nom sg If, parallel to Lith baltasis id, with *beluji arising later, re­
modelled on the basis of the new masc nom sg sf *belu. At the time I was unaware
of Torbiornsson 1925: 278 where such forms are actually cited, including Pol
bialosz - id, Cz belos - id, etc. < CS1 *belos-jis. Criticisms of this proposal, cf.
Shevelov 1964: 228; Lunt 1987: 274 fn. 67, Krysko 1993: 122, are unwarranted, see
Vermeer 1991: 280.
16Masc acc sg sf forms such as OCS bergsii ‘taking’ < *ber-ont-fi are not analo­
gous. The *-j- here is not pronominal; it is the stem formant referred to above.
6.2.5. Gender in the Pres Act Part 179
produced, e.g., OCS bely-ji in the adjective, we can formulate a plausible
explanation for the actually attested forms.

Forms such as sekgji seem to point to this sort of restructuring: the remod­
elling of the If to accommodate developments in the sf, similar to the devel­
opments in the adjective. These forms, however, are less numerous than
forms such as mogy-ji ‘being able’ masc nom sg If, which will be discussed
below.
If the pronoun *jis was added to the new form of the masc nom sg as a
result of this proposed remodelling, then it follows that AT SOME STAGE
this ending was *-g. Therefore we seem to have a clear case of final *-ons in
CS1 developing into *-g, parallel to those which seem to show *-os > *-o.
6.2.5. G ender in the Pres Act Part
The pres act part does not distinguish masc and neut in the nom sg, whereas
it does in the acc sg, e.g.,
Table 6-3

Acc Sg nesgsfi nesgstii nesgste nesgsteje
180 Chapter 6. Other Problematic Forms
For SI this is very odd (see 2.4.2, 3.2.3, 3.5.1, 5.3.1, 5.4 above). Further­
more, as we have seen, the neut sf, EVEN ACCORDING TO THE STAN­
DARD ALG, cannot be the result of a purely phonological development.
The neut nom sg pres act part sf can be reconstructed as IE *-ont or
*-on; in Common Slavic the former should develop into *-g, and the latter
into *-w, according to the standard theory of ALG. According to the theory
outlined in this monograph, however, they should both develop into *-g. To
reconstruct the neuter with an *-s ending in Common Slavic would create
too many problems: it is true that such a form is attested in Latin (e.g.,
ferens ‘bearing masc/fem/neut’, see above), but Latin has merged all three
genders in the nom sg of the pres act part; SI, however, still has a distinctive
form for the fern.
In 3.2.3 above it was proposed that a fundamental feature of the Com­
mon Slavic nominal system was the maintenance of distinctive neut, long
after it had been lost or weakened elsewhere in IE. The question must arise:
why did the masc and neut merge in this position, when the tendency in
Slavic was to keep them apart? I believe that the answer lies in the nature of
the pres act part; it is not a noun, but an adjective. In many languages with
gender systems (both IE and non-IE), the noun tends to carry the burden of
gender and accompanying adjectives must adapt themselves to their noun.
Pronouns also carry their own gender.17 As an adjective, the neuter form
nesy would have to take automatically take the gender of any accompanying
noun or pronoun—it had no inherent gender of its own. This might explain
why there was less need to distinguish gender in the pres act part than in the
noun. In this instance, therefore, nasalisation and the loss of *-s would have
caused the masc and neut forms to merge, and this merger would have been
tolerated because gender distinctions would not have been as important in
the pres act part as they were in the noun.18See also Krysko 1994: 134, and
the literature cited therein.
1
7In this connection it might be noted that there is much more syncretism in the
adjective in Slavic than in the noun, e.g., in Russian there is one pi adjective declen­
sion for all genders, whereas in the noun declensional endings vary in the pi from
gender to gender (mainly neut/non-neut).
1
8The evolution of this form in Russian can shed an interesting light on the subject.
It has developed into the present gerund (adverbial participle form, e,g., Human
‘reading’, uecn ‘carrying’).
6.2,7. Syncretism between Present and Past Active Participle 181
6.2.6. The Threat of Syncretism between Verb and Participle
The next question to ask is this: why should the *-g, reconstructed for one
stage of the masc and neut forms of the pres act part sf, have been replaced
at all? All of Slavic, with the possible exception of Old Polish, has replaced
it with a different ending. We must briefly examine the verbal morphology
of Common Slavic in order to formulate a suitable proposal.
As pointed out by e.g., Otr^bski 1954: 29; Mares 1963: 8; Georgiev
1969: 149, nasalisation and the loss of final consonants (especially *-s)
threatened the loss of vital distinctions in verbal morphology as well as in
nominal morphology, which would have been similar to those reconstructed
in 5.3; in this context specifically the 1st sg of the present tense of verbs,
and the pres act part masc/neut nom sg sf, e.g.,
Table 6-4
IstSg *sekdm19 > *sekg > *sekg
♦ (nasalisation and (morphological
loss of final *-s) reanalysis)
Masc Nom *sekdn(t)s
Sg Pres Act Part Sf
> *sekg > ?seky
Neut Nom *sekdn(t)
Sg Pres Act Part Sf
> *sekg > *seky
The distinction between the participial form and the 1st sg, vital for the
verb, was preserved by introducing *-y into the masc and neut nom sg pres
act part sf. This *-y may well have had the same origin as the *-y in kamy\ a
similar explanation might account for the *-a attested in forms such as OR
ueca ‘carrying’ masc nom sg sf (cf. Kcma ‘stone’). This approach is criti­
cised by Milewski 1932: 4, who follows van Wijk loc. cit. in denying the
existence of forms such as kama in this context, see 4.9.3, 5.5.
6.2.7. Syncretism between Present and Past Active Participle
Trubetskoy 1924: 134 showed that many original Common Slavic *«-stem
adjectives were derived from verbal roots and had an ACTIVE meaning,
albeit slightly modified. Arumaa 1948 and Otkupscikov 1974, 1983 go on to
cite additional forms.1
9
19I follow Shevelov 1964: 333, and 1971a: 52-53 in reconstructing a long vowel
(*-dm) in this ending.
182 Chapter 6. Other Problematic Forms
In Slavic, however, the ending *-us in participles is used for the PAST
act part, and is declined as a C-stem, e.g., nesu ‘having carried’ masc nom
sg sf < *nesus, gen sg nesuse < *tiesuses. These also have lfs; frequently
these appear as *-yji in OCS, e.g., nesy-ji< *nesu +jis, making them com­
pletely homophonous to certain pres act part lfs. It is therefore possible that
one source of *-y might be sought in back formations from forms such as
*nesyji.
6.2.8. The Origins of * - y in the Participial Forms
Two reasons, therefore, are being given for proposing a morphological/ana-
logical solution for the masc/neut nom sg of the pres act part:
1) The threatened homonymy between the 1st sg of the present tense
of verbs and the masc nom sg of the pres act part
2) The threatened loss of tense distinctions in the participles: the pre­
sent and past tenses should be differentiated.
Georgiev 1969: 153-56 draws attention to the fact that there also seems to
be a close connection between the pres act part and the past act part, and
points to a Lith dialectal form nesus ‘carrying’ masc nom sg sf, which he
proposes as a direct cognate of OCS nesu.. This form, however, has a LONG
vowel as a stem formant, making it closer to OCS nesy.20
Relying mainly on Gk data, Schmalstieg 1980: 56, quoting Brugmann
and Schwyzer, points to many vacillations between *-«- and *-u- as stem
formants, e.g., vexuq/vexdq ‘body’; %£'kvc,/yt'kvc, ‘tortoise’. Vaillant 1958:
270-71 points to similar vacillations in Latin and Baltic, but goes on to point
out that in Slavic *-«- and *-u- were kept distinct as stem formants.
Nevertheless I would like to suggest that the forms cited by Trubetskoy
et al. show that such a confusion may well have been present in Common
Slavic, albeit to a lesser extent, and that it could have served as a contribut­
ing, reinforcing factor.
Therefore I propose that the massive morphological realignment hy­
pothesised for Common Slavic nominal morphology as a result of the loss of
*-s, nasalisation, etc., also affected the masc/neut nom sg sf of the pres act
part. In this case, however, the realignment continued in a state of flux, and
the forms that it gave rise to were soon replaced. In addition, there were
varying dialectal solutions within Slavic: North Slavic generalised the *-a
20W.R. Schmalstieg (personal communication) sees Lith nesus ‘carrying’ as a
’’dialectal lengthening of an originally short -u-”.
6.2.9. The Development in Class III and IV Verbs 183
from forms such as *kama, while Old Polish maintained the nasal form, and
South Slavic introduced *-y, with multiple, mutually reinforcing origins:
from forms such as *kamy, a back formation from *-yji, and some degree of
confusion between *-w- and *-«- as stem formants.
6.2.9. The Development in Class III and IV Verbs
Verbs of Classes III and IV have retained the nasal reconstructed for verbs
of Classes I, II, and V; the *-q ending in Class IV being the direct lineal
phonological descendant of *-ins, e.g., raoI( ‘asking’ masc nom sg sf <
*mo(d)lin(t)s.
Class III verbs, e.g., znaj% ‘knowing’ masc nom sg sf, present a prob­
lem, however. In its declension the oblique forms are based on a form
znajgst-, showing an alternation.21 One thing is certain: this alterna­
tion is the result of a morphological restructuring. For an alternation *-e-
(nom sg masc (neut))/*-o- rest of paradigm, is attested nowhere else in IE.
At this stage the 3rd pi of the present tense should be brought into the
discussion, as commonly in IE there is a close connection between this form
and the pres act part, see, e.g., Schmalstieg 1980: 107. As we shall see be­
low, a plausible morphological reanalysis can be reconstructed if we assume
an interplay between the 3rd pi and participial forms.
Once again I propose a multi-stage morphological restructuring, bearing
in mind the need to distinguish certain categories.
Initially, ALL paradigm-internal vocalic alternations were obliterated in
the pres act part on the model of the 3rd pi of the respective verbs thus:
Verb Class 3rd PI Pres Act Part
(I) *nesdnt- *nesdnt(s)/nesdnt-j- ‘carry’
(II) *dvigndnt- *dvigndnt(s)/dvigndnt-j- ‘move’
(HI) *znajdnt- *znajdnt(s)/znajont-j- ‘know’
(IV) *motint- *mottnt(s)/motint-j- ‘ask’
(V) *daddnt- *daddnt(s)/dadont-j-22 ‘give’
21 Numerous forms are, however, attested with throughout, e.g., bor%‘fighting’-
poborqstaago ‘fighting alongside’.
Trummer 1978: 261 suggests that forms such as pis$ ‘write’(< *pis-jonts\ his
Class III example) may have been confined to South Slavic, and that *pisa might be
reconstructed for North Slavic, parallel to nesa ‘carry’.
22The pres act part forms are often perceived as derived from the 3rd pi, see, e.g.,
Hujer 1910: 47; for a possible example outside IE, see Schmalstieg 1980: 106-07.
184 Chapter 6. Other Problematic Forms
Subsequent steps are summarised in following table.

Morphological Restructuring
znajg znajz znajtt znajgtu
I would like to suggest that in the forms in Table 6-5, was generalised
as a participial ending (masc and neut) to save the distinction between the
1st sg of the verb and the masc/neut nom sg of the pres act part sf. Here
again, the loss of *-s may have served as a catalyst for the generalisation of
*znajens > znajq. in the pres act part sf; the choice of znaj% in this function
may have been dictated by the fact that *-g was the almost universal desi­
nence for the 1st sg.
In view of the large number of variant forms that.we find in OCS texts,
it seems as though the restructuring was never properly carried through, and
that it was later muddled by phenomena such as the Middle Bulgarian mix­
ing of nasals.
23As with the fem *a-stem acc sg, it is possible that the masc nom sg pres act part
sf originally preserved its length in order to distinguish it from the neut. In Orr
1983: 196-97, I proposed that variant forms *znajdnt(s) and *znajent(s) may well
have existed at some stage, with the loss of *-s serving as a catalyst for the generali­
sation of *znajent{s) > znaj<
j. A form such as *znajdnt(s) > *znajg would have fallen
together with the 1st sg form.
24The existence of *znajentu in the 3rd pi was probably transitory, with *znajontu
being swiftly re-established. One possible confirmation of the one-time existence of
*znajentu may be found in the behaviour of the oblique forms of the participle,
which normally have -jg-, e.g., znajz - gen sg znajgsta. The *-jg- sequence in the
participle was probably reintroduced when *znajontu ousted *znajentu in the 3rd pi.
In the nom sg masc/neut, however, znajz would have been preserved because of the
danger of confusion with the 1st sg if it, too, had reintroduced *-jg. In the participle,
however, the recovery of *-jg- was never as full as it was in the 3rd pi; numerous
forms (bor% ‘fighting masc nom sg sf’ - pobor^staago ‘fighting masc gen sg If) are
attested with *-<?throughout.
6.3. Conclusion 185
6.3. Conclusion
It has been argued in this chapter that all the problematic forms usually used
as support for the reconstruction of ALG in Common Slavic nominal mor­
phology may also be included under the proposed framework. Many of the
actual forms, however, especially the participles, show the results of multi­
layered morphological developments more complicated than discussed in
other chapters.
Chapter 7
Conclusion
This monograph has attempted to show that several of the problematic items
in the evolution of Common Slavic nominal morphology may be seen as the
results of a few overall tendencies, which were linked by the common
thread of preserving the complicated patterns inherited from Late Indo-
European/North Indo-European.
1) At roughly the same time as the far-reaching phonological and
phonetic changes, which are a given in the scholarship, the Common
Slavic nominal declensional system was affected by a set of
morphological/analogical changes similarly far-reaching in their
scope, which took place partly as a response to the phonological and
phonetic changes; several forms normally seen as problematic may be
explained as a result of morphological/analogical change to preserve
distinctions of number, gender, and case, in descending order of
importance.
2) The loss of final *-s, comparatively neglected as a catalyst for
morphological change in Common Slavic, may be shown to have
been of paramount importance.
The endings affected include the following: the nominative singular of the
masculine *d-stems; the vocative singular of the masculine *y<5-stems; the
accusative plural of the masculine *o-sterns; the accusative plural of the
masculine *jd-stems; the genitive singular and nominative/accusative plural
of the feminine *(/)a-stems; the nominative plural of the masculine *6-
stems; the locative singular of the consonant stems; and also possibly the
dative singular of the masculine/neuter *<5-stems; the instrumental plural of
the masculine/neuter *5-stems, and the nominative singular of the masculine
*men-stems.
3) The reconstruction of Auslautgesetze is therefore unnecessary for
Common Slavic, as every instance where they have been proposed
can be shown to have a more or less plausible morphological-
analogical explanation.
188 Conclusion
4) The Indo-European reconstructive base may be assumed to have been
slightly different from that normally proposed; the hypothesis that a
zero accusative ending survived into Common Slavic can be shown to
accord very well with the facts.
