Now that we have introduced both the points of articulation and the articulators, we
may begin describing sounds using both terms for a more complete description. Illustrations
1.4–1.6 below show that a relationship exists between a point of articulation and an articulator
for each consonant. The features involved in this relationship are the terms for our
description
Lesson 1: Introduction to Sounds 11
Illustration 1.4: [p] Illustration 1.5: [t] Illustration 1.6: [k]
In the following exercises, describe the sounds by first naming the articulator and then
the point of articulation. Repeat the sounds to yourself to help feel the points and
articulators. Try to master this exercise without reading the text. The responses required will
be listed before each drill.

For the tip-alveopalatal articulations in the next exercise, you may find it hard to tell
whether the sound is actually tip-alveopalatal or blade-alveopalatal. This distinction varies
between English speakers. You might pronounce the sound using the tip while another
speaker uses the blade. Neither way is more correct than the other, but in this manual we
have chosen to describe the sound as tip-alveopalatal. Respond by telling whether the
sounds are tip-alveolar or tip-alveopalatal.

Manners of Articulation
So far we have studied the air stream and the basic members of the speech apparatus.
Now we must take a look at how that air stream is obstructed. Based on the relationship
between the articulators and points of articulation, there are several different ways in which
the air stream might be modified. They might be pressed tightly against one another,
resulting in absolute impedance of the air stream, or they may be positioned a slight distance
Lesson 1: Introduction to Sounds 13
from each other resulting in lesser degrees of impedance. The air stream modifications which
result from this relationship are called manners of articulation.
Stops
The manner of articulation which imposes the greatest degree of impedance on the air
stream is called stops. With stops, the articulator is pressed so firmly against the point of
articulation that no air can pass between them. The velic is also closed so that the air stream
comes to a complete stop and is then released. Illustrations 1.4–1.6 demonstrate the blocking
of the air stream during the articulation of a stop. In normal speech, this blockage may occur
so rapidly it is difficult to feel, but for a short period of time, the air stream is entirely
stopped. Some common stops in English are P, T, K, B, D, and G. These sounds are
represented phonetically in the IPA as the lowercase versions of these letters: [p], [t], [k], [b],
[d], and [ɡ]. These stops are used in the words “pill,” “till,” “kill,” “bill,” “dill,” and “gill.”
Many linguists prefer to use the term “plosive” to refer to this type of articulation. Because of
inconsistency in the usage of the term, and to keep the terminology simple, we will use the
term “stop” throughout this course.
Basic stops are not hard to identify. If you are unsure about a particular consonant, try
prolonging the sound to see whether or not air is escaping during the articulation. For
example, pronounce the word “Sue,” prolonging the initial consonant so that you get
“Sssssue.” It is evident that no complete stop occurs here. Now say the word “too”
prolonging the initial sound. Here we find that the air stream is not able to move at all
during the “t.” The next exercise should help you to be able to recognize stops quickly and
easily. Respond without looking at the transcription.
Exercise 1.16: Recognizing Stops
1. [ɑkʰɑ] Stop
2. [zɑ] No
3. [ɑv] No
4. [ɑdɑ] Stop
5. [ɑfɑ] No
6. [tʰɑ] Stop
7. [ɑlɑ] No
8. [pʰɑ] Stop
9. [ɑgɑ] Stop
10. [ɑbɑ] Stop
11. [ɑxɑ] No
12. [ɑŋɑ] No
Fricatives
A fricative produces slightly less impedance than a stop. In fricatives, the articulator
approaches near enough to the point of articulation to restrict the air flow, but not near
enough to stop it. The air is forced through a narrow passageway between the articulator and
the point of articulation. This creates audible friction, sometimes heard as a hissing or
14 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
buzzing sound. Think of using a garden hose and increasing the pressure of the water by
covering the end with your finger. Like the water in the hose, the air stream is under higher
pressure as the size of its outlet is reduced. The term “fricative” is derived from the friction
produced by this restriction. Illustrations 1.7 and 1.8 depict fricative articulation.
Illustration 1.7: [s] Illustration 1.8: [θ]

8. [ɑg] Stop
9. [ɑʒ] Fricative
10. [ɑdɑ] Stop
11. [bɑ] Stop
12. [ʃɑ] Fricative
Not all consonants that have air escaping during their articulation are fricatives.
Remember that for a fricative the velic must be closed, and there must be a definite restriction
in the oral cavity that produces audible friction. If there is no definite friction produced as the
air passes over the tongue or if the velic is open, the sound is not a fricative. In the next
exercise there are sounds that do not fulfill the criteria for either a stop or a fricative.
Respond as directed.

12. [pɑ] Stop
13. [ɑbɑ] Stop
14. [ɑn] Neither
15. [ɑmɑ] Neither
Nasals
You may have noticed in the previous exercise that for some of the sounds, like [m] and
[n], the point of articulation and the articulator create a complete blockage to the air stream,
but air still escapes through the nasal cavity. We describe this manner of articulation as nasal.
In a nasal consonant, the air stream must be completely stopped in the oral cavity and the
velic must be open, allowing the air to be redirected through the nose. If you pronounce the
utterances [aba] and [ama], you will notice that the articulator and point of articulation are
exactly the same for the two consonants. The only difference between these two sounds is
that for the [b] the velic is closed, whereas for the [m] it is open. The same is true for the pairs
of sounds [d] and [n], and [g] and [ŋ]. Repeat these pairs to yourself several times to get a feel
for the difference in the velic. Illustrations 1.9–1.11 picture nasal articulation.
Illustration 1.9: [m] Illustration 1.10: [n] Illustration 1.11: [ŋ]
To tell whether a consonant is a nasal or not, it may be helpful to prolong the sound
and then pinch your nose with your fingers to shut off the air stream. If the consonant is a
nasal, the sound will stop when you pinch your nose since in a nasal the entire air stream is
directed through the nasal cavity.

Laterals
The lateral manner of articulation involves a lesser degree of impedance to the air
stream than fricatives. A lateral is a consonant in which the air stream passes around the
middle of the tongue as it meets the point of articulation. Lateral consonants usually have an
“L”-like quality. If you examine your tongue position during the initial sound of the English
word “leaf,” you will discover that the tip of the tongue fully contacts the alveolar ridge but
does not stop the air stream. It is important to note that the air stream is not restricted
enough to produce friction.
Lateral consonants are produced by directing the air stream around one or both sides
of the tongue instead of between the articulator and point of articulation. If you repeat the
sound [ɑlɑ] and prolong the “l,” you should be able to feel how freely the air moves past the
sides of the tongue. Some complication may develop here as many speakers of English do
not pronounce the “l” in the words “leaf” or “milk” with the tip of their tongue. If you are in
the habit of pronouncing “l” without touching the tip of your tongue to the alveolar ridge,
you must concentrate on doing so for the purpose of studying these sounds. The “l” sound
that feels more natural to you will be studied later on in the course.
Laterals are not portrayed in facial diagrams because diagrams are incapable of
portraying the sides of the tongue. In a facial diagram, an alveolar lateral would be
indistinguishable from [d].
In the following exercise, try to differentiate between all of the manners of articulation
that we have introduced so far. Practice this exercise until you can respond without
hesitation. Remember that it may be helpful to repeat the sound to yourself before
responding.

Now, we must learn to combine all of the terminology that has been introduced and
use it in the proper order for as full a description of sounds as possible. This skill is
foundational to the course and should be mastered with sounds that are familiar to you so
that you will have a good point of reference as we begin to discuss sounds with which you
are not familiar. The following exercises are formulated to help this terminology become
second nature to you.

20 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
In Lesson 1 we briefly studied the four manners of articulation. Before a deeper study
can be made, there is one more element of speech that must be studied. Voicing is the vibra-
tion of the vocal chords that creates sound. The vocal cords are the mucous membranes that
vibrate with the passing of the air stream. Some sounds require the vocal cords to vibrate.
These are called voiced sounds. Other consonants involve only the impedance of the air
stream and no voicing at all. Those are called voiceless. Every manner of articulation has
both voiced and voiceless consonants. Notice in Table 2.1 that every point of articulation has
both a voiced and a voiceless fricative. Voicing is the only difference between these vertical
pairs.
As each speech sound is represented by a specific phonetic symbol, each sound can
also be identified by its technical name (full description) which can describe only that specific
sound. Table 2.1 contains the phonetic symbols and descriptions for the fricatives that will be
focused on in this lesson. Some of these fricatives are very common in English, while others
will require some practice to learn.

Voiced β v ð z ʒ ɣ
Voicing
As we study these fricatives, we will find that some sets of fricatives share the same
articulator and point of articulation. For example, [s] and [z] are both tip-alveolar sounds
while [f] and [v] are both labiodental. The only distinction between these sets of sounds is
voicing. Voicing involves the action of the glottis, or vocal cords, during the articulation of a
sound.
Understanding Voicing
Illustration 2.1 illustrates the position of the glottis in the throat. The glottis, often
referred to as the Adam’s Apple, is the organ responsible for voicing. Its location makes it
necessary for air traveling outward from the lungs to pass through the vocal cords. The vocal
cords are made up of thin layers of membrane which may be either drawn together or spread
apart by the muscles of the larynx. As the air stream passes between the membrane folds,
Lesson 2: Fricatives and Voicing 21
they either vibrate or remain still based on the measure of tension applied to them. For
voiceless sounds, the vocal cords are relaxed and maintain their open position, allowing them
to remain still as the air stream moves through unimpeded. During voiced sounds, however,
the vocal cords tense and draw closer together. This creates a narrow opening through which
the air is forced, making the vocal cords vibrate.
Illustration 2.1: The Glottis
The following diagrams give a view of the glottis from above, illustrating the position
of the vocal cords during voiced and voiceless sounds.
Illustration 2.2: Tension of the Vocal Cords
Recognizing Voicing
The action of the glottis during voicing can be felt by placing your fingertips on your
larynx and prolonging the voiced fricative [z] as “zzzzzzzoo.” It should be fairly easy to feel
the vibration of the vocal cords during this sequence. If you have difficulty sensing the glottal
activity with your fingers, try placing the palms of your hands over your ears while pronoun-
cing the same prolonged [z]. The voicing will be perceived as a buzzing sensation inside your

head. The following exercise demonstrates pairs of fricatives which contrast voicing and
voicelessness. Notice that the articulator and point of articulation are the same for each pair
of sounds. The only difference between them is voicing. A pair of sounds with only one
phonetic difference is called a minimal pair.
Repeat the following sequences of fricatives after the recording while either feeling
your larynx or covering your ears with your hands. Try to feel and hear the contrast between
the voiced and voiceless sounds.
Exercise 2.1: Demonstrating Voicing
1. [sssssssszzzzzzzz]
2. [sszzsszzsszzsszzsszz]
3. [ffffffffvvvvvvvv]
4. [ffvvffvvffvvffvvffvv]
Practicing these sequences will help you learn to control your vocal cords. Repeat this
exercise until you can switch between voicing and voicelessness easily with no transitional
pauses.
Classifying Voicing
Every speech sound can be classified as either voiced or voiceless. Voicing must be
included in the technical name (full description) for each sound and is given before the point
of articulation. The voicing characteristics may be more difficult to distinguish on some
consonants because of their short duration. Learn to distinguish quickly and easily between
the voicing and voicelessness of the sounds in the following exercises so that you can apply
your knowledge of voicing in more difficult lessons.
The following exercise involves only fricatives. Each fricative will be positioned
between two vowels. As you listen for the voicing on the consonants, be careful not to let the
voicing of the vowels confuse you. You may find it helpful to repeat the sounds to yourself
while feeling your larynx with your fingertips during this exercise. Respond with voiced or
voiceless during the pause after each utterance.

Voicing must always be included in facial diagrams. Voicelessness is represented by a
broken line at the larynx. Voicing is shown by a wavy line, as shown in Illustration 2.3.
Illustration 2.3: Voicing
Introducing Fricatives
As explained in Lesson 1, manners of articulation deal with the relationship between
an articulator and a point of articulation. One manner of articulation we described is
fricatives. In a fricative sound, the articulator is held close enough to the point of articulation
to restrict the air flow, but not enough to stop it entirely. This relationship produces the
audible friction from which the term fricative is derived. Illustrations 2.4 and 2.5 below
depict some fricative articulations. Notice that in each diagram, the articulator and point of
articulation do not actually touch each other. A small space is left between them through
which the air stream is forced.
24 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Many of the fricatives introduced in this lesson are common in normal English speech.
These English fricatives will be introduced first, followed by those which do not occur in
English.
Labiodental Fricatives: F [f] and V [v]
The symbols F [f] and V [v] represent the same sounds in phonetic transcription as they
do in ordinary English. These fricatives are articulated between the lower lip and the upper
teeth. The only phonetic difference between this pair of sounds is voicing. The voiceless
fricative [f] is found at the beginning of the English word “face,” while its voiced counterpart
[v] occurs at the beginning of the word “vase.”
Tip Alveolar Fricatives: S [s] and Z [z]
The tip-alveolar sounds S [s] and Z [z] also represent the same sounds phonetically as
they represent in English. They are articulated by placing the tip of the tongue near the
alveolar ridge. Again, the only phonetic difference between these sounds is voicing. The
articulation of the voiceless fricative [s] is demonstrated at the beginning of the word “sap.”
The voiced fricative [z] occurs in the word “zap.”
Tip Dental Fricatives: Theta [θ] and Eth [ð]
The articulation of both voiced and voiceless tip-dental fricatives is shown in
Illustrations 2.4 and 2.5. These sounds are articulated by placing the tip of the tongue against
the upper teeth. They can be described as interdental as the tongue actually protrudes
slightly between both the upper and lower teeth. The involvement of the lower teeth does not
affect their sound at all, since the air stream does not pass between the lower teeth and the
tongue. Many linguists, however, prefer to use the term interdental when referring to these
sounds.
Lesson 2: Fricatives and Voicing 25
Illustration 2.4: Theta [θ] Illustration 2.5: Eth [ð]
The symbols for the tip-dental fricatives, Theta [θ] and Eth [ð], may be new to you, but
the sounds which they represent are very common in English. The [θ] represents the voiceless
“th” sound as in the English word “thin.” The [ð] represents the voiced “th” sound as in the
word “then.” The English words in the following exercise contain these fricatives in the
initial position. Pay close attention to the voicing as you repeat the sounds after the record-
ing. Practice the switch between voicing and voicelessness in utterances 6 a and b until the
difference is easily produced and distinguished.
Exercise 2.3: Producing [θ] and [ð]
1. a) θ = thigh b) ð = thy
2. a) θ = thick b) ð = this
3. a) θ = thin b) ð = then
4. a) θ = thatch b) ð = that
5. a) θ = thud b) ð = thus
6. a) θθθθθθðððððð b) θθððθθððθθððθθððθθðð
Tip-Alveopalatal Fricatives: Esh [ʃ] and Ezh [ʒ]
The fricatives Esh [ʃ] and Ezh [ʒ] also occur in English, although Ezh [ʒ] is a little less
common. For these two fricatives, the tip or blade of the tongue is placed near the
alveopalatal point of articulation. Remember that the alveopalatal point is the plane that
26 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
slants upward just behind the alveolar ridge. The Esh [ʃ] represents the voiceless “sh” sound
as in the English word “ship.”1
The Ezh [ʒ] is the same as the Esh [ʃ] except that it is voiced.
An example of this sound is the “s” in the word “vision.” Illustrations 2.6 and 2.7 below
picture the articulation for [ʃ] and [ʒ] respectively.
Illustration 2.6: Esh [ʃ] Illustration 2.7: Ezh [ʒ]
To produce the Ezh [ʒ], prolong the initial sound in the word “ship” and add voicing.
These fricatives are demonstrated in English words in the following exercise. Repeat each
word after the recording, paying close attention to the point of articulation and the voicing.
In utterances 6 a & b, practice the switch between voicing and voicelessness until the differ-
ence is easily produced and distinguished.
Exercise 2.4: Producing [ʃ] and [ʒ]
1. a) ʃ = fishing b) ʒ = vision
2. a) ʃ = mesh b) ʒ = measure
3. a) ʃ = dilution b) ʒ = delusion
4. a) ʃ = racial b) ʒ = beige
5. a) ʃ = plush b) ʒ = pleasure
6. a) ʃʃʃʃʃʃʃʒʒʒʒʒʒ b) ʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒ
1 Native English speakers naturally round and protrude their lips when pronouncing alveopalatal sounds and,
therefore, distort the pure sound.
Lesson 2: Fricatives and Voicing 27
In the following exercise, practice distinguishing between the tip-alveolar fricatives [s]
and [z] from the tip-alveopalatal fricatives [ʃ] and [ʒ]. Respond after each utterance with
“alveolar” or “alveopalatal.”

Now we must introduce some fricatives which may be altogether new to you. Learn to
produce them correctly with the help of the recorded exercises.
Bilabial Fricatives: Phi [ɸ] and Beta [β]
These fricatives, Phi [ɸ]2
and Beta [β], are bilabial sounds. Fricatives at the labial point
of articulation do not occur in English. They are, however, prevalent in many other languages
throughout the world. Illustrations 2.8 and 2.9 picture the articulation for these sounds.
Notice that primarily the only difference between them is voicing.
Illustration 2.8: Phi [ɸ] Illustration 2.9: Beta [β]
When learning a new sound, you must often learn entirely new muscle coordination
and speech skills. To produce phi [ɸ], the lips must be in about the same position as the
sound [p]. They must not touch each other completely, however; but be near enough to
produce friction when the air stream moves between them. Place your lips in position for [p]
2 The phonetic symbol Phi [ɸ] is slightly different from the Greek lowercase phi (φ).
28 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
and slowly move them apart until you are able to force air between them. Keep your lips
relaxed and flat. Do not let the air escape only from the center of your lips as if you were
simply blowing. The air must exit evenly along the entire width of the lips. You may also
learn this sound by pretending to blow out a candle while keeping a smile on your face.
The phi must also be kept distinct from [f]. In the articulation of [f], the lower lip ap-
proaches the upper teeth and friction is produced between them. The articulation for phi
must be kept farther forward so that the friction is produced between both lips. If you have a
tendency to produce [f], practice protruding your lower lip past your upper lip. With your
lower lip extended, blow air gently upward toward your nose while keeping both lips flat.
Practice the following exercise, mimicking each utterance after the recording. Say the
word “pig” keeping your lips relaxed so that they do not close entirely on the [p]. The word
will sound more like “fig,” but use [ɸ] and not [f].
Exercise 2.6: Producing [ɸ]
1. Pronounce the phi ɸig
2. Extend the initial consonant ɸɸɸɸɸɸig
3. Isolate the extended phi ɸɸɸɸɸɸ
4. Say the phi between vowels ɑɑɸɸɸɸɸɸɑɑ
5. Say it before the vowel ɸɸɸɸɸɸɑɑ
6. Say it after the vowel ɑɑɸɸɸɸɸɸ
Once you have learned to control the action of your vocal cords you will have no
trouble transitioning from [ɸ] to [β]. As was previously mentioned, the only difference
between the two sounds is voicing. To produce [β], try humming while prolonging the phi.
Another way to learn the sound is to prolong the vowel [ɑ] and, while continuing the voicing,
slowly close the lips toward the position for [b]. Do not let the lips touch completely. Keep
them relaxed and flat as for the phi. Follow the transcription for the next exercise and repeat
each utterance after the recording.
Exercise 2.7: Producing [β]
1. θθθθθθθθðððððððð
2. ffffffffvvvvvvvv
3. ɸɸɸɸɸɸɸɸββββββββ
Lesson 2: Fricatives and Voicing 29
4. θθððθθððθθððθθððθθðð
5. ffvvffvvffvvffvvffvv
6. ɸɸββɸɸββɸɸββɸɸββɸɸββ
Now say the word “base” without allowing your lips to completely stop the air flow.
It may sound like “vase,” but use [β] instead of [v].
7. Pronounce the beta βase
8. Prolong the initial consonant ββββββase
9. Isolate the extended [β] ββββββ
10. Say the [β] between vowels ɑɑββββββɑɑ
11. Say it before a vowel ββββββɑɑ
12. Say it after a vowel ɑɑββββββ
It is just as important to be able to hear and recognize these sounds as it is to produce
them. Many people find it much more difficult to hear the difference between labiodental
and bilabial fricatives. The following exercise was formulated to help you distinguish
between [f] and [ɸ] and between [v] and [β] more easily. Whether or not you encounter these
sounds in contrast in any given language, it is important to familiarize yourself with them as
much as possible. Listen to the following exercise and respond by telling whether the sounds
you hear are bilabial or labiodental.

Back-Velar Fricatives: X [x] and Gamma [ɣ]
These two fricatives also never occur in English. They are both made with the back of
the tongue raised toward the velum, very much like the articulation of [g] and [k]. Since they
are fricatives, the articulator (tongue) doesn’t quite touch the point of articulation, but allows
air to be forced between them. The only difference between the X [x] and gamma [ɣ] is
voicing. Illustrations 2.10 and 2.2 depict these velar fricatives.
Illustration 2.10: X [x] Illustration 2.11: Gamma [ɣ]
If you have studied German, you are familiar with the use of the [x] in the word “ach.”
It is produced by holding the articulation for [k] and slowly lowering the back of the tongue
until you are able to force air through. Try saying [ɑɑkxxxxx]. Be sure to keep the vocal cords
inactive. It may also help you to think of the sound that a cat makes when hissing at a dog.
Try whistling a song with the back of the tongue. You should hear [x] as a prolonged hissing
sound during the song.
Lesson 2: Fricatives and Voicing 31
Repeat the word “cot” after the recording in the following exercise. Notice that the “c”
in the word “cot” is pronounced as a [k] phonetically. Next, do not let the back of your tongue
stop the air stream, but pronounce it instead as the fricative [x]. The word should sound a
little like “hot,” but the [x] will have much more friction. “H” is a different sound that will be
covered in another lesson.
Exercise 2.10: Producing [x]
1. Pronounce [k] cot
2. Pronounce the [x] xot
3. Extend the initial consonant xxxxxxot
4. Isolate the extended [x] xxxxxx
5. Say the [x] between vowels ɑɑxxxxxxɑɑ
6. Say it before a vowel xxxxxxɑɑ
7. Say it after a vowel ɑɑxxxxxx
The gamma [ɣ] is nothing more than a voiced [x]. You can form the articulation of [ɣ]
by beginning with a prolonged [ɑ] and slowly closing the gap between the back of your
tongue and the velum as for the articulation of [g]. Leave a slight gap between the articulator
and point of articulation so room is allowed for the necessary friction. Think “g,” but keep it
slightly relaxed so that air can flow through, as in the utterance [ɑɑɑɑɣɣɣɣɣ].
Now practice controlling your vocal cords to produce the [ɣ] in the same way that you
learned the [β]. Begin with sounds with which you are familiar and move on to unfamiliar
ones.
Exercise 2.11: Producing [ɣ]
1. sssssssszzzzzzzz
2. ʃʃʃʃʃʃʃʃʒʒʒʒʒʒʒʒ
3. xxxxxxxxɣɣɣɣɣɣɣɣ
4. sszzsszzsszzsszzsszz
5. ʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒʃʃʒʒ
6. xxɣɣxxɣɣxxɣɣxxɣɣxxɣɣ
32 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Replace the [g] with [ɣ] in the word “good.” Remember not to let it sound like “hood.”
7. Pronounce the gamma ɣood
8. Extend the initial consonant ɣɣɣɣɣood
9. Isolate the extended [ɣ] ɣɣɣɣɣɣ
10. Say the [ɣ] between vowels ɑɑɣɣɣɣɣɣɑɑ
11. Say it before a vowel ɣɣɣɣɣɣɑɑ
12. Say it after a vowel ɑɑɣɣɣɣɣɣ
The following exercises will strengthen your recognition of these velar fricatives. You
may find it helpful to repeat each sound to yourself before responding so that you can feel
each articulation in your own mouth. Respond with “velar” or “no.”

Remember, to produce these new fricatives correctly, you must make sure that the
articulator does not contact the point of articulation and form a stop at the beginning of the
Lesson 2: Fricatives and Voicing 33
fricative. These fricatives are often pronounced incorrectly by beginners with an initial stop,
as in [kxxx] and [gɣɣɣ]. You must be able to hear this difference and pronounce them without
the stop. The following exercise contains some of these incorrect pronunciations. Practice
detecting them by responding with “fricative” or “wrong.”

Practice the following sentences, substituting the new fricatives that you have learned
for familiar sounds. This will help you to gain control of the use of these new fricatives
within utterances. You may find this more difficult than producing them in isolation. Listen
to the sentences and repeat each one after the recording. They will be given slowly at first
and then build up to the speed of normal speech.

40 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Pitch is the perceived melody that accompanies speech. Pitch is a linguistic feature
that is often ignored by beginner language learners, yet it is one of the most important keys to
the correct pronunciation of any language. All speech is accompanied by some kind of pitch.
As a person speaks, the level of his voice may go up and down or remain steady at some
level. In either case, pitch is always present. Pitch can change either the implied meaning or
the lexical meaning of a word or phrase. Even in English, the pitch associated with an utter-
ance can determine whether that utterance is interpreted as a statement or a question. In
other languages such as Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese, the lexical meaning of each word
changes with differences in pitch. No matter how it affects the meaning of spoken words,
pitch should never be overlooked or ignored. It must be practiced and drilled just like any
other feature of language. This lesson is designed to help you begin to hear basic changes in
pitch. The recorded exercises will build up slowly so that you will have a solid foundation
from which you can move on to more challenging lessons. Practice these exercises over again
and again until you can distinguish the pitch easily.
Mimicking the pitch patterns of a language is something that must be done from the
very first day of exposure to that language. Because language cannot be spoken without
some kind of pitch occurring simultaneously, either the correct pitch will be used, or the
speaker will carry over the pitch patterns of his native language. Unless the right pitch is
practiced while learning the consonants and vowels, wrong pitch habits will be reinforced in
the learner’s mind.
Linguistic pitch is not absolute, but relative in that it is distinguished by context.
When referred to linguistically, pitch does not relate to absolute notes on a musical scale. A
speaker of a language may produce a word or utterance with a tone at “middle C” or some
other note, but the musical note associated with the utterance is irrelevant. Voice registers
will differ between men and women and between children and adults. A person who speaks
in a high voice register would find it difficult to produce utterances using exactly the same
musical notes as someone with a low voice register. It makes no difference whether a tone is
produced higher or lower from one speaker to the next as long as its relationship to the other
tones in the utterance remains unchanged. Rather than being related to absolute pitch, levels
of linguistic pitch are related to the levels of surrounding pitch. The distinctions that must be
focused on in languages are whether a tone is higher than, lower than, or the same as the
other tone levels in the same utterance.
Uses of Pitch
There are two key ways in which pitch functions in languages. In some languages the
pitch affects the meaning of an utterance on the sentence or phrase level. These are called
intonational languages. Pitch can also affect the meaning of an utterance on the syllable or
Lesson 3: Pitch Variations 41
word level. Languages in which pitch changes the meanings of words or syllables are called
Tonal languages
Intonation
Intonation is the relative pitch that affects the implied meaning of a sentence or
phrase. In an intonational pitch system, the lexical meaning of individual words is not
affected by tone, but the tone changes the implied meaning. The pitch pattern can work to
imply different shades of meaning to a specific utterance. It is usually used to distinguish
between a statement and a question, to convey various emotional messages, or to indicate the
moods or attitudes of the speaker.
In English, an utterance said with a high or rising tone at the end is usually interpreted
as a question, while a falling final tone generally means that the utterance is a statement.
Intonation can also be used in other ways. In the following English examples, consider how
different pitch patterns can affect the implied meaning of the utterance.
Table 3.1: English Intonation Example
Example Sentence Explanation
I didn’t say you stole it.
A high or rising tone on the word “I” implies that someone
other than the speaker made the accusation.
I DIDN’T say you stole it.
A high tone on the word “didn’t” emphatically asserts that
the speaker did not say who stole the item in question.
I didn’t SAY you stole it.
A high tone on the word “say” implies that the speaker
believes that listener is the thief but did not voice this opinion.
I didn’t say YOU stole it.
A high tone on the word “you” implies that the speaker said
that someone else is the thief.
I didn’t say you STOLE it.
A high tone on the word “stole” implies that the speaker said
that the listener “borrowed without permission” or acquired
something through some questionable means.
I didn’t say you stole IT.
A high tone on the word “it” implies that the speaker made
the accusation that one or more other objects were stolen.
In each sentence, the meaning of the individual words is never altered by the change in
pitch. The intonation does, however, add a new aspect to the meaning of the sentence as a
whole. This is the key difference between an intonational system and a tonal system.
42 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
You have already learned that English is a language with an intonational pitch system.
Many English speakers are unaware of how important our intonation patterns are for correct
understanding of our language. A very common mistake of language learners transitioning
from one intonational language to another is to conclude that since tone levels do not make a
difference in the meaning of individual words, the intonation patterns are less important and
can be ignored. This is definitely a mistake. Incorrect intonation is one of the first things that
may point out a speaker as a foreigner, and can also cause serious confusion. It is very safe to
conclude that pitch, or tone, is equally important in every language and should be given a
place of top priority in your language study.
Tone
Tone is relative pitch that is used to distinguish the meaning of a single word. In a
tonal system, tone levels affect the meaning of an utterance in the same way that a consonant
or vowel might. Each word has a specific tone or tone pattern associated with it, and a differ-
ent tone can change the meaning of the word entirely. This is demonstrated in the following
example from Vietnamese.
Table 3.2: Vietnamese Tone Example
Phonetic Transcription Meaning
mɑ) tomb
mɑ! cheek
mɑ& ghost
mɑ* rice plant
mɑ% but
In each utterance we see that the consonants and vowels remain the same. Here the
tone is the only factor that makes the distinction between the meanings of these words. The
same is not true of an intonational system such as English. A word may be said with any
number of different tone variations and the basic meaning remains the same.
Lesson 3: Pitch Variations 43
Levels of Pitch
The first step in recognizing pitch is to become aware of the basic changes in pitch
levels. Pitch levels are the perceived levels of pitch ranging from high, to mid, to low. In
some languages, it will be necessary to recognize up to five different levels of pitch. In this
course, however, only three levels of pitch will be drilled.
Representing Pitch Levels
Tone levels will be indicated throughout this manual by lines above or below the utter-
ance. A line above the word represents high tone; a line immediately below the word is mid
tone, and a space below that, is low tone.

Distinguishing Pitch Levels
Regardless of what type of pitch system you may attempt to learn, you must strive to
reproduce the tone exactly as the native speaker says them. Many people think they are
incapable of hearing such distinctions, but with the proper training any person can learn to
recognize and reproduce any pitch variation. No matter what language you speak naturally,
you have learned subconsciously to produce the correct tone patterns when speaking that
language. This learning can be done again for a second language, but it may require more
effort.
In the following recorded exercises, listen for a single tone level that is different from
the others in the utterance. Each utterance will be the three syllable sequence [mo pi su].
Each example will be given twice. Respond with the syllable which carries a different tone. If
all of the tones in the utterance sound the same, respond with None. The correct answer will
be given afterwards on the recording so that you will be able to trace your progress. Com-
plete the exercises without watching the text if you can.
The drills may seem easy for some students at first, but it is important to master these
foundational skills before moving on. If you have no trouble with the exercises, try transcrib-
ing the tone while you are listening to the recording. If you have trouble hearing the tones,
try humming along with the utterances, mimicking the tone pattern, or watch the diagrams of
44 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
the tone patterns in the text while listening to the recording. Remember that you are not
listening for differences in the consonants and vowels. Tune out everything except the tone.

Types of Pitch
So far you have distinguished different levels of pitch. Now you must learn to recog-
nize different types of pitch. The following exercises contrast level pitch with glided pitch.
Level Pitch
Level tone is pitch that does not rise or fall. It occurs when the relative height of the
pitch remains constant throughout the duration of a syllable. This condition will be perceived
auditorily as an even note with no rise or fall. Whether the pitch is high, mid, or low is irrel-
evant as long as the level remains unchanged.
Glided Pitch
Up to this point our tones have all been level, remaining at the same height throughout
their duration. Glided pitch is a tone begins at some point and then moves either higher or
lower. A pitch glide is perceived auditorily as a tone that either falls or rises from one note to
another during a single syllable.

In the following exercise each utterance consists of the same one syllable word, while
the tones vary. Respond with “level” or “rising” after the utterance is given. The recording
will then give the correct response.

50 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Stops are speech sounds in which the articulator and the point of articulation contact
each other and completely obstruct the air stream. The velic is also closed during a stop so
that air cannot escape through the nasal cavity. This type of articulation is referred to by
many linguists as “plosive” rather than “stop.” The usage of the term “plosive” is often
inconsistent, sometimes referring to a subset of stops, so the term “stop” will be used
throughout this course. Table 4.1 gives the phonetic symbols and descriptions for the six
common stops presented in this lesson.
Table 4.1: Common Stops
Bilabial Tip-Alveolar Back-Velar
Voiceless p t k
Voiced b d ɡ
Stops
Stops were introduced in Lesson 1 as phones created by stopping the air stream
completely. The stops in Table 4.1 are the most common to English speakers. Study the table
and familiarize yourself with the articulator and point of articulation for [p], [b], [t], [d], [k],
and [ɡ]. If you would like to review stops, you may go back to Exercise 1.16 and Exercise 1.17.
You may have noticed that three pairs of stops in the chart above share the same
articulator and point of articulation. These stops are not identical, however. The difference
between these stops is voicing. Nearly any consonant may be either voiced or voiceless.
Table 4.1 above illustrates which stops are voiced and which are voiceless. To fully
understand the difference between these stops and the stops in subsequent lessons, you must
first understand voice onset time.
Alveolar sounds in English are pronounced using the tip of the tongue; however, they
can also be articulated with the blade. Linguists refer to the tip and blade of the tongue as
apical and laminal respectively. Occasionally, it is important to distinguish between apical
and laminal phones. To specifically indicate that a sound is articulated with the tip of the
tongue, a diacritic called the Inverted Bridge [  ̺ ] can be placed below or above a symbol, for
example [d̪] or [g]. A Square [  ̻ ] diacritic is used to indicate laminal (or blade) articulation, for
example [d̻] or [g]. Generally, it is not necessary to indicate apical or laminal articulation;
therefore, these diacritics will not be used in the exercises.
Lesson 4: Stops and Voice Onset Time 51
Voice Onset Time
In the lesson on fricatives you learned to distinguish between voicing and
voicelessness. Stops may also be either voiced or voiceless. It may be harder, however, to
hear the differences in the voicing of stops because they cannot be prolonged as much as
fricatives. This gives less time to hear or feel vocal activity. The stops in the chart above are
arranged in pairs that share the same articulators and points of articulation, but they have
different voicing characteristics. The sounds [p] and [b], for example, are both bilabial stops,
but [p] is voiceless while [b] is voiced.
Since stops cannot be produced without some vowel occurring with them, you may
tend to confuse the voicing of the vowels with the voicing of the consonants. The sequences
[ɑpɑ] and [ɑbɑ] will sound very much alike as both utterances have voiced vowels at their
beginning and end. The only difference between them is a slight break in the vocal activity
during the [p]. It may require a little practice for you to be able to distinguish the voicing of
the consonants from the voicing of the vowels.
Understanding Voice Onset Time
To thoroughly understand the voicing and voicelessness of stops, we must understand
voice onset time (VOT). Voice onset time describes the point in time when the vocal cords
begin to vibrate in relation to the time of the release of the articulators forming the consonant.
In other words, whether a consonant is voiced or not depends on whether the VOT occurs
before or after the sound is released. For voiced stops, such as [b], the vocal cords begin
vibrating before the lips actually open to release the sound. For voiceless stops, like [p],
voicing doesn’t begin until the articulators are released. It may begin precisely at the moment
of the release, or a slight moment afterward. This distinction will be explained further in
Lesson 6. The voice onset time of consonants can be illustrated in wave forms. The following
wave form diagrams will help you to understand VOT in voiced and voiceless stops.
The following diagrams illustrate the voice onset time of voiced and voiceless stops.
Illustrations 4.1 and 4.2 represent the same pairs of sounds. The wavy lines represent glottal
activity. Notice that for the voiced stop [b], the voicing begins before the release of the
articulators. For the voiceless stop [p], however, no glottal activity is present until after the
articulators release and the vowel begins. Illustration 4.1 has been simplified slightly to make
the glottal activity easier to read. Illustration 4.2 gives a more scientifically accurate version.

Voiced and Voiceless Stops

Controlling Voice Onset Time
The symbols for the stops presented in this lesson represent the same sound in
phonetic transcription as they do in English orthography. You must make certain, however,
that your voicing for the stops [b], [d], and [g] actually begins before the articulators release.
Many English speakers tend not to voice these stops fully, especially when speaking rapidly.
To gain control of the vocal cords during these sounds, try prolonging the stops and
exaggerating their voicing before the release. Remember that a stop can only be prolonged
until the oral and pharyngeal cavities fill with air, and then the release must be made. Repeat
each utterance after the recording. (The double triangles after the voiced stops indicates
lengthening.)

voicing of the vowels with that of the consonants. It may help you to repeat the sound and
prolong it, feeling your glottis with your fingers to check for voicing.

58 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Facial diagrams represent a cross section of the human speech apparatus. These
diagrams are simplified for phonetic purposes so that they show only those anatomical
features relevant to the articulation of speech sounds. Facial diagrams are helpful tools for
visualizing and discussing the articulation of individual phones. They give a better under-
standing of the interaction of the various parts of the speech mechanism. By drawing the
diagrams, you will be forced to pay close attention to the exact details of a given articulation,
rather than just having a vague idea of how it works. In this lesson you will learn to produce
accurate facial diagrams of basic sounds.
Not all sounds can be depicted by facial diagrams. A few consonants such as laterals
and sounds that involve certain actions by the sides of the tongue cannot be shown in a facial
diagram due to the side view nature of the diagrams. Because facial diagrams are a static
representation of conditions that occur in the speech tract, it is also hard to accurately portray
sounds that involve transitions or changes since they would require the diagram to show a
series of conditions that occur over a period of time, rather than a single condition as if in a
frozen moment. Vowels are also difficult to diagram since they do not involve any definite
articulators or points of articulation. Linguists do not usually diagram vowels due to their
open, ambiguous nature. Facial diagrams are a very helpful tool for illustrating most sounds,
however, and will be used extensively throughout this course to present basic facts about the
production of speech sounds.
The Five Variables of Facial Diagrams
There are five important features that must be included in facial diagrams. These
organs, which we will call variable features, are the lips, the tongue, the velic, the glottis (i.e.,
vocal cords), and the air stream. It is important to include all of these features when drawing
facial diagrams, and not just those which are actively involved in the articulation of a particu-
lar sound. For example, in a diagram of the voiced stop [b], only the lips and the velic are
actively engaged in the production of the sound, but the tongue and the teeth should still be
included in the drawing. The teeth and tongue still affect the acoustical properties of the
sound. A diagram is incomplete until all five of the variable features are in the correct
position for the sound being represented.
Lips
The lips can be actively involved in the articulation of stops, fricatives, and nasals.
More detail is given as to how to portray manners of articulation later on in this chapter.
Sounds that involve lip rounding can be demonstrated by drawing the lips as protruding
outward. When the lips are not being used in the articulation of the phone presented, draw
them in an open, relaxed position.
Lesson 5: Facial Diagrams 59
Tongue
The tongue is the hardest variable to accurately portray. The rear of the tongue (root)
starts as far back as the pharyngeal cavity, while the front of the tongue is anchored at about
the midpoint of the floor of the mouth. Since the functions of the tongue are so many, it is
divided into five different areas, any of which can act as an articulator. From front to back,
these are tip, blade, mid, back, and root.
Velic
The velic is the back surface of the uvula. This flap of cartilage separates the nasal
cavity from the pharyngeal cavity. When closed, it is placed directly against the wall of the
pharyngeal cavity. When opened, it hangs freely, allowing the air stream to pass into the
nasal cavity.
Glottis
Voicing is just as important to a diagram as the articulators and points of articulation.
An even line at the glottis with a space or gap in its center, as shown in Illustration 5.1,
indicates that the vocal cords are not vibrating during the articulation of the sound. This
means that the sound is voiceless. A wavy line that spans the entire width of the glottis rep-
resents vibration in the vocal cords, or voicing as illustrated in Illustration 5.2.
Illustration 5.1: Voiceless Illustration 5.2: Voiced
60 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Air Stream
In addition to voicing, the air stream must be indicated in the diagram. So far in this
course we have studied only one type of air stream movement. This air stream movement,
which we call egressive pulmonic, originates in the lungs and moves outwards. Egressive
pulmonic air is represented by a small arrow just below the glottis which points upward.
Examine the air stream indicators in the previous illustrations. Notice that the arrows do not
extend through the vocal cords. This is an important distinction as other air streams are
symbolized by arrows that extend through the vocal cords.
Drawing Facial Diagrams
Facial diagrams should always be made facing to your left. The manner of articulation
is represented by the relationship drawn between the articulator and the point of articulation.
Stops
For stops, the articulator must be shown as being closed against the point of articula-
tion. The velic must also be completely closed. Illustrations 5:.3–5:.5 depict some common
stop articulations. Notice the complete closure for the stops in these diagrams.
Illustration 5.3: K [k] Illustration 5.4: P [p] Illustration 5.5: T [t]
Lesson 5: Facial Diagrams 61
Fricatives
To depict fricatives, leave a small space between the articulator and the point of articu-
lation. Illustrations 5.6–5.7 illustrate the articulation of the fricatives [ɸ], [s], and [x]. The velic
remains closed as for the stops, but a space is left between the tip of the articulator and the
point of articulation. This space, or gap, is where the friction is produced. Do not make the
space so small that it is confused with a stop, but not so large it seems indefinite.
Illustration 5.6: Phi [ɸ] Illustration 5.7: S [s] Illustration 5.8: X [x]
Nasals
For nasal articulation, the articulator and point of articulation must contact each other
completely just as for a stop. The velic, however, must remain open showing that the air
stream is allowed to escape through the nasal cavity. This allows the air stream to resonate in
both the oral and nasal cavities. The next three illustrations depict nasals at the bilabial,
alveolar, and velar points of articulation. Notice that the velic is open for these sounds.

Incorrectly Drawn Diagrams
It is important to be accurate when creating diagrams of sounds. The following
illustrations show some common mistake made when representing sounds.

Lesson 3 introduced the concepts of pitch, tone, and intonation. Individual languages
differ in how they are affected by pitch. Pitch affects the implied meaning of a phrase or sen-
tence in an intonational language, while in a tonal language, the meaning of each word or syl-
lable is affected by its pitch. This lesson continues with the study of pitch as it is used in tonal
systems. In tonal languages, the pitch belonging to an individual syllable is called a tone.
Types of Tonal Systems
The different types of pitch, level and glided, were introduced in chapter 3. Pitch
glides occur when there is a change of pitch, or tone, within a syllable. If the tone remains
constant throughout a syllable, it is said to be level. Languages differ as to what types of
tones, whether glided or level, may accompany a word or phrase. In many cases, the type of
pitch noted on the word and phrase level is also true of the entire language.
Registered Tone Systems
In certain languages, only level tones are utilized. These languages are described as
having registered tone systems. In a registered system, no pitch glides occur. The only
changes in the level of pitch occur between syllables.
Contoured Tone Systems
Some tone systems may contain glided tones as well as level tones. These systems are
described as contoured tone systems. Thai, for example, has two level tones and three glided
tones. In a contoured system, the tone may rise, fall, or both rise and fall within a single
syllable.
The following exercise contains multi-syllable utterances with different combinations
of level and glided tone. Respond by telling whether each utterance contains registered or
contoured tone patterns.

Advanced Pitch
Languages vary as to how many different levels of pitch can affect the meanings of
words. Some tonal languages deal with only two different levels of pitch, while others have
been found which contain more than five. Determining how many and what types of tones
actually affect the meanings of words will depend upon a phonological analysis of the entire
sound system of the language, which is beyond the scope of this book. In your phonetic
transcription, however, you must strive to record all the distinctions that you hear in the tone
whether they affect the meaning or not.
Multiple Pitch Levels
So far in this course, only two levels of tone have been drilled. However, in actual
phonetic transcription, additional tone levels may need to be recognized and transcribed. In
this lesson, three different levels of pitch will be introduced and contrasted. These levels will
be termed high, mid, and low. The following table illustrates how the different level and
glided tones will be marked.

When learning to recognize multiple levels of tone, it may be easiest to practice with
registered tone before dealing with glides. The following exercise gives examples of three
distinct tone levels, first with a meaningless utterance and then with example words common
in English. Follow the transcription and mimic the tone levels.

Multiple Levels in Glides
Learning to recognize the relative length of glides is important when dealing with
multiple levels of pitch in contoured pitch systems. Contoured tones can glide between any
two pitch levels. Glides are described as long or short depending on what levels they begin
and end with. A short glide, for example, may glide from the mid level to one of the ex-
tremes, either high or low. A long glide moves from extreme to extreme, for example from
high to low, or vice versa.
It is important to note here that the length of the glide has nothing to do with the
duration of time for which it is held. A long glide, for example, may be spoken very quickly,
while a shorter glide may be held for a much longer time. The length of the glide is determ-
ined by the distance between the pitch levels at the beginning and ending of the glide.
The following exercise gives examples of long and short glides in relation to corres-
ponding registered tones. Follow along in the text and repeat each utterance.

Using Frames to Analyze Multiple Pitch Levels
When analyzing different tones and tone levels, it is often helpful to use a frame. A
frame is a word or group of words in which the tone does not change. You may use a frame
as a reference point with which to compare any individual tone. Placing the frame word
adjacent to the tone in question makes it possible to analyze the character of that specific tone
in relation to a known, constant tone level.
The following exercise will contain an English sentence as frame words for each utter-
ance. The tone will be level on all but the last syllable of each utterance. Listen to the last
syllable and respond by telling whether the tone is a long rise, a short rise, a long fall, a short
fall, or a level tone. The frame will provide you with a point of reference for your analysis.

Complex Contours
So far all of the tone glides drilled have been unidirectional, moving either up or down
during a single syllable. In some systems a complex contour exists where the tones can move
in both directions, rising and falling or falling and rising within one syllable. In the following
exercise, you will be introduced to these complex contours. Listen to each frame word and
respond with “rise” or “rise-fall.”

Methods of Pitch Notation
There are several accepted methods of notation used to represent pitch, each with its
advantages and disadvantages. Table 6.1 and Table 6.3 list several pitch transcription

methods. Which method you choose to utilize in your future linguistic work is your decision,
however, for this course you should familiarize yourself with each method so that you are
able to read and transcribe pitch with each.

Continuous Lines
The most basic tone system is the continuous line contour system, used thus far in this
course. This system was chosen because of its intuitiveness and simplicity for the education
of beginners. This system, however, is rarely encountered in anything beyond personal field
transcription. This is because contours are nearly impossible to type on computers and can
also cause intelligibility issues when drawn over some phonetic characters or diacritics.
Tone Numbers
When using tone numbers to transcribe pitch, a common way is to use [¹] for the
lowest level and count upwards for progressively higher pitch levels, ending with [⁵] as the
highest tone. Some linguists, especially in Mexico, reverse this number system and use [¹] to
indicate the highest tone and [⁵] for the lowest. The numbers are usually superscripted and
immediately follow the syllables they describe.
Tone Diacritics
Wherever tone diacritics are used, they are placed above the syllable to which they
pertain. The current convention is for tone diacritics to point toward the pitch level that they
represent. The high tone mark [ ́], for example, slants upward, representing a high level
Lesson 6: Progressive Pitch Control 77
pitch. A low level pitch is indicated by a downward slant [ ̀]. Glides are represented by
combining the diacritics for the beginning and ending levels of the glide.1
A glide from high
to low, for example, is marked by an “up-down” slant [ ̂].
However, the IPA now recommends to interpret tone diacritics as iconic (i.e., picturing
the tone). Therefore, [ ̂] represents a rise-fall tone. This method is much more intuitive but
lacks the precision of the former method. Because this method is not yet officially accepted, it
will not be used in the remainder of this lesson.
Tone Letter
In the tone letter system, tone letters can be placed above or following the syllable. If
the tone letters are placed following the syllable, care must be taken not to confuse these
symbols with the other phonetic segments of the transcription.
Table 6.2 above demonstrates each of the different tone symbolization methods. The
phrase used to illustrate the different methods is a phonetic transcription of the title of the
famous Chinese poem “施氏食狮史” or, in English, “Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den.”

Identifying Tonal Languages
A definite decision regarding the function of tone in a language must be based upon a
complete phonological analysis of that language’s tone system. There are certain conditions
that can be noticed in your initial phonetic work, however, that will give you a good indica-
tion of whether a language is tonal or intonational. If pairs of words are found whose

meanings differ, yet the only phonetic difference lies in their tones, you can be fairly certain
that the language is tonal. Such pairs of words are called minimal pairs since only one
phonetic difference exists between them. Minimal pairs are the strongest evidence of a tonal
system. Other clues include low tone occurring on stressed syllables, and the absence of
length on stressed syllables. In most intonational languages, on the other hand, high tone and
length have some correlation to stress in that they usually accompany stressed syllables. Not
all pitch systems conform to these patterns, but, in most cases, these tendencies can be
regarded as strong indications of the function of tone.

80 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
In everyday English speech, the voiceless consonants [p], [t], and [k] are not always
pronounced as simple voiceless stops. In many situations these sounds are accompanied by
an additional phonetic feature known as aspiration. Aspiration is a puff of air accompanying
the release of a stop. In American English, all voiceless stops produced in the initial position
are aspirated. You can see this condition clearly if you hold a thin piece of paper in front of
your lips and pronounce the words “pill,” “till,” or “kill.” Say the words as you normally
would in English. You will notice that the paper is blown away from your lips by a puff of air
when [p], [t], and [k] are released. The puff of air after each stop is the aspiration. Now con-
trast these stops with the same stops in the words “spill,” “still,” and “skill.” The slip of
paper remains motionless after the release of the stops in these words. These are unaspirated
stops. This feature, which may seem insignificant in our English speech, can change the
entire meaning of a word in many languages. It will be treated as a distinct phonetic sound in
this course. All voiceless stops can be either aspirated or unaspirated. Aspiration is represen-
ted by a Superscript H [ʰ] immediately after the stop symbol. The phonetic transcription for
aspirated stops such as [p] is [pʰ].
The following chart gives the symbols for new sounds introduced in this lesson. Writ-
ing aspirated sounds simply involves placing a diacritic near a symbol for the appropriate
voiceless stop. The chart also includes the symbol for glottal stop, which will be discussed
later in this lesson.

A wave form diagram of the voice onset time of stops can help us better understand
aspiration. The VOT of voiceless stops may begin precisely at the moment of the articulator’s
release or slightly afterwards, as mentioned in Lesson 4. This variance is due to aspiration.
The VOT occurs right at the time of the release of an unaspirated stop. In contrast, voiceless-
ness continues briefly after the release of an aspirated stop.
The following wave form illustrations demonstrate the varying voice onset times for an
unaspirated stop and an aspirated one. Notice in the diagram how the aspiration of the
second utterance occurs in the period of voicelessness after the [p] is released. Two separate

version and a more scientifically detailed one.

Aspiration makes no difference in the meaning of English words, so many English
speakers find it difficult to hear whether a sound is aspirated or not. Before you can control
its use in speech, you must be able to hear aspiration well. The exercises in this lesson are
designed to help you recognize aspiration easily.
The following exercise deals only with voiceless stops. Respond by telling whether or
not they are aspirated. Listen for the puff of air after the stop.

Recognizing (Un)Aspirated Stops
All voiceless stops may be either aspirated or un-
aspirated. In English, aspiration often helps us distinguish
between the voiced and voiceless stops in words like “pit”
and “bit,” “tick” and “Dick,” or “clue” and “glue.” Many
English speakers find it difficult to hear the difference
between unaspirated voiceless stops and voiced stops. One
reason is that English speakers do not always fully voice the
stops [b], [d], and [g]. Instead they produce unaspirated,
voiceless stops. Another reason is that the voice onset time
for unaspirated stops can be very close to the voice onset
time of some voiced stops. In the following wave form
diagram, the voice onset times of voiced stops, unaspirated
stops, and aspirated stops are compared.
Notice that the VOT is not the same between all
voiced stops or all aspirated stops. In fact, a whole range of
voice onset time exists between the first and third examples
and the third and fifth examples. There is still, however,
much less difference between the VOT of unaspirated stops
and voiced stops than between aspirated stops and voiced
stops. This is the primary reason that English speakers ex-
perience difficulty distinguishing voiced stops from un-
aspirated voiceless stops.

Producing Aspirated and (Un)Aspirated Stops
All English speakers produce both aspirated and unaspirated stops in their natural
speech. Because there is no difference in meaning, many speakers will find it difficult to hear
or control their aspiration voluntarily. In English aspiration is conditioned by its environ-
ment. Stops occurring at the beginning of words or utterances are always aspirated, while
those which occur after [s], or word medially, are unaspirated. We pronounce these phonetic
differences quite subconsciously. Learning to consciously insert or remove the aspiration may
require practice. Begin by developing strong aspiration. Mimic the following exercise and
exaggerate the amount of aspiration more than you normally would in English speech.

gerate the aspiration.

Many English speakers will find it harder to remove the aspiration from sounds where
it is not wanted than to insert it intentionally. There are several ways to learn to control
aspiration. The best way for English speakers is to take those situations where a stop is
naturally unaspirated in English and practice that sound until you can insert it in other envir-
onments at will. The following exercises build up from known sounds in familiar English
environments to unfamiliar environments. The voiceless stops in the words of the next
exercise are preceded by [s], where they are naturally unaspirated. Repeat each sound after
the recording until you can produce them as unaspirated stops without the initial [s]. Hold a
thin piece of paper in front of your lips to ensure that the aspiration is removed.

All voiceless stops may be either aspirated or unaspirated. Once you have learned to
control aspiration on these stops, you will be able to pronounce any voiceless stops that you
encounter in the future with or without aspiration. Although producing aspirated and unas-
pirated stops is not a new skill for English speakers, it may require a lot of practice to gain
control over your aspiration. Accurate control of aspiration is imperative to the success of
learning any foreign language. Incorrect aspiration may be one of the first things that mark
your speech with a foreign accent, or even cause you to say something completely uninten-
ded. Thai is one example of a language in which aspiration makes a difference in the mean-
ing of words. The following Thai exercise contrasts voiced stops, voiceless aspirated stops,
and voiceless unaspirated stops. The words are written phonemically which means that the
transcription may vary somewhat from a strictly phonetic transcription. Listen to the exercise
once all the way through, and then work through it again mimicking each utterance after the
recording. Follow the transcription.

Glottal Stops [ʔ]
All of the stops that we have studied so far are made in the oral cavity. Now we must
examine a special stop produced at the vocal cords. The Glottal Stop [ʔ], as its name
suggests, is made by a complete closure of the air stream at the glottis. The vocal cords are
pressed tightly together so that no air can pass between them. Glottal stops are made quite
frequently in English, although we rarely notice them because they do not make a difference
in the meaning of English words. In the utterance “Uh-oh!” (an interjection used to indicate
that something has or is about to go wrong) the “catch” in the middle of the word is a glottal
stop. The catch at the beginning of a deliberate cough is also a glottal stop. Certain dialects
of English replace [t] with a glottal stop in some environments, as in the words “kitten” and
“mitten.” Many speakers say these words without fully articulating the [t]. Instead they cut
off the air stream with the vocal cords, producing a glottal stop. In addition, English speakers
usually insert a glottal stop before word initial vowels, like in the words “it,” “ate,” and
“ouch.” If you say these words naturally, you will probably feel a catch in your throat just as
you did in the expression “uh-oh.” The symbol for Glottal Stop [ʔ] looks like a question mark
without the dot.
The vocal cords must have just the right amount of tension applied to them for voicing
to occur. They must be neither completely relaxed or completely tensed. They are directly
between the two extremes, in a state of optimum tension for smooth vibration. Air passing
through the glottis is required to produce this vibration. It is therefore impossible to voice a
glottal stop. During a glottal stop, the tension applied to the vocal cords increases as they are
brought together as articulators to form a stop. This increased tension and the fact that air is
no longer passing through the vocal cords makes it impossible for the vibrations that produce
voicing to occur. Glottal stops do not fit precisely with the definition for voicelessness either,
since during voiceless sounds the vocal cords are apart and relaxed. You will learn more
about these states of the glottis in a later lesson. However, since there are no vibrations of the
vocal cords involved, glottal stops are perceived auditorily as voiceless. You do not need to
88 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
include voicelessness in a description of glottal stops since there is only one possible voicing
state to associate with them.
Aspirated glottal stops do occur in some languages, but are not as common as other
aspirated stops and are usually limited to specific environments.
Recognizing Glottal Stops
Glottal stops are very common throughout English speech, but since we are never
forced to recognize their existence, you may find it difficult to hear them at first. English
speakers insert glottal stops at the beginning of words that start with vowels, for example
“attack” [ʔʌˈtʰæk] and “open” [ˈʔoᵘ.pʰn ]. Because this sounds so natural for an English
speaker, we will find it most difficult to hear glottal stops in the initial position. The
following exercise provides examples of occurrences of glottal stops in common English
words.1
They will begin by demonstrating glottal stops in the medial position, which is the
easiest for English speakers to distinguish. Follow the transcription and listen for the catch,
or break, in the sounds. Repeat each sound after the recording.

Producing Glottal Stops
Once you can recognize glottal stops, it is not hard to produce them. Most English
speakers will find it more difficult to remove glottal stops where they are not wanted than to
insert them at will. The next exercise will help those who experience difficulty with the
production of glottal stops. Repeat each utterance after the recording as it builds up from a
single glottal in a normal, English environment to a more unnatural sequence of glottal stops.

1. [ʔo] [soʔ] [ʔosoʔ] [ʔoʔ] [ʔoʔoʔ]
2. [ʔɑ] [sɑʔ] [ʔɑsɑʔ] [ʔɑʔ] [ʔɑʔɑʔ]
3. [ʔi] [siʔ] [ʔisiʔ] [ʔiʔ] [ʔiʔiʔ]
4. [ʔu] [suʔ] [ʔusuʔ] [ʔuʔ] [ʔuʔuʔ]
5. [ʔe] [seʔ] [ʔeseʔ] [ʔeʔ] [ʔeʔeʔ]
Eliminating Glottal Stops
In many languages, glottal stops make a difference in the meaning of words just the
same as any other consonant. You must not only be able to insert them at will, but also to
keep them from occurring in environments where they would naturally occur in your native
speech. Pronouncing utterance-initial vowels without a glottal stop before them can be quite
difficult for English speakers. To learn to say a clear vowel without a glottal stop, make a
slight [h] just before the vowel. This opens the vocal cords and prevents them from forming
the stop. In the next exercise, the first column is pronounced with a glottal stop before the
vowel. The second column eliminates the stop by placing [h] before the vowel. In the third
column, try to remove the glottal stop without actually saying [h] at the beginning. Repeat
each sound after the recording until you can eliminate the glottal stop and the [h].
Exercise 7.16: Eliminating Glottal Stops
1. [ʔo] [ho] [oː]
2. [ʔɑ] [hɑ] [ɑː]
3. [ʔi] [hi] [iː]
4. [ʔu] [hu] [uː]
5. [ʔe] [he] [eː]
Whether or not the glottal stops differentiate meaning in the language you learn, being
able to control their production will significantly improve your pronunciation. The following
exercise gives you an example of glottal stops occurring in real language. Kamasau is a
language spoken in the East Sepic province of Papua New Guinea. Notice how the glottal
stops are used as a meaningful consonant just as [t] or [k]. Follow along in the text and repeat
each utterance after the recording. Each word will be given twice.

Lesson 8:
Advanced Intonation
Lesson Outline
Producing Advanced Intonation Patterns......................................................94
Controlling Intonation Across Sentences......................................................98
94 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
In Lesson 3, the concept of intonation was introduced. Intonation involves the use of
pitch on the sentence or phrase level. In other words, intonation is the word used to describe
pitch that is spread over an entire phrase and does not affect the lexical meaning of individual
words. Rather, intonation serves to affect the implied meaning of a sentence or phrase.
Producing Advanced Intonation Patterns
The concepts which govern the modulation of the voice to produce pitch, and
subsequently intonation, have already been introduced. This lesson, therefore, will consist
mainly of exercises designed to increase your control over the use of intonation in longer
sequences of speech.
English is a language which uses an intonational pitch system. English intonations
patterns can be very complex, and are used in every utterance by every speaker of the
language. These intonational patterns can be used to separate a question from a statement,
indicate the mood or intent of the speaker, or lend emphasis to a particular word within a
phrase.
When learning a second language, one must learn not only to recognize his native
intonation patterns, but learn to control his intonation to fit the pattern of the second
language. The exercises in this lesson are designed to take normal English patterns and
embellish them so that the speaker must consciously control his intonation to fit the new
pattern.
The following exercises begin with simple three-syllable words build in length and
complexity. Eventually you will be asked to read an entire story with the intonation of each
phrase deliberately controlled. Follow the transcription of the following exercise and repeat
each utterance after the recording.

108 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
An affricate is a pair of sounds, a stop and a fricative, articulated together in a close
sequence. The stop is released into the fricative with no other sounds occurring between
them. Affricates can be found in nearly every language. Some view them as being one sound
and others as two distinct sounds. The initial sounds in the words “church” and “judge” are
two English examples of affricates. In this lesson, you will learn to identify affricates and to
accurately describe and reproduce them.
Identifying Affricates
When a stop is formed, the air stream is completely blocked, causing pressure to build
up behind the active articulator. There are three ways in which this pressure can be released.
When a stop is released directly into a vowel, as in the utterances [bɑ] or [pɑ], we call the
sound a stop. When a voiceless stop is released with a puff of air, as in the utterances [pʰɑ],
[tʰɑ], or [kʰɑ], we call the sound an aspirated stop. It can also be released into a fricative, as in
the sounds [pɸɑ], [tθɑ], or [kxɑ]. Such a sequence is called an affricate. In an affricate, there is
no intermediate sound between the stop and the fricative. The stop and fricative in an
affricate share the same voicing characteristic; they are either both voiced or both voiceless.
Types of Affricates
The most common type of affricate is homorganic. In these affricates the stop and
fricative are both produced at the same or very nearly the same point of articulation (for
example, [ts]). In homorganic affricates, the stop is released slowly so that as the articulator
moves away from the point of articulation, a fricative is produced at that same point of
articulation.
The technical names for homorganic affricates specify the point of articulation of the
fricative release, rather than that of the stop. For example, the affricate [t͡ʃ] is described as a
voiceless, alveopalatal affricate even though the stop is alveolar. Often, the articulation of the
preceding stop in such affricates is even modified to coincide more with the point of
articulation of the fricative. Most English speakers actually pronounce the affricates [t͡ʃ] and
[d͡ʒ] with an alveopalatal “t” and “d.” For this reason, the most accurate way to describe these
homorganic affricates is by the fricative’s point of articulation.
Affricates in which the stop and fricative do not share the same point of articulation
are called heterorganic (for example, [p͡x]). In heterorganic affricates, the fricative is formed
with its own articulator at the same time or before the release of the stop. When the stop is
released, the fricative is heard.
Lesson 9: Affricates 109
For heterorganic affricates, the description should include the point of articulation of
both the stop and the fricative. For example, the affricate [p͡x] is described as a voiceless,
bilabial stop followed by a voiceless, back-velar fricative or a voiceless, labial-velar affricate.
Symbols for Affricates
For most phonetic transcription purposes, the symbols for the stop and fricative alone
are sufficient to represent affricates since a stop and fricative in the same syllable must be an
affricate. However, it can be helpful to clearly indicate affricates with special symbols.
Usually, a Tie Bar [ ͡ ] above two symbols is used (for example, [t͡ʃ]). If one or more of the
symbols has an ascender, it is recommended to place the tie bar below the symbols (for
example, [t ͜
s]). Another method of representing affricates is to superscript the fricative (for
example, [tᶴ]). Finally, an affricate can be represented by combining the two symbols together
into a single symbol called a ligature (for example, [ʧ]). Table 9.1 demonstrates these different
methods used by linguists to represent affricates. In this book, a tie bar is used to represent
affricates when affricates are the focus of the chapter. However, in generic linguistic material,
no special symbols are necessary to represent affricates.
Table 9.1: Affricate Symbolization Methods

An affricate may function either as a single phonological unit or as two separate units.
In English, for example, the [d͡ʒ] affricate is usually considered to be one sound and can be
represented by a single letter, the letter “j,” as in the word “jeep.” The [t͡s] affricate, on the
other hand, is heard as two separate sounds and represented by two letters, as in the word
“cats.” This distinction must be determined by a phonemic analysis, which is beyond the
scope of this book. Phonetically, they are both affricates, but the fricative release may tend to
be shorter on those affricates which function as a single unit. This difference in the length of
the fricative release can be illustrated by comparing the [d͡ʒ] affricate in the word “sledge”
with the [d͡z] affricate in the word “sleds.”
English contains numerous affricates; however, only two different affricates occur
word initial: /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/. The following word final affricates frequently occur in English.
Follow the text through the exercise, paying close attention to the word final stop/fricative
combinations. The phonetic transcriptions will vary considerably from the English writing.

There are many other affricates in addition to those used in English. Table 9.2 and
Table 9.3 list some of the affricates found in languages throughout the world. These charts
are by no means exhaustive, however. Remember that any stop and fricative can be combined
to make an affricate as long as they share the same voicing characteristics and are in the same
syllable.

In some affricates, the sound of the stop is not as prominent as the fricative release,
making it difficult to tell whether the sound is an affricate or simply a fricative. The following
exercise contains both affricates and fricatives in the initial, medial, and final positions.
Respond after each utterance by telling whether the sound is an affricate or a fricative.

Aspirated Affricates
Like voiceless stops, voiceless affricates can be released with aspiration. Try saying the
word “church,” transcribed [t͡ʃʰɚt͡ʃ], while holding a piece of paper in front of your lips. You
will notice that the first affricate is aspirated while the second is unaspirated. You may find
this distinction difficult to hear at first because the fricative disguises the aspiration.
Remember that you are not simply listening for an aspirated stop. It is important to note that
the aspiration does not occur between the stop and the fricative, but after the affricate as a
whole. Any affricate can be aspirated, but the most common aspirated affricates are alveolar
and alveopalatal affricates. The following exercise demonstrates aspirated and unaspirated
affricates in English words. Repeat each word after the recording while watching for
aspiration with a slip of paper held in front of your lips.

Practicing Affricates
Now that you are somewhat familiar with affricates, it is important that you be able to
identify and reproduce them. Listen to the following recordings and give the full description
of the affricates listed. Remember the description for homorganic affricates specifies the point
of articulation for the fricative release rather than the stop. For heterorganic affricates, the
description should include the point of articulation of both the stop and fricative. You may
need to practice several times before you are able to give correct answers on a consistent
basis.

If two consonants occur together in a sequence with no intervening vowels, we call
them a consonant cluster (CC). Affricates are a type of consonant cluster. However, not all
consonant clusters of a stop and a fricative in series are affricates. In some consonant clusters
of a stop and a fricative, the stop is released slightly before the fricative actually begins. In
some cases, a small amount of aspiration occurs at the transition between the stop and the
fricative. These consonant clusters cannot be classified as affricates since in affricates the stop
must be released into the fricative with no intervening sounds. In producing affricates, you
must make sure that no unwanted transitional sounds occur between the stop and the
fricative. The following exercises will help you produce affricates which often give English
speakers trouble. Mimic each utterance after the recording and practice until you can
produce the affricates smoothly and easily.

As with stops, voiceless affricates can often sound like voiced affricates when they are
unaspirated. Exercise 9.10 contrasts voiceless aspirated, unaspirated, and voiced affricates in
Lesson 9: Affricates 115
English words. The unaspirated affricates do not fit English structure, so they will sound
foreign. Listen to the exercise twice. The first time just listen, and the second time, mimic the
recording.

118 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
So far we have learned to study consonants by examining their points of articulation,
their articulators, and the types of interactivity between the two (manners of articulation).
However, we cannot apply this same method to the study of vowels. The articulation of
vowels is much less definable than that of consonants. Vowels do not really have any definite
point of articulation. Although the tongue is always involved, the main difference between
the articulation of vowels and consonants is that vowels are produced with relatively free air
flow, with no restriction in the oral cavity or throat. Vowels, therefore, have a more open
articulation than consonants. The articulators do not come near enough to the points of
articulation to create any impedance.
The Articulation of Vowels
The articulation of different vowel sounds is accomplished primarily by changing the
size and shape of the oral and pharyngeal cavities. This is a result of altering the position of
the tongue, lips, and velic. Vowels will change in sound, or quality, as the tongue is placed
toward the front or the back of the oral cavity. They also change according to the height of
the tongue in relation to the roof of the mouth (palate) and the position of the lips. We
describe vowels, therefore, by areas of articulation. The position of the tongue determines the
area of articulation.
Position
Illustrations 10.1–10.3 show how the placement of the tongue from front to back affects
vowel qualities. This is called vowel position. The three positions with which vowels are
categorized are front, central, and back. The vowel shown in Illustration 10.1, symbolized by
[ɛ], corresponds to the vowel sound in the English words “bet” and “pet.” In this vowel the
highest part of the tongue is more toward the front of the mouth, and so the sound is
described as a front vowel.
Illustration 10.2 pictures the position of the tongue for a central vowel. The vowel
depicted corresponds with the vowel that you hear when the words “put” and “took” are
spoken rapidly. In Illustration 10.3, the vowel [o] corresponds with the vowel sound in the
words “soak” and “boat.” The highest part of the tongue is toward the back of the oral cavity,
therefore the sound is described as a back vowel. Try saying the sequence
[oɛoɛoɛoɛoɛoɛoɛoɛ] without any breaks between the vowels and notice your tongue as it
transitions from front to back. The position of the tongue is not the only phonetic difference
between [ɛ] and [o]. You may also notice a difference in the shape of your lips. This is known
as lip rounding and will be discussed later in this chapter.

Illustration 10.1:
Front Vowel [ɛ]
Illustration 10.2:
Central Vowel [ə]
Illustration 10.3:
Back Vowel: [o]
Height
Vowels are also described according to the relative height of the tongue as they are
articulated. The seven vowel height positions from closest to the roof of the mouth to the
most open position are close, near-close, close-mid, mid, open-mid, near-open, and open.
Illustration 10.4 pictures four of these positions. As the mouth opens, the tongue is drawn
away from the roof of the mouth. This creates a wider opening in which the vowel sound
resonates. As the mouth closes, the tongue moves closer to the palate. This narrows the
opening in the oral cavity. Illustration 10.4 shows how the height of the tongue can change
the quality of vowels. The vowel sound produced when the tongue is at its highest and
front-most position is transcribed as [i]. This vowel is described as a close vowel since the
tongue is close to the palate. Its sound corresponds to the vowel sound in the words “bee”
and “seat.” Vowels produced when the tongue is farthest from the palate are described as
open vowels. Say the sequence [iɛiɛiɛiɛiɛiɛiɛiɛ] and try to feel the difference in the height of
your tongue between these two vowels.

Illustration 10.4: Vowel Height
Rounding
The rounding, or shape, of the lips also affects vowel qualities. With some vowels the
lips have a rounded shape, while with others they are more or less straight. Watch your lips
in a mirror while saying the words “bee” and “boo.” Notice that with the word “boo” the lips
have a very distinctive rounded shape. Vowels articulated with rounded lips are called
rounded vowels. On the other hand, the vowel in the word “bee” is described as unrounded
because the lips remain relatively flat, or straight. In normal English, back vowels are always
rounded while the mid and front vowels are unrounded. However, it is possible for any
vowel on the chart to be either rounded or unrounded.
Vowel sounds can be charted according to the positions that we have described, which
include vowel height, position from front to back, and lip rounding. Illustration 10.5 is the
official IPA vowel chart system which plots the position of vowel sounds. The vowel chart
corresponds roughly with the position of the vowels in the oral cavity. This vowel chart does
not necessarily represent an exact diagram of the vowel system of any particular language.
The vowel qualities on the chart are theoretical. It is merely a reference system to which we
can compare the vowel sounds of any given language. This provides phoneticians a basic
framework with which they can chart the position of any vowel quality.

Lesson 10: Introduction to Vowels 121
Illustration 10.5: The Vowel Chart
Additional positions on the chart will be filled in with vowel symbols as our study
progresses. The possibilities of vowel qualities are not limited, however, to the symbols on
the chart. In fact, there are hundreds of vowel possibilities that may occur anywhere between
the ones charted, and some linguists even argue that it is impossible to make two vowel
sounds that are exactly alike twice in a row.
Defining Vowels
To clearly define the term “vowel,” it is necessary to discuss the classification of
sounds in terms of resonance and how the air stream is directed through the mouth. The
degree to which a sound resonates is called sonority. Sounds produced with greater
restriction to the air stream resonate less, and are thus less sonorant. Stops and fricatives are
classified as non-sonorant due to the heavy impedance of the air stream. Sounds produced
with relatively free air flow, on the other hand, are more sonorant. Vowels, nasals, laterals,
and approximants are classified as sonorants.
Sonorants can be classified as nasal or oral depending on whether the air stream exits
the nose or the mouth. Vowels are oral sonorants since the air stream passes through the oral
cavity. There are also two types of oral sonorants: lateral and central. For lateral oral
sonorants, the air stream is directed around the sides of the tongue. This occurs in sounds
like L [l]. Vowels are classified as central oral sonorants since the air stream passes over the
center of the tongue.

The Function of Vowels
Another way in which vowels differ from other phonetic segments is in how they
function within syllables. Each syllable contains a nucleus made up of one sound that is more
resonant or prominent than the surrounding sounds. The nucleus, called the syllabic, carries
the main beat of the syllable.
Vowels typically form the syllable nucleus, while consonants normally function as
peripheral elements surrounding the vowel. It is important to note, though, that some
syllables do not contain a vowel, in which case the most sonorant consonant present functions
as the syllabic. Other syllables may contain more than one vowel. In these cases, only one
vowel will be syllabic, while the other functions more like a consonant. These conditions will
be described in detail later in the course.
The Basic Vowel Symbols
Most of the vowels represented in the basic vowel chart correspond roughly with some
English word in one dialect or another. In the following list, each vowel’s sound is illustrated
by English words that match its sound as closely as possible. This list is not intended to
become the standard by which these vowel sounds are measured, as the pronunciation of the
words will vary depending on the speaker, and some of the illustrations are only approximate
to begin with. Also keep in mind that all of the vowels represented here are pure vowels, and
English speakers tend to glide the vowels in many of the example words.1
You should check
your pronunciation of the vowels with a qualified person instead of relying on your
understanding of the illustrations given.
Table 10.1: English Pure Vowels
Symbol Name English Examples
[i] I “eat,” “beat,” “elite”
[ɪ] Small Capital I “it,” “lip,” “listen”
[e]2
E “eight,” “bait,” “able”
1 Pure vowels are those without glides. For example, the “I” sound in the word “hi” is not a pure vowel
because it glides from [ɑ] to [i].
2 Most English speakers often produce [e] with a strong off-glide to [i]. This habit must be overcome in order to
produce the pure vowel.
Lesson 10: Introduction to Vowels 123
Symbol Name English Examples
[ɛ] Epsilon “end,” “pet,” “edible”
[æ]3
Ash “ant,” “bat,” “apple”
[a]4
Lowercase A “out,” “how,” “houses”

Barred I “roses,” “attic,” “English”
[ə]6
Schwa “ahead,” “degree,” “supply”
[u] U “boot,” “flute,” “doable”
[ʊ] Upsilon “put,” “book,” “looking”
[o]7
O “own,” “boat,” “over”
[ʌ] Turned V “up,” “mud,” “under”
[ɔ]8
Open O “awl,” “saw,” “office”
[ɑ] Script A “ox,” “mom,” “father”
[ɒ]9
Turned Script A “doll,” “Paul,” “calling”
3 English speakers normally add a [ə] off-glide to [æ].
4 The [a] only occurs as a diphthong with a [u] off-glide in normal American English. Some southern U.S.
dialects also use [a] in words like “hi,” “I,” and “pie.”
5 The [ɨ] is difficult for English speakers to distinguish from other vowels such as [ɪ]. The [ɨ] occurs in
unstressed syllables in normal speech.
6 The [ə] is perhaps the most common vowel in English, but it is difficult for English speakers to distinguish
from other vowels, especially [ʌ]. The [ə] occurs in unstressed syllables in American English.
7 The [o] almost always occurs as a diphthong in English with a [u] off-glide. In contrast, Spanish normally has
a pure [o].
8 English speakers fluctuate between [ɔ], [ɒ], and (less often) [ɑ].
9 English speakers fluctuate between [ɒ], [ɔ], and (less often) [ɑ].
124 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Symbolizing Open Vowels
Linguists often use the Lowercase A [a] to represent the Script A [ɑ] for convenience’s
sake. This should be kept in mind when reading other linguistic material. Also, the Greek
letter alpha [α] is occasionally used to instead of Script A [ɑ] because it looks quite similar.
If you examine Illustration 10.5 above, you will notice that there is no symbol in the
open central position. The open central unrounded vowel is actually quite common in
languages, but no separate symbol is given because linguists use the Script A [ɑ] for both the
open central and open back positions. The reason why one symbol is used to represent two
vowel positions is because they are not found contrastively in any language. For simplicity,
this book will always use the [ɑ] to indicate an open back unrounded vowel.

126 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
A syllable is a sound, or grouping of sounds, that is an uninterrupted unit and carries
its own beat. We use syllables as units of organization for sequences of sounds. Every
sequence of sounds has a certain rhythm, or beat, associated with it. When this rhythm is
divided into its individual beats, the groups of sounds which constitute each beat are called
syllables. For example, the word “baby” is composed of two syllables, or beats. The first
syllable is formed by the sounds “ba,” and the second includes the last two sounds “by.” You
may clap your hands or tap with your finger to the rhythm of the word to help you determine
the number of syllables. Syllables, therefore, are the basis of rhythm and are the phonological
building blocks of words.
The division of syllables is marked in this lesson (and in following lessons when neces-
sary) by a Period [.], also called a Full Stop. The process of separating words into syllables is
called syllabification. In the following exercise, use your finger to tap out the rhythm of the
following words. Count the number of syllables, and see if your count agrees with the count
indicated.
Exercise 11.1: Recognizing Syllable Divisions
1. [ʔɑ] 1 beat
2. [ʔɑ.pʰɑ] 2 beats
3. [ʔɑ.pʰɑ.tʰɑ] 3 beats
4. [ʔɑ.pʰɑ.tʰɑ.sɑ] 4 beats
5. [ʔɑ.pʰɑ.tʰɑ.sɑ.lɑ] 5 beats
A syllable may be composed of a variety of sound patterns, or consonant-vowel
arrangements. The syllables in exercise 11.1 have a consonant-vowel (or CV) pattern.
Exercise 11.2 illustrates several other consonant vowel patterns. Each utterance contains three
syllables of the same pattern. Tap out the rhythm of the utterances as you say them, and pay
close attention to the consonant-vowel patterns of each syllable.

Lesson 11: Characteristics of Syllables 127
Syllabics
During a sequence of spoken syllables, the articulators are continually transitioning
between open and closed positions. Consider the single-syllable word “bat.” At the onset of
this syllable, the lips are in a closed position for the [b]. This closed position reduces the
amount of resonance that can be heard. The audible resonance increases as the articulator
opens during the vowel, and then decreases as the articulator closes to form the [t]. The “a”
sound therefore is the most prominent sound, or the acoustically resonant peak of the syl-
lable; in other words, the nucleus of the syllable.
The nucleus of a syllable is called the syllabic. All syllables contain a syllabic and may
even consist of a single syllabic sound. The most common syllabic sounds are vowels. Since
vowels have a more open position than consonants, they typically occupy the resonant peak
of the syllable. Not all syllabics are vowels, however. Some consonants can also be syllabic.
Because consonants are not normally syllabic, a diacritic is used to indicate the syllabic qual-
ity. A short vertical line is placed either underneath [n ] or above [ŋ̍] syllabic consonants.
The most common syllabic consonants are voiced sonorants. A sonorant is a phone
that is produced without a significant restriction to the air stream. The relatively free air flow
allows the sound to resonate more strongly than restricted sounds do. Lateral approximants
(where the air comes unimpeded around the sides of the tongue), nasals (where the air comes
unimpeded through the nose), flaps, and trills are all classified as sonorant because they
resonate more strongly due to their lesser degree of restriction. Vowels are classified as
central oral sonorants because the air comes unimpeded through the center of the oral cavity.
Sonorants contrast with obstruents, which involve audible turbulence by obstructing or
restricting the air flow. Stops and fricatives are examples of obstruents.
Syllabic consonants are usually similar to vowels in duration, and they can also carry
tone. We indicate that a consonant is syllabic by placing a small vertical line, or syllabicity
mark (also called a syllabic indicator), beneath the consonant symbol [m ]. Any unmarked
consonant is assumed to be non-syllabic. It is never necessary to use a syllabicity mark
beneath a vowel because any time a syllable contains a vowel, the vowel is syllabic. Any
unmarked vowel is assumed to be syllabic.
In order to be syllabic, a sound must also be a continuant. This means that the sound
must be capable of being lengthened, or prolonged, while maintaining its original quality. It
is unlikely that stops would be syllabic, since they cannot be significantly prolonged.
Fricatives may be syllabic, although they occur much less frequently than sonorants.
The following exercise gives several examples of syllabic consonants in English. Fol-
low along in the text and mimic each word. Each utterance will be given twice.

Lesson 11: Characteristics of Syllables 129
Syllable Boundaries
As you learn to identify syllabics, the syllable boundaries will also become easier to
identify. Sometimes, however, a syllabic belongs as much phonetically to one syllable as to
the other. In such cases it may not be possible to determine the exact syllable boundary. (By
this we mean phonetic syllable boundaries, and not those boundaries which conform to
English grammar rules.) Consider the word “honey” [hʌni]. When diagrammed with a wave
form representing the syllable beats, we see that the [n] occurs precisely at the boundary
between the two syllables. In this case it is easy to tell which sounds are syllabic, but the
syllable boundary is not distinct. The [n] is shared by both syllables. English has many such
cases where a consonant belongs to two syllables, but there are other languages in which this
phenomenon does not occur at all.
Illustration 11.1: Syllable Peaks
and Boundaries
Stress
In utterances consisting of multiple syllables, one syllable will usually carry a greater
degree of emphasis or prominence than the surrounding syllables. This phenomenon is due
to several physiological factors. The muscles of the rib cage, the laryngeal muscles, and in
some cases the muscles of the articulatory organs themselves operate with somewhat more
force, and/or a broader range of motion than usual. This produces a syllable that stands out
from other syllables of the utterance. This prominence which distinguishes one syllable from
adjacent syllables is called stress. Just like tone, stress is relative to its surroundings. There-
fore, we determine whether a syllable is stressed or not based on its relationship with the
other syllables in its environment rather than on a fixed scale of stress.
Hearers do not usually perceive the physiological aspects of stress. Stressed syllables
nearly always exhibit one or more additional characteristics, such as, being spoken more
loudly, having a higher tone, having a longer syllabic, or having a wider range of vowel
possibilities than unstressed syllables. Unstressed syllables, on the other hand, are usually
h ʌ n i
130 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
spoken more quietly, have a lower tone, a shorter syllabic, or their vowels are reduced.
Vowel reduction is the phenomenon where a vowel is changed to more closely resemble a
central vowel, such as [ə] or [ɨ]. These additional phonetic features help us recognize stressed
syllables, but should not be mistaken for stress itself. The characteristics accompanying stress
on a syllable will vary from language to language.
Degrees of Stress
Linguistic stress is referred to in terms of degrees. Within an utterance, a syllable may
be stressed more than the syllable before it, but not as much as the syllable after it, in which
case there exists three different degrees of stress. Theoretically the number of possible
degrees of stress is unlimited, however, phoneticians usually do not identify more than four
degrees. These degrees of stress are primary stress, secondary stress, tertiary stress, and
weak stress1
. Throughout this course, we will usually concern ourselves with only two levels
of stress, primary stress and degrees less than primary.
Primary stress is indicated by placing a small Vertical Line [ˈ], called a stress mark,
just before the stressed syllable. The word “paper,” for example, in which the first syllable is
stressed, is written phonetically as [ˈpʰeⁱ.pɝ]. Degrees of stress less than primary are left
unmarked when recording only two levels of stress. At times, however, it may be helpful to
also mark secondary stress. Secondary stress is indicated by a small, Low Vertical Line [ˌ]
preceding the syllable. For example, in the word “diplomatic,” the first syllable has second-
ary stress while the third syllable has primary stress. Transcribed phonetically, it looks like
[ˌdɪp.ləˈmæ.ɾɨk]. English and many other languages often have words with three and four
different degrees of stress, and so in this lesson we will deal with secondary stress. Although
you will not be required to recognize secondary stress in subsequent lessons, primary stress
should always be indicated when transcribing utterances of more than one syllable.
The following exercise contains some common stress differences in English. Watch the
stress mark in the transcription and listen to the difference in stress placement.

The next exercises will help you recognize stressed and unstressed syllables. In the

Phrase Stress
Phrases also tend to contain one syllable with more emphasis (stress) than the other
stressed syllables in that phrase. This is called phrase stress. Consider the sentence “I’ve
always suffered terribly from stress.” Perhaps the speaker intends to emphasize how long he
has suffered from stress. In this case the first syllable of the word “always” will have more
stress than the other stressed syllables in the sentence. If he intends to emphasize how much
he suffered, the extra stress may be placed on the first syllable of the word “terribly,” or on
the word “I’ve” if he wants to clarify who it was that suffered. In English, the word that has
phrase stress usually has the highest tone as well.
Phrase stress is symbolized by a small, Raised Circle [ᵒ] just before the stressed syl-
lable. The primary stress and phrase stress are marked in each of the following sentences.
Read the sentences to yourself and consider the implied meanings of each one.
1. ᵒI’ve ˈalways ˈsuffered terribly from stress.
2. I’ve ᵒalways ˈsuffered ˈterribly from stress.
3. I’ve always ˈsuffered ᵒterribly from stress.
Now listen to the following sentences and see if you can recognize which syllable
carries the phrase stress. Respond by saying the word that contains the stressed syllable. Do
not watch the text.

4. You can ᵒeasily get that right.

5. ᵒI think you’re too busy.
6. I think you’re too ᵒbusy.
Juncture
Syllables in a sequence can be separated by an audible break, or pause, which is called
juncture. Like stress, juncture is relative rather than absolute. The spacing between syllables
can vary, ranging from a space too short to be distinguished to fairly long pauses. Juncture is
symbolized in phonetic transcription by a space the width of one or two characters. We will
not concern ourselves with different degrees of juncture.
In English, junctures usually occur at word or phrase boundaries. In other languages,
however, they can occur in the middle of a word. The following utterances contain examples
of juncture in actual languages. Listen to the recording and follow along in the text.

Rhythm
The timing of stressed syllables and the time span allotted to each syllable gives a
certain rhythm, or flow, to phrases. These stress and syllable patterns vary from language to
language, giving each language a distinctive rhythm.
There are two major categories in which languages can be grouped according to
rhythm: stress-timed languages and syllable-timed languages. Germanic languages like
Lesson 11: Characteristics of Syllables 135
English are stress-timed languages. In stress-timed languages, the stressed syllables are
evenly spaced. No matter how many unstressed syllables occur between them, the
unstressed syllables are rushed, or squeezed together between the evenly spaced stressed
syllables. Examine the rhythm of the following sentence. “Don’t ˈever forˈget to reˈmember
the ˈrhythm.” This is a good example of the even spacing of the stressed syllables of a
stress-timed language. Notice how the length of time between stressed syllables is more or
less the same.
Spanish and French are examples of syllable-timed languages. In these languages,
approximately an equal amount of time is allotted for each syllable, whether stressed or
unstressed. This can make these languages sound more rapid to English speakers, who are
used to having longer syllables periodically on which their minds can “catch up.”
Mimicking the rhythm of a language is just as important as a correct pronunciation of
the vowels and consonants. Even if you can pronounce each sound of a language perfectly,
you cannot sound “natural” without focusing on rhythm. Listen to the following sentences
and mimic their rhythm. (The first time they are pronounced, you will hear them with stress-
timing, which is the ordinary rhythm for English. The second time they will be with syllable-
timing.) Repeat each utterance after the recording.

Illustration 12.1: Some Common English Vowels
This lesson focuses on the symbols [ɛ], [ɑ], and [o] in the vowel chart above. Epsilon [ɛ],
Script A [ɑ], and O [o] were introduced in Lesson 10, but in order to pronounce these vowels
correctly, we must first discuss vowel glides.
Sometimes during a vowel sound, the tongue moves from one vowel position toward
another. This results in a slur, or glide, between two vowel sounds. Try saying the word
“high” while watching your mouth in a mirror. Notice how the jaw moves upward during
the vowel, pushing your tongue closer to the palate. Imagine a diagram of your tongue
superimposed on the vowel chart. For the word “high,” your tongue would start at the [ɑ]
position and move up the chart toward the [i] position. This non-syllabic movement of the
tongue from one vowel position to another is called a vowel glide. A vowel glide is produced
any time the tongue moves during the articulation of a vowel sound. In theory, a vowel glide
may begin at any point on the vowel chart and end at any other point, but normally the
selection is limited to four main vowel glides which we will discuss in this lesson.
A vowel glide may be either an on-glide or an off-glide. In short, this means that the
tongue can either glide toward the main vowel position (on-glide) or away from it (off-glide).
In a vowel glide, the beginning and ending vowel qualities do not usually carry the same
prominence. One or the other will be heard the most. This is the vowel that occupies the
nucleus of the syllable (the syllabic). With off-glides, the tongue moves away from the main
vowel position. The main vowel sound, or the syllabic, comes first, and then the tongue
glides away from that position. In the word “high” [hɑⁱ], the [ɑ] is the syllabic and the [i] is the
off-glide. English only has off-glides, so they will be studied first.

Lesson 12: Vowel Glides 139
Off-Glides
An off-glide is the movement of the tongue away from the nucleus of the syllable.
Off-glides are symbolized with a superscript character after the main vowel, such as [ɛⁱ], [ɑⁱ],
and [ɑᵘ]. In an off-glide, the first vowel is the “main vowel” or the the nucleus of the syllable.
This syllabic vowel is followed by a non-syllabic vowel which makes up the glide. The
following exercise contains examples of some common English off-glides. There are four
common off-glides in English: the [i] off-glide, the [u] off-glide, the [ɚ] off-glide, and the [ə]
off-glide.
The following exercise demonstrates the common English off-glides. The fourth will
be demonstrated later. Repeat each word after the recording and pay particular attention to
the movements of the tongue and lips. You may find it helpful to watch your mouth in a
mirror.

16. try [tʰɹɑⁱ]
17. doubt [daᵘt]
18. dart [dɑt]
[i] Off-Glide
For the close front unrounded I Off-glide [ⁱ], the tongue begins at any vowel position
and moves upward and forward toward the position of the vowel [i]. In reality, the glide
consists of the whole continuum of vowel sounds from the nucleus to the [i]. The following
diagram uses a vowel chart to illustrate this tongue movement from three different positions.
140 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Illustration 12.2: [i] Off-Glide
The next exercise demonstrates common English words with [i] off-glides from the
vowels [ɛ], [ɑ], and [o] as shown in Illustration 12.1. The glides may not be naturally present
in American English. Repeat each utterance, trying to say the words just like the recording so
that you can feel the tongue movements during the glides. Do not be distracted by the
consonants.

[u] Off-Glide
When producing the close back rounded U Off-glide [ᵘ], the tongue moves upward
and back, and the lips become more rounded. Say the word “cow” while watching your lips
in a mirror. Watch how they become more rounded as the tongue moves to the [u] position.

symbolized by turned [e], is made with the tongue and other features of the mouth in the
most relaxed, neutral position possible. It can also be used as a vowel glide. The following
table illustrates the type of tongue movement involved in the articulation of the mid central

Examples of the schwa off-glide in English are given in the following exercise. These

[ɚ] Off-Glide
The Rhotacized Schwa [ɚ], which corresponds to the American English1
“r” sound in
the words “bird” and “learn,” functions as a consonant in English, but is phonetically a
vowel.2
It is exactly the same as the Schwa [ə] except the tongue is retroflexed. It is
symbolized by adding a Right Hook [ ˞] to a [ə], and generally, it is rotated slightly. A Right
1 British English speakers do not retroflex vowels and, therefore, simply pronounce a schwa [ə].
2 Only syllable final “r” sounds in American English correspond to the rhoticized shwa [ɚ]. Syllable initial “r”
sounds are alveolar approximants [ɹ] and will be studied in later lessons.

Hook can be added to any vowel symbol to add the rhotic quality (for example, [ɑ˞]).3
Sometimes, a Superscript R [ʳ] is added after a vowel instead of a Right Hook (for example,
[ɑʳ]).
The Rhotacized Schwa [ɚ] is classified as a central oral sonorant. Its articulation is
open, allowing free passage of the air stream. Therefore, it does not have any definite
articulator or point of articulation. It is a mid central rhoticized (or retroflexed) vowel. It is
commonly referred to by linguists as an R-colored vowel. Like other retroflexed phones, the
tip of the tongue is curled upward slightly, giving the surface of the tongue a cupped shape.
This modifies the vowel quality from that of ordinary central vowels.
English speakers pronounce [ɚ] only in stressed syllables. Unstressed syllables are
pronounced as a Rhotacized Reversed Epsilon [ɝ]. For example, the word “murder” would
be transcribed as [ˈmɚ.ɽɝ]. These two phones may sound very similar, but the tongue is
slightly lower when pronouncing a [ɝ]. The [ɝ] is not used as a vowel glide in English.
Among English speakers, there are two variations of retroflexion for the [ɚ] sound.
Illustrations 12.5 and 12.4 picture these tongue positions. One variation is made by keeping
the back of the tongue low and curling the tip and sides upward. The other is made by
raising the back of the tongue and curling the tip up slightly. The Rhotacized Schwa
Off-glide [] is produced when the tongue moves away from another position to either
retroflexed positions.

rhotacity [e˞] and two Right Hooks for full rhotacity [e˞˞].

The following exercise demonstrates the [ɚ] off-glide as it is used in American English.
However, not all English speakers pronounce each of these words with this off-glide. If you

On-Glides
Just as the tongue moves away from the position of the syllabic vowel to produce
off-glides, it also moves toward the position of the syllabic vowel to produce on-glides.
English does not normally have on-glides, but you can see a similar type of movement occur
by watching your mouth in a mirror while saying the words “watt” or “yacht.” The English
Lesson 12: Vowel Glides 145
“w” and “y” sounds are actually consonants called approximants, which are often confused
with vowel sounds. Approximants will be studied later on, but for now it is enough to know
that approximants have a slight fricative sound that vowels do not.
English speakers have great difficulty in trying to pronounce on-glides, but they are
just the opposite of off-glides. In an on-glide, the tongue begins at one of the vowel positions
and moves to any other position on the chart.
There are three on-glides that we will study in this less. They correspond with some of
the off-glides that we have already introduced. They are the [i] on-glide, the [u] on-glide, and
the [ɚ] on-glide. Like off-glides, on-glides are represented by superscript symbols. In the
case of on-glides, however, the glide symbol precedes the syllabic vowel.
[i] On-Glide
The close front unrounded I On-glide [ⁱ] corresponds with the [i] off-glide in that the
tongue glides from the [i] vowel position. This glide sounds similar to the sound at the
beginning of the word “yoke.” Illustration 12.3 illustrates three of the many possible tongue
movements for the [i] on-glide.
Illustration 12.7: [i] On-Glide
[u] On-Glide
The close back rounded U On-glide [ᵘ] corresponds to the [u] off-glide in that the
tongue glides from the [u] vowel position. This glide is similar to the initial sound in the
word “wax.” Illustration 12.2 pictures three tongue movements for the [u] on-glide.
Remember that the glide can end at any position on the chart.

Illustration 12.8: [u] On-Glide
[ɚ] On-Glide
The Rhotacized Schwa On-glide [] corresponds directly to the [ɚ] off-glide. It sounds
somewhat similar to the sound at the beginning of the words “red” and “row.” In English,
the [ɚ] on-glide does not usually occur word initially. Words like “red” and “row” are
actually pronounced with the approximant [ɹ], which involves more restriction than the glide
[ɚ]. To articulate the [ɚ] on-glide, you can begin with the alveolar approximant [ɹ] as in the
example words above and reduce the amount of restriction slightly by making sure your lips
remain unrounded.
The next exercise uses English words to illustrate how on-glides are just the reverse of
off-glides. The pronunciation of these words must be modified to illustrate on-glides. In
normal English pronunciation, the sounds in question are approximant consonants. Also, be
careful not to pronounce Glottal Stops [ʔ] before on-glides.

2. Tiny Tim took ten tin tubs to Toronto.

Pure Vowels
A vowel glide is a non-syllabic movement of the tongue from one vowel quality
toward another. This results in an uninterrupted sequence of different vowel qualities. Any
movement of the tongue during a vowel sound results in a vowel glide. A vowel without a
glide is called a pure vowel. In order to produce a pure vowel, the tongue and other facial
features must remain stationary throughout the articulation of the vowel sound. This is often
difficult when it conflicts with natural habits incurred by language or regional accents.
The importance of being able to produce pure vowels and vowel glides cannot be
over-emphasized. Speakers have automatic tendencies, dictated by their native language
148 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
structures, to glide certain vowels in certain ways. Each language has its own patterns of
vowel glides which sound natural within that language. Certain vowels may never be glided
while others can have several different glides. When we carry the vowel glide tendencies of
our mother tongue over into a new language, our speech may be marked by an atrocious
foreign accent. It is important, therefore, to be able to consciously control glides and produce
pure vowels when necessary.
It is important, while learning the vowel sounds in this course, not to rely too much on
English words as examples of the correct vowel sounds. The pronunciation of English words
can vary considerably depending on the speaker, and even on the geographical area the
speaker is from. It is best to learn the sounds correctly by listening to the instructor and by
mimicking the recording.
Producing Pure Vowels
Review the vowel chart in the beginning of this lesson and repeat the vowels Epsilon
[ɛ], Script A [ɑ], and O [o] to fix in your mind their positions both in the mouth and on the
chart. For each of these vowels there are English habits that keep us from producing them as
pure vowels.
Some dialects of English, particularly the southern United States, glide epsilon [ɛ] with
a Schwa [ə] off-glide, as in the word “well” [wɛᵊl]. This glide movement may be very slight
and hard to notice, but you must learn to hear and feel it.
Normally, English speakers pronounce an [o] with a [u] off-glide. You should be able to
see this glide and the associated lip rounding quite easily in a mirror as you pronounce the
word “boat.”
The exact position of Script A [ɑ] fluctuates forward and backward from the cardinal
position. Occasionally, some English dialects add a Schwa [ə] off-glide or round their lips
slightly.
The following exercises are designed to help you overcome these habits and produce
pure vowels. Follow along in the text and mimic each utterance after the recordings. Watch
your mouth in a mirror to ensure that your articulatory features remain stationary during the
vowels.

Approximants
Vowel glides are very similar to central approximants. In fact, many phoneticians
prefer to use approximant symbols to represent glides. There are slight articulatory
differences, however, between approximants and vowel glides. Approximants are produced
with slightly more restriction to the air stream than vowels. The amount of restriction
involved in the articulation of central approximants may be thought of as halfway between
that of vowels and fricatives. A glided sound involving an approximant, therefore, will
contain a small amount of friction, while a true vowel glide will not. Often glides and
approximants are used interchangeably in speech, making transcription difficult if attempting
to differentiate between the two. Most linguists prefer to treat them as the same and choose a
Lesson 12: Vowel Glides 151
single symbol to represent both sounds. In this course, we choose to recognize the distinction
between the two sounds and represent them accordingly. Central approximants will be
studied further in a later lesson.
Methods of Representation
There are several methods of representing vowel glides among linguists today. Some
linguists use approximant symbols to represent glides due to the ease of typing that this
system affords, despite the ambiguity. Others prefer to use an Inverted Breve [  ̯ ] either
below [i̯] or above [y̑] a symbol to indicate non-syllabic vowels. Many linguists do not use any
special symbol to indicate glides, since whenever two vowels are in one syllable, one of them
must be a glide, and the phonetic difference between a glide and a vowel is rarely significant.
In this course, superscript symbols are always used to represent glides. This makes it
possible to achieve better consistency when dealing with the articulatory differences between
glides and approximants. Table 12.1 below lists several different methods for presenting
vowel glides. Although some of these methods are more accurate than others, they are all
commonly used with no particular method favored strongly by the IPA or linguists in
general. In some phonetic material, you may find all four methods implemented; however,
this should be avoided as it could generate confusion. The following table lists all of the
possible combinations of the different systems to symbolize a triphthong.4

154 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Thus far in our study of consonants we have studied labial, dental, alveolar,
alveopalatal, palatal, velar, and uvular consonants. The articulation of each of these
consonants may be modified, or altered, in a number of ways. Alveolar consonants can be
modified by pushing the tongue slightly forward, pulling it farther back, or curling it at the
tip. Each of these variations results in a different sound. In this lesson we will discuss the
variations of both alveolar and alveopalatal consonants.
Some linguists argue that the sounds presented in this chapter may actually represent
separate points of articulation, rather than variations of sounds made at the alveolar and
alveopalatal points. However, since the phonetic difference can be slight, and these sounds
are not normally found contrastively in languages, these new consonants are not usually
given a separate symbol. They are represented with the symbols of the alveolar and
alveopalatal consonants, with an added diacritic to denote the modification of the
articulation.
Fronted Consonants
Every alveolar sound has a corresponding fronted counterpart. Fronted sounds are
symbolized by placing a Bridge [  ̪ ] (sometimes called a Tooth)beneath [t̪] or above [ɮ͆] a
symbol. Fronting occurs on alveolar consonants more than any other point of articulation.
Understanding Fronting
Fronted consonants are produced when the tongue is placed slightly forward from its
ordinary position. For fronted alveolar sounds, the tip of the tongue is placed firmly against
the back of the upper teeth or the roof of the mouth immediately behind the upper teeth. For
this reason, fronted sounds are often called dentalized. Illustrations 13.1 and 13.2 below
contrast the position of the tongue in an alveolar stop to a fronted alveolar stop. The same
diagrams could apply to fronted fricatives if a small amount of space is left between the
articulator and the point of articulation. Notice, however, that the tip of the tongue is not on
the edge of the teeth, or between the teeth as in dental fricatives [θ] and [ð]. We will discuss
the distinctions between those sounds later in this chapter.
Affricates can be fronted as well. Although the stop and fricative in an affricate can be
made at different points of articulation (heterorganic affricates), you should not worry about
practicing affricates with one fronted sound and one alveolar sound. If one element of an
affricate is fronted, the other will usually be fronted as well.
Lesson 13: Fronting, Retroflexion, and Sibilants 155
Producing Fronted Sounds
Illustration 13.1: [t] Illustration 13.2: [t̪]
Place the tip of your tongue against the inside of your upper teeth, as shown above in
Illustration 13.2. Now say [d̪ɑ], [t̪ɑ], and [t̪ʰɑ]. These are fronted alveolar stops, also described
as tip-dental stops. Fronted stops are fairly easy to produce. You can practice them by
replacing each alveolar stop with a fronted stop in the following sentences.
1. T̪en t̪an t̪rucks t̪ook T̪erry’s t̪rash t̪o t̪own t̪oday.
2. D̪ear D̪ad̪d̪y d̪on’t̪ d̪o that̪.
To produce a fronted alveolar fricative, place the tip of your tongue near the back of
your upper teeth and say [sa] and [za]. Say the following sentences fronting the alveolar
fricatives.
3. S̪is̪ter S̪ue s̪its̪ s̪ewing s̪ocks̪ for s̪eas̪ick s̪uffering s̪ailors̪.
4. Z̪any z̪ebras̪ z̪ip and z̪oom.
Fronted stops are easy to articulate and are easy to see when watching someone speak,
but the acoustic difference is not as easy to detect. Fronted fricatives are much easier to
distinguish by ear. The articulation is the same as that of stops, but the air stream is not
completely impeded.
Listen to the following exercise and tell whether the sounds you hear are fronted or
not. The exercise begins with fricatives, which are easiest to hear, and builds up to affricates
and stops. Respond with “dental” or “alveolar.”

Retroflexed Consonants
Another variation that can be imposed on alveolar and alveopalatal consonants in
retroflexion. The basic concept of retroflexion was introduced with Rhotacized Schwa [ɚ] in
Lesson 12. Retroflexion occurs when the tip of the tongue is curled up and/or back slightly
during a sound. Retroflexed consonants are found in approximately 20% of the worlds
languages.
Understanding Retroflexion
As explained for the Rhotacized Schwa [ɚ] in Lesson 12, retroflexed sounds are
articulated by curling the tongue tip upward and slightly back, creating a cup shape in the
surface of the tongue. Study Illustrations 13.3 and 13.4 below to see retroflexed articulation
compared with the normal articulation of an alveolar stop.
Lesson 13: Fronting, Retroflexion, and Sibilants 157
Illustration 13.3: [t] Illustration 13.4: [ʈ]
Retroflexion occurs when the front of the tongue touches the hard pallet behind the
alveolar ridge. Retroflexed sounds are normally symbolized by adding a retroflexed hook
diacritic called the Right Tail [ ̢ ] to the base of an alveolar symbol. Therefore a voiced
retroflexed stop is symbolized by a Right-tail D [ɖ] and a voiceless retroflexed stop is a
Right-tail T [ʈ]. Illustrations 13.5 and 13.6 below depict the articulation of retroflexed
fricatives Right-tail S [ʂ] and Right-tail Z [ʐ].
Illustration 13.5: [ʂ] Illustration 13.6: [ʐ]
Affricates can also be retroflexed. Just as with fronting, the most common retroflexed
affricates are those in which both the stop and fricative are retroflexed.
158 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Producing Retroflexed Sounds
Because the tongue is naturally retroflexed for Rhotacized Schwa [ɚ], you can use this
sound to help with the articulation of other retroflexed consonants. Say the word “car”
slowly, exaggerating the [ɚ]. Many English speakers curl their tongue in a retroflexed
position for this sound. If you can feel that you do not retroflex your tongue automatically
during the [ɚ], then you must concentrate on doing so. It will come easier with [ɚ] than with
other consonants. Now say “car top” slowly, holding the position of the tongue for the [ɚ],
but closing your mouth until a stop is formed. You should produce a Right-tail T[ʈ]. Once
you can feel that you have achieved the retroflexed articulation, practice it with sentences one
and two of the following exercise. Then repeat the same process with the words “car seat” to
learn retroflexed fricatives.
Exercise 13.2: Producing Retroflexed Consonants
1. ʈen ʈan ʈrucks ʈook ʈerry’s ʈrash ʈo ʈown ʈoday.
2. ɖear ɖaɖɖy ɖon’ʈ ɖo thaʈ.
3. ʂiʂter ʂue ʂitʂ ʂewing ʂockʂ for ʂeaʂick ʂuffering ʂailorʂ.
4. ʐany ʐebraʂ ʐip and ʐoom.
Listen to the following exercises and determine whether each utterance contains a
retroflexed consonant or not. Many retroflexed sounds have a certain “r-like” quality that
also affects the surrounding vowels. This is one way to detect whether or not a sound is
retroflexed. Respond with “retroflexed” or “no.”

Sibilants
As you examine the new fricatives presented in the beginning of this lesson, you may
see two different fricatives that can be described as voiceless tip-dental fricatives, [θ] and [s̪].
We also see two different voiced tip-dental fricatives, [ð] and [z̪]. These sounds are not
160 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
identical, though. As you consider these pairs of consonants, you will notice that there are
some differences both in their articulation and in their sound.
Understanding Sibilants
One important distinction between these sounds is in the shape of the tongue. For the
sounds [θ] and [ð] the surface of the tongue is relatively flat, allowing air to escape evenly
along its entire width. These are called flat fricatives. The fricatives [s̪] and [z̪], on the other
hand, are pronounced with the sides of the tongue cupped slightly upward toward the roof of
the mouth. This forces the air to travel through a “channel,” or “trough,” down the center of
the tongue and exit near the tip. Fricatives made with this type of tongue configuration are
called sibilants. We say that sibilants have grooved articulation. Illustrations 13.7 and 13.8
show an head-on view of the tongue illustrating the distinction between flat fricatives and
sibilants.
Illustration 13.7: Flat Articulation Illustration 13.8: Grooved
Articulation
Producing Sibilants
Sibilants are usually characterized by a higher frequency hiss than flat fricatives. This
is because the air pressure is increased as the size of the exit is reduced. Repeat the fricative
pairs [θ] and [s] as well as [ð] and [z] to yourself and feel the difference in the air flow
restriction. You should also be able to identify the difference in the shape of the tongue.
You have already been producing the sounds involved in our discussion of sibilants,
and there are no new symbols to learn. You simply need to be aware of the different shapes
of the tongue and know how to identify fricatives of both types. The tip-dental, or fronted,
fricatives [s̪] and [z̪] are classified as sibilants since the tongue is grooved for their articulation.
They may be described as voiced/voiceless tip-dental sibilants, or voiced/voiceless tip-dental
grooved fricatives. The sounds [θ], [ð], [s̪], and [z̪] are included in the following exercise.
Respond with “flat” or “grooved.”

The vowel chart introduced in Lesson 12 organizes vowel qualities by their position
from front to back, by their height from close to open, and by the shape of the lips, either
rounded or unrounded. So far you have learned to recognize and reproduce [ɛ], [ɑ], and [o],
and some associated glides. This lesson will introduce additional vowel sounds and symbols
in the back and central positions.
Study the vowel symbols in the following chart. In English, some back vowels are
pronounced with rounded lips, while front and central vowels are pronounced with
unrounded lips. This same pattern does not apply to all languages, however. In French, for
example, many of the front vowels are rounded, while Vietnamese and Turkish have some
back, unrounded vowels. Any vowel may be either rounded or unrounded. In future lessons
you will learn to pronounce all of the basic vowels with either rounded or unrounded lips.
The bold symbols on the chart are the vowels focused on in this lesson.

The new sounds introduced in this lesson are U [u], Upsilon [ʊ], Open O [ɔ], and
Turned V [ʌ]. It is important to learn to pronounce these vowels with no glides. You may find
it helpful to watch your mouth in a mirror as you practice the sounds.
When pronouncing phonetic vowel sounds, you must remember that they may not
match up precisely with similar vowel sounds in your English speech. A vowel may be
pronounced differently by different speakers, and there can also be strong tendencies to glide

or slur the vowels. When using English words as pronunciation examples, you should
always check your pronunciation of the vowel sound in that word with your instructor.
The following facial diagrams illustrate the approximate position of the tongue during
the articulation of these new vowel sounds. It is important to note that the articulation of
vowels is less definable or clear cut than that of consonants. Facial diagrams may not always
be as accurate in portraying them. The following diagrams are included simply to give you a
general idea of what makes one vowel quality different from another. Remember that there
are hundreds of vowel possibilities. Altering the position of the tongue only slightly can
result in a different vowel sound.

166 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Recognizing [u] and [ʊ]
The symbol at the top right-hand side of the chart, in the close back rounded position,
is the U [u] corresponds to the vowel sound in the English word “boot” or “tooth.” There is
often a tendency to precede this vowel with the tongue in a lower or more central position
and then glide upward. It is important to keep the lips rounded and watch for glides such as
[əᵘ] or [ʊᵘ].
The Upsilon [ʊ] is a near-close near-back rounded vowel and corresponds to the vowel
in the word “book.” Again you must make sure your lips are rounded and your tongue is
near the back position. Some English speakers may say “book” with a central vowel [ə]. It
may help you to begin with [u] and then open your mouth slightly to get a pure [ʊ].
The following exercises will help you to distinguish between some of the new vowel
sounds. Listen to each pair of words and respond with “same” or “different.”

Recognizing [ɔ] and [ʌ]
The open-mid back unrounded vowel is called the Turned V [ʌ].1
It corresponds to the
vowel in the English words “pup” and “mud.” In order to eliminate any lip rounding, try
smiling while you say the vowel.
The Open O [ɔ] is the rounded counterpart to the Turned V. It is the vowel in the
English words “law” and “caught.”

Lesson 14: Back Vowels 171
Describing Back Vowels
Just like consonants, vowel qualities may also be described in terms of their
articulatory characteristics and conditions. A vowel’s technical name gives its position from
front to back, the height of the tongue, and the shape of the lips. The vowel [u], for instance, is
described as a close back rounded vowel. The vowel [ɑ] is an open back unrounded vowel.
Notice that the term for height is given first, followed by the vowel’s position and finally lip
rounding.
The following exercises will help you learn to describe vowels by giving their technical
names. Begin by telling whether the vowel you hear is rounded or unrounded. You may
look at the vowel chart at first if necessary. These exercises will include all of the vowels
introduced so far.
Exercise 14.15: Recognizing Rounded and Unrounded Vowels
1. [ʔɔ] Rounded
2. [ʔu] Rounded

15. [lɑd] Unrounded
16. [gʊm] Rounded
17. [bɛg] Unrounded
18. [mɔk] Rounded
In the following exercise, give the vowel’s position from front to back, as well as the
rounding of the vowel. Respond with “front unrounded,” “central unrounded,” or “back
rounded.”

176 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
In Lesson 1 we introduced the nasal manner of articulation. Nasal sounds are
produced when the articulator and point of articulation create a complete closure in the oral
cavity and the velic is open, allowing the air stream to pass through the nose. This results in a
sound that resonates more in the nasal cavity than the oral cavity. If the velic were to be
closed, the resulting consonant would be a stop. Nasal consonants usually involve very little
restriction of the air stream.
There are many different possibilities for nasal articulation. Any stop formed in the
oral cavity can be changed into a nasal by simply opening the velic. The following chart of
nasal consonants gives the new sounds that will be introduced in this lesson.

Introduction to Common Nasals
You are already familiar with the nasal consonants M [m], N [n], and to a lesser extent,
Eng [ŋ], all of which occur in English. M [m] is simply a bilabial nasal, and N [n] is an alveolar
nasal.
We will focus on some nasals with which you may not be so familiar. Remember that
good control over the velic is paramount when dealing with nasals. You must be able to open
and close your velic at will during any articulation. Try repeating the following sequences to
help gain control of your velic. During the following transitions between stops and nasals,
the position of the articulators and points of articulation do not change; only the velic opens
and closes.
Exercise 15.1: Controlling the Velic

2. [dndndndndn]
3. [gŋgŋgŋgŋgŋ]
Lesson 15: Nasals 177
Producing Initial Eng [ŋ]
The Eng [ŋ] is articulated by the back of the tongue contacting the velar point of
articulation. If you are a native English speaker, you have used this sound extensively in the
medial and final positions. However, its production in the initial position may be new to you,
since this sound never occurs at the beginning of an utterance in English. English speakers
trying to produce an initial [ŋ] have a tendency to put their tongue tip against the alveolar
ridge, resulting in [n]. Placing the tip of your tongue down behind your lower teeth while
pronouncing the [ŋ] can help you avoid this tendency.
To produce initial [ŋ], start by saying the word “singing,” and repeat the “ing” several
times. Then say the same sequence changing the stress placement to stress the [ŋ] rather than
the “i.” Now try to isolate the syllables to arrive at [ŋi]. This procedure is demonstrated in
the following exercise. Follow along in the text and repeat each utterance after the recording.
Exercise 15.2: Producing Initial [ŋ]
1. [ˈsiŋˈiŋˈiŋˈiŋˈiŋ]
2. [ˈsiˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi]
3. [ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi]
4. [ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi ˈŋi]
Repeat each of the following utterances after the recording.
Exercise 15.3: Producing Initial [ŋ]
1. a) [ŋɛ] b) [ɛŋɛ] c) [ŋɛŋɛ] d) [ŋɛŋɛŋ]
2. a) [ŋɑ] b) [ɑŋɑ] c) [ŋɑŋɑ] d) [ŋaŋɑŋ]
3. a) [ŋo] b) [oŋo] c) [ŋoŋo] d) [ŋoŋoŋ]
When pronouncing the [ŋ], many English speakers tend to close the velic before
actually releasing the nasal. This results in a nasal/stop sequence such as [ɑŋgɑ]. Listen to the
following exercise and try to detect the nasal/stop sequences. Respond with “nasal,” “stop,”
or “both.” Do not look at the text.

Producing [ñ]
The Enye [ñ] is produced when the blade of the tongue contacts the alveopalatal area.
This sound does not normally occur in English, but is quite prevalent in Spanish and many
other languages. It is used in the Spanish word “año” (year).
There is no official symbol for the alveopalatal nasal in IPA.1
The symbol presented in
this course, Enye [ñ], is an APA symbol, which is used widely for this sound. The diacritic
above the consonant is called a Tilde [ ̃].
The position of the tongue for [ñ] corresponds roughly with its position for [i]. Its
position is the same from front to back, but the tongue is higher for the nasal than it is for a
the vowel. If you begin with the vowel [i] and gradually close your mouth while keeping the
tongue in the same position from front to back, you should arrive at [ñ] once the articulator
and point of articulation meet. For this reason, the [ñ] is often accompanied by a palatal
approximant [j],2
which is similar in sound to an [i] glide, as the articulator moves either
toward or away from the articulation of [ñ]. Although this glided quality occurs quite
naturally, it is technically not a part of [ñ] articulation. It is safe to say, however, that in most
cases, the [ñ] will have a slight [i] sound associated with it. In this course, when the glided
quality is present, you will not be required to transcribe it.
Alveopalatal nasals are demonstrated in the following exercise both with and without
glides. Listen to the recording and mimic each utterance, paying specific attention to the
glides.
Exercise 15.5: Producing [ñ] With and Without Glides

4. [ɛñɛ]
5. [ɛñⁱɛ]
6. [ɛⁱñɛ]
7. [oño]
8. [oñⁱo]
9. [oⁱño]
Use Illustrations 15.1–15.3 to compare the articulations of [n], [ñ], and [ŋ]. You may also
use them as a reference point for the articulation of the new nasal. Notice how the tip of the
tongue is slightly lowered for [ñ] as the blade contacts the alveopalatal area.
1 Officially, the IPA interprets the Enye as a palatal nasal and symbolizes it as [ɲ]. An alveopalatal nasal is
officially symbolized in the IPA as a retracted alveolar nasal [n̠].
2 This, and other approximants, will be studied in detail in later chapters.
Lesson 15: Nasals 179
Illustration 15.1: [n] Illustration 15.2: [ñ] Illustration 15.3: [ŋ]
To produce [ñ], use the blade of your tongue to touch the alveopalatal area. Make sure
the tip of your tongue is down behind your lower teeth to prevent it from touching the

Fronted and Retroflexed Nasals
In Lesson 11 you learned that alveolar consonants are fronted by placing the tip of the
tongue firmly against the back of the upper teeth, and retroflexed consonants are articulated
by curling the tongue upward and slightly back. In this lesson, you will apply these
principles to the nasal manner of articulation to produce the sounds [n̪], and [ɳ].
Producing Fronted N [n̪]
The articulation of fronted N [n̪] corresponds to [d̪] presented in Lesson 11. The only
difference in articulation is that, for the nasal, the velic is open. Illustration 15.2 above depicts
the articulation of [n̪]. Try saying the words “ten things” [ˈtʰɛn̪.θiŋz]. Many English speakers
replace the alveolar [n] with a fronted nasal as they prepare for the dental fricative. When
producing fronted sounds, make sure that the tip of your tongue does not protrude past your
teeth.
180 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Producing Right-Tail N [ɳ]
A retroflexed nasal is represented by a symbol called Right-tail N [ɳ]. Notice that its
articulation is the same as [ɖ] except that the velic is open. Some English speakers might
retroflex the “n” in “doorknob” [ˈdo.ɳɑb]. If you do not feel retroflexed articulation in this
sequence, start with [ɖ] and then open the velic while holding the same articulation. Be
careful that you do not go too far and place the tip of the tongue at the palatal area.
Illustration 15.4: [n̪] Illustration 15.5: [n] Illustration 15.6: [ɳ]
The difference between fronted and alveolar nasals can be hard to hear, but the
distinction is important. The following recording demonstrates and contrasts [n̪], [n], and [ɳ]
in a sequence. The exercise will be given twice. Listen to the recording the first time and
mimic the second time.

Producing [ɱ]
The symbol for labiodental nasals is a lowercase “M” with a left tail on its right leg.
Some linguists call it Meng [ɱ] (pronounced [miŋ]). Labiodental nasals are less common than
most other nasals. When they do occur, they usually precede a labiodental fricative like [f] or
[v]. In such cases, the articulation of the nasal is being modified to conform to the articulation
of the fricative. English speakers often say the words “comfort” and “circumvent” with [ɱ]
rather than [m].
To produce the voiced labiodental nasal [ɱ], put your lower lip and upper teeth in
position for [v] and say “mama.” Make sure that your velic is open and the air stream does
not exit through your mouth. You may also prolong [m] while gradually moving your lower
lip backward to the dental position. Repeat the following utterances after the recording.
Exercise 15.11: Producing [ɱ]
1. [vɑvɑvɑvɑvɑ]
2. [vɑɱɑvɑɱɑvɑɱɑvɑɱɑvɑɱɑ]
3. [ɱɑɱɑɱɑɱɑɱɑ]
Although the voiceless labiodental nasal appears on the nasal chart, it rarely, if ever,
regularly occurs in any actual language. Some English speakers could pronounce the [ɱ̊] in
rapid speech instead of [m] when followed by a voiceless labiodental fricative [f], for example,
“comfort” [ˈkʌɱ̊.fɝt].
Lesson 15: Nasals 183
Voiceless Nasals
For every voiced nasal, it is possible to articulate a voiceless counterpart. Voiceless
nasals are found in many languages throughout the world. They often occur immediately
before or after voiced nasals of the same point of articulation. However, in some languages
they can occur alone just as any other consonant.
An Under-ring [  ̥ ] beneath a nasal symbol indicates that the nasal is voiceless. If the
symbol has a descender, like [ŋ], an Over-ring [  ̊] is placed above it, such as [ŋ̊].
Voiceless nasals are produced by simply controlling the glottis, or vocal cords. It
involves nothing more than blowing air through the nose during the articulation of a given
nasal consonant. Consider the English interjection “Hmmm.” The [h] sound at the beginning
of this utterance is actually a voiceless bilabial nasal if the lips are closed and the air escapes
through the nose. Repeat this interjection to yourself several times and notice that the only
thing that changes between the so-called “h” and the “mmm” is the voicing. You must not
confuse voiceless nasals with [h], however. In a nasal the entire air stream exits through the
nasal cavity, while with [h] it exits through the oral cavity. If you have trouble telling whether
a voiceless sound is a nasal or not, try holding your nose while saying the sound. If the air
stream is entirely stopped, the sound is a nasal.
Say the following English interjections several times and then replace the [m] with
other nasals. Repeat each utterance after the recording.
Exercise 15.12: Producing Voiceless Nasals
1. a) [m̥m] b) [n̥n] c) [ñ̥ñ] d) [ŋ̊ŋ]
2. a) [m̥mʔm] b) [n̥nʔn] c) [ñ̥ñʔñ] d) [ŋ̊ŋʔŋ]
3. a) [ʔmm̥m] b) [ʔnn̥n] c) [ʔññ̥ñ] d) [ʔŋŋ̊ŋ]
You must be able to pronounce voiceless nasals without their voiced counterparts.
Some speakers may find this difficult at first. The following exercise will help you to hear the
difference between voiceless nasals and voiced/voiceless combinations. Respond with
“voiced,” “voiceless,” or “both.”

This lesson introduces more vowels in the front position. All of the vowels in this
lesson are unrounded. You will not be required to learn much new terminology since you are
already familiar with the terms for vowel height and position. We will simply add a few new
symbols and sounds to fill in the empty positions on the chart.
As we work with more vowel sounds, remember that we cannot claim absolute
precision in the articulation and position of a given vowel since there is always a small
amount of variation in their pronunciation. With the vowel chart we are dealing more with
how vowel sounds are perceived than exactly how they are produced.
Illustration 16.1: Front and Near-Front Vowels
The bold symbols on the chart, [i], [ɪ], [e], and [æ] are the front vowel sounds
introduced in this lesson. They are quite similar to many English sounds, but you must
produce them without the glides and modifications that are native to most dialects of English.
English front vowels are often produced slightly farther back than the true front position, and
[i] is usually produced slightly more open than a true [i] vowel as well. You must be aware of
these habits before you can begin to produce phonetically pure vowel sounds. The emphasis
throughout the remainder of this course is the production of unglided vowels unless a glide is
specifically indicated in the transcription.
Illustration 16.1 indicates the approximate tongue position for the four vowels [i], [ɪ],
[e], and [æ]. Notice that the tip is not the highest part of the tongue for front vowels. The tip
is usually just behind or against the lower teeth. This diagram shows only the different
positions of the tongue and not that of the other facial features. In reality the entire lower jaw
moves with the tongue for each different vowel.

Lesson 16: Front Vowels 189
Illustration 16.2: [i], [ɪ], [e], and
[æ]
Producing [i]
The close front unrounded vowel I [i] corresponds to the vowel sound in the words
“bee” and “tea.” As we have already mentioned, many English speakers do not pronounce [i]
as high or as far forward as it should be. With [i], we are striving for articulation as high and
as front as possible for a vowel sound. You must also make sure that you do not pronounce
this vowel as [ɪⁱ], as is often the tendency. Practice saying [i] with no vowel glide and as far
forward as possible.
The following exercise will help you learn to recognize [i]. Listen to the recording and
respond with “same” or “different.”
Exercise 16.1: Recognizing [i] and [ɪ]

you hear a glide and “no” if you hear a pure vowel.

5. [pʰiz] No
6. [xif] No
7. [tʰiks] No
8. [pʰɪⁱz] Glide
9. [fist] No
Producing [ɪ]
The near-close near-front unrounded vowel is represented by a Small Capital I [ɪ] and
corresponds to the vowel sound in the words “bit” and “stick.” You must be careful not to
produce the [ɪ] with a [ə] off-glide, such as many English speakers do in the word “bit” [bɪət].
To practice recognizing the Small Capital I, listen to the next exercise and respond with
“same” or “different.” Do not follow along in the text.
Exercise 16.3: Recognizing [ɪ] and [e]
1. [ʔɪ ʔe] Different
2. [gɪf gɪf] Same
3. [mɪd mɪd] Same
4. [nek nɪk] Different
5. [ʔɪt ʔet] Different
6. [sef sɪf] Different

9. [bɪte bɪte] Same
10. [nɑkɛ nɑkɪ] Different
11. [sofɪ sofɪ] Same
12. [tikɪ tiki] Different
A Small Capital I [ɪ] pronounced with a [ə] off-glide can often be difficult to distinguish
from a pure [ɪ] sound. This next exercise will contrast glided [ɪ] with pure [ɪ]. Each word will
be given twice. The first time the word will contain a pure vowel. The second word will
include a [ə] off-glide. Follow the transcription.

10. [zɪə

11. [ðɪə
m] Glide
12. [hɪn] No
Producing [e]
The close-mid front unrounded vowel E [e] is similar to the sound in the words “bait”
and “mate.” This vowel is one of the hardest for English speakers to produce as a pure vowel
since it virtually never occurs as such in English. It is usually accompanied by a strong [i]
off-glide. To produce this vowel correctly, say “bay,” and make sure that your mouth does
not close to the [i] position. Your tongue must remain stationary throughout the articulation
of the vowel to eliminate the glide. Practice saying [e] without gliding to another vowel.
Listen to the difference between glided [eⁱ] and pure [e] in the following exercise. Each
word will be given twice. The English pronunciation will be given first and then be followed
by a pure vowel. Watch your mouth in a mirror.
Exercise 16.6: Recognizing [eⁱ] and [e]

15. [gedʒ] No
Producing [æ]
Ash [æ]1
is a near-open front unrounded vowel. It corresponds to the vowel sound in
the words “bat” and “sad.” English speakers normally produce this vowel with a [ə]
off-glide. Although this is not a characteristic of all dialects, you should still be aware of this
tendency and strive to produce a pure Ash.
The next exercise compares [æ] with other similar vowels. Respond with “same” or
“different.”

1. [fæʃ fæʃ] Same
2. [sæv sɛv] Different

10. [ʃæk ʃɑk] Different
11. [tæp tɑp] Different
12. [mæg mæg] Same
1 Ash [æ] has also been called Digraph; however, technically, a digraph is a combination of two unconnected
symbols. The Ash [æ] therefore is not a digraph but a ligature of an “a” and an “e.”
Lesson 16: Front Vowels 193
To produce a pure [æ], you must learn to produce it without a [ə] off-glide. The
following exercise demonstrates this glide in English words. The first time a word is given it
will contain a pure vowel. The second time it will be glided. Follow along in the text.

200 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
The lateral manner of articulation involves air passing by one or both sides of the
tongue rather than over its center. If you examine the position of your tongue during the
word-initial lateral in the words “log” and “leaf,” you will notice that the tip of your tongue
touches the alveolar ridge but the air stream is allowed to escape relatively freely past its
sides. The most common lateral is the [l] such as in the words listed above.
Table 17.1 introduces the symbols for the lateral sounds discussed in this lesson. This
chart is by no means exhaustive. Additional voiceless and retroflexed variations which are
less common will be presented in later chapters.

Lateral Approximants
Laterals are classified as either approximants or fricatives. An approximant is a sound
produced when an articulator approaches near enough to a point of articulation to redirect
the air stream, but does not significantly restrict it. Approximants differ from fricatives in
that there is no audible turbulence produced by the articulator. The lateral sounds in the
words “log” and “leaf” are approximants because the air stream is not audibly restricted.
The articulation of approximants is not as open as that of vowels, however, since the air
stream is narrowed or reduced somewhat. The most common laterals are approximants.
Alveolar Laterals
The lateral chart above contains two laterals at the alveolar position. These two laterals
are produced at the same point of articulation, but with slightly different tongue configura-
Lesson 17: Laterals 201
tions. Both of these laterals occur in English, but in different environments. Clear L [l], also
simply called L [l], is articulated with the tip or blade of the tongue against the alveolar ridge
and the back of the tongue lowered to a neutral position. This lateral is also called the high
tongue L by some linguists because the blade of the tongue remains high, close to the
alveopalatal area before dropping down in the back. The Clear L is the principle lateral in
Spanish and French. Clear L occurs in English word initially and when followed by a close
front vowel, such as in the word “leaf.” The Dark L [ɫ], also called velarized or
pharyngealized L, is also articulated with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge, but
unlike Clear L, the back of the tongue is raised to some degree at the velar position. This
tongue configuration, called velarization, will be dealt with more thoroughly in another
lesson. This lateral is also called Low Tongue L because the blade of the tongue is lowered
away from the alveopalatal area before being raised in the back. It often occurs word final in
English, such as in the word “pool.” Illustration 17.1 and Illustration 17.2 depict the different
tongue configurations of Clear L and Dark L.
Illustration 17.1: [l] Illustration 17.2: [ɫ]
The following exercise demonstrates Clear L and Dark L with common English words.
As you listen for the different sound qualities, you will notice that the Clear L may have a
certain “Spanish sound” associated with it. Follow along in the text to familiarize yourself
with the symbols. Clear L will be given first and Dark L second.

8. [læb ɫæb]
9. [lup ɫup]
10. [pʰul pʰuɫ]
To pronounce Clear L [l], make sure that the blade of your tongue stays high and near
(but not touching) the alveopalatal area. You can accomplish this by saying [l] and [i] at the
same time. The back of your tongue will naturally drop to a neutral position. As we have
mentioned before, most English speakers use [l] at the beginning of the word “leaf.” Some
people also use [l] when saying William. Say these words and isolate the laterals, keeping
your tongue in the correct position. You may also try using a Spanish accent to reach the
articulation of [l].
Dark L [ɫ] occurs at the end of words or syllables in the speech of most English
speakers. You can feel its articulation by saying the word “pool” and prolonging the lateral at
the end. You can also try saying [l] and [ʌ] at the same time. This will automatically give the
correct tongue contour for [ɫ].
In many languages, such as Spanish and French, the Dark L does not occur. English
speakers have a tendency to insert the Dark L at the end of words when speaking these
languages. While the English speaker may be unaware of the difference, this marks his
speech with a distracting accent. Practice the pronunciation of [l] and [ɫ] in the following
exercise. Mimic each utterance.

Producing [l̪] and [ɭ]
Just like other alveolar consonants that we have studied, laterals can be both fronted
and retroflexed. It should not be difficult to produce these variations since you are already
familiar with the concepts of fronting and retroflexion. Alveolar laterals are the only fronted
and retroflexed sounds presented in this lesson, although these variations of other laterals are
possible as well.
The fronted lateral is represented by adding a diacritic called a Bridge [ ̪] below the
symbol [l̪]. A retroflexed lateral is symbolized by the addition of a Right Hook [ ̢ ] below the
symbol. This symbol is known as Right-tail L [ɭ].
Practice your recognition of fronted and retroflexed laterals in the following exercise.
Respond with “fronted,” “alveolar,” or “retroflexed.”

The Alveopalatal Lateral [l]
The blade-alveopalatal lateral, commonly known as Retracted L [l], corresponds with
the articulation of Enye [ñ]. Although this sound does not occur in normal English speech, it
should not be too difficult to produce as you are already used to the articulation of the
alveopalatal nasal.
Since the position of the tongue for an alveopalatal lateral [l] is only slightly higher
than [i], it is often accompanied by an [i] glide at its onset or release. You can learn to
204 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
articulate [l] by beginning with the vowel [i] and gradually closing your mouth until the blade
of the tongue touches the alveopalatal point of articulation. Remember to keep the tip of your
tongue tucked behind you lower teeth so that it doesn’t cause you to say [l]. You can also start
with [ñ] and switch to lateral articulation for [l].
The alveopalatal lateral [l] is often confused with Clear L. Listen for and mimic the
difference between [ɫ], [l], and [l] in the following exercise.

Velar Lateral [ʟ]
The Small Capital L [ ]
ʟ is articulated with the back of the tongue at the velar point of
articulation. Do not confuse the velar lateral [ʟ] with the velarized lateral [ɫ]. The velarized
lateral’s primary articulation is between the tip of the tongue and the alveolar ridge. English
has few, if any, examples of velar laterals. Some speakers may use a velar lateral in words like
“milk” and “bulk” as the back-velar stop pulls the lateral farther back. More commonly, the
tongue approaches the velar point of articulation but does not actually touch it. This pro-
duces a type of approximant which we will discuss in a later lesson.
Lesson 17: Laterals 205
To learn the articulation for Small Capital L [ʟ], say words that start with “gl,” such as
“glue” and “glean.” Make sure that the tip of your tongue stays down behind your lower
teeth as you release the back velar stop into a lateral. Lengthen the lateral and then isolate it
to arrive at Small Capital L [ʟ]. The following exercise demonstrates this process. Listen to
the exercise first, and then mimic it.

2. a) [gʟin] b) [gʟːin] c) [ʟːin] d) [ʟː] e) [ɑʟɑ]
Voiceless Laterals
By controlling the glottis, we can produce any lateral sound as either voiced or
voiceless. Every voiced lateral has a voiceless counterpart. The audible difference between
most voiceless laterals, however, is very slight. The only voiceless lateral approximants
studied in this course are voiceless Clear L [l̥] and voiceless Small Capital L [ʟ̥]. Voiceless
lateral fricatives will be discussed later.
In English, voiceless laterals are often found after voiceless aspirated stops. You can
learn to articulate them by isolating them in those instances. The following exercise demon-
strates [l̥] in common English words. The [ʟ̥] does not naturally occur in these words, but you
can learn its articulation in the drill. Listen to the words, and practice them until you can hear
and produce the voiceless [l̥].

Lateral Fricatives
Some laterals involve an audible restriction of the air stream. These laterals are classi-
fied as lateral fricatives. Lateral fricatives differ from other fricatives in that the center or tip
of the tongue is raised to touch the point of articulation while the sides remain open allowing
the air to escape. The shape of the tongue is exactly opposite from that of sibilants. Remem-
ber that sibilants are a type of fricative for which the sides of the tongue are raised and the air
is channeled over the center. The following illustrations show a head-on view of the shape of
the tongue for sibilants, flat fricatives, and laterals.
Lesson 17: Laterals 207
Illustration 17.3:
Sibilant [s]
Illustration 17.4:
Flat [θ]
Illustration 17.5:
Lateral [l]
The voiceless lateral fricative is symbolized by a symbol called Belted L [ɬ]. The voiced
lateral fricative is represented by ligature of an L [l] and an Ezh [ʒ], sometimes referred to as
Lezh [ɮ] or L-Ezh ligature.
Producing [ɬ] and [ɮ]
The articulation of lateral fricatives differs from that of lateral approximants only in
that the openings where the air escapes along the sides of the tongue are restricted enough to
cause audible turbulence. You can learn to pronounce the voiced, tip-alveolar lateral fricative
[ɮ] by lengthening [lː] and gradually reducing the size of the air stream’s outlet until you get
friction. You may also try keeping your tongue somewhat relaxed while saying [lː], and
applying greater force with the lungs. English speakers with a lisp will sometimes use [ɮ] is
place of [z] in words like “zebra” and “zone.”
To produce the voiceless tip-alveolar lateral fricative [ɬ], say a lengthened voiceless [l̥]
and gradually close off the air stream’s outlet until you get friction. People with a lisp will
often use [ɬ] in place of [s] or [ʃ] in words like “sunshine” and “sleepy.”
The following exercise demonstrates the production of [ɬ] and [ɮ]. Listen to each

Lateral Affricates
In Lesson 9 we explained how stops can be released into fricatives to produce sound
combinations that we call affricates. We have already dealt with stops released into flat
fricatives and sibilants. Stops can also be released into lateral fricatives, creating lateral
affricates. The table of phonetic symbols at the beginning of this lesson gives the lateral
affricates which we will drill in this lesson. There are several other lateral affricate possibilit-
ies not listed, which include fronted and retroflexed affricates. These affricates are entirely
possible, though not as common.
The stop/lateral combination [dl] is also very common in languages throughout the
world, but this consonant cluster is not technically an affricate since the lateral release is an
approximant and not a fricative.
Lesson 17: Laterals 209
The tip-alveolar lateral affricates [tɬ] and [dɮ] are produced quite easily. Simply
articulate for the stop and then, while keeping the tip of your tongue against the alveolar
ridge, lower the sides of your tongue to produce the lateral fricative. This same procedure
applies for both voiced and voiceless affricates.
The velar-alveolar affricates [kɬ] and [gɮ] are produced by articulating the back-velar
stop and tip-alveolar lateral at the same time so that when the stop is released, the lateral is
already in articulation. The following exercise demonstrates lateral affricates. Listen to the
sounds and mimic each utterance.

The next exercise contains various stop/lateral combinations. Tell whether the
combination in each utterance is an affricate or not. Remember that both the stop and

or “no.”

This lesson introduces two new vowel sounds as well as a new phonetic concept called
length. The vowels presented here will complete the number of open vowels drilled in this
course.
Open Vowels
The new vowel sounds introduced in this lesson occur in English, but with less fre-
quency than the other vowels we have studied. Their use is usually limited to certain dialects
or phonetic environments. The open front unrounded vowel [a] is only found in diphthongs
in most English dialects. Words like “how,” “now,” and “about” contain a [aᵘ] diphthong.
Southern US dialects also tend to use the [a] in words like “I” and “pie”; whereas, the vowel
and glide combination [ɑⁱ] or [ʌⁱ] is the standard pronunciation.1
The open back unrounded
vowel [ɒ] is often used in British dialects of English, and in some American dialects as well.
They are often found in words like “our” and “father.” The [ɒ] also may be used in place of
the Open O [ɔ] in rapid speech, as in the word “call.”
The bold symbols in the vowel chart below represent the new sounds introduced in
this lesson. The difficulties in learning these sounds will be depend upon the individual’’s
speech patterns. Some individuals will already produce one or both of these vowels in their
normal speech, while others will have to work harder to learn them.
Illustration 18.1: Open Vowels
1 In standard American English, the diphthong [ʌⁱ] occurs before voiceless consonants, such as “ice” [ʌⁱs], and
[ɑⁱ] occurs in all other environments, such as “eyes” [ɑⁱz] or “I” [ɑⁱ].

Lesson 18: Open Vowels and Length 215
Illustration 18.1 shows the approximate tongue position for both [a] and [ɒ]. Notice
that the tongue is low for both sounds, but its highest point is in the front for [a] and in the
back for [ɒ]. Also, the note that the lips were removed because [a] is unrounded, but [ɒ] is
rounded.
Illustration 18.2: [a] and [ɒ]
Producing [a]
The open, front unrounded vowel is called Lowercase A [a]. The [a] is difficult to
isolate because English speakers normally glide [a] to [u]. One way to learn this vowel is to
imagine being injured and say a lengthened, “ow!” Another way to learn this vowel is to
imitate a southerner as he says “I want a piece of pie.” This sound is also prevalent in a
Bostonian accent. You may try to imitate a Bostonian as he says, “Park your car in Harvard
Yard.” You must make sure that you do not use [æ] or [ɑ].
The following exercise demonstrates the vowels Ash [æ], Lowercase A [a], and Script A
[ɑ] in sentences. Notice that Lowercase A is somewhere between Ash and Script A. Follow
the transcription and repeat each utterance after the recording.

13. [ðan] Lowercase A
14. [ðæn] Ash
15. [ðan] Lowercase A
Producing [ɒ]
The open back unrounded vowel is called Turned [ɒ]. This vowel’s sound is some-
where between [ɔ] and [ɑ]. To learn to produce the Turned A, say each vowel going down the
back rounded column of the chart. Begin at the close, back rounded position and open your
mouth a little wider for each sound until you reach the articulation for [ɒ]. The amount of lip
rounding decreases as you approach the open position. For [ɒ], the lips should be nearly
unrounded. Make sure, though, that your articulation is farther back than [ɑ]. You can also
follow the same procedure beginning with the Ash and working your way back from a front
unrounded position to a back unrounded position.

Length
When we speak of length linguistically, we refer to the duration of time for which the
articulation of a sound is held. Nearly all sounds can vary in length. Continuants like
vowels, nasals, laterals, and fricatives can be prolonged until the speaker is out of breath.
Voiced stops, on the other hand, can be lengthened only until the chambers behind the articu-
lator fill with air so that the air flow through the vocal cords is stopped. Voiceless stops can
also be held for a brief period of time, but are inaudible until they are released. Flaps, which
we will introduce in a later lesson, cannot be lengthened. When the articulation of a flap is
held, it automatically becomes a different manner of articulation.
Do not confuse phonetically long and short vowels with the traditional English defini-
tion of long and short vowels. In English phonics you learned that the word “bait” contains a
long vowel sound, while “bat” contains a short one. This is merely a difference in vowel
quality and not of the duration of time that the sound is held. In phonetics, the terms “long”
and “short” refer to the length of time that a sound is continued.
The length of a phonetic segment is relative to the length of the surrounding segments.
In other words, to tell whether a sound is long or short, it must be compared to the length of
adjacent sounds. In an utterance there is usually an average slot of time allotted for each
sound. This determines the normal length for sounds within that utterance. A lengthened
sound simply occupies more than one normal beat.
The official way to symbolize length in the IPA is to use a pair of triangles called a
Length Mark [ː]. A colon [:] is also used because of its practicality when typing. When three
degrees of lengthening are present, a Half-length Mark [ˑ] is used to symbolize the degree of
length between normal and full lengthening. If a sound is extra short, a Breve [  ̆] is placed
above the symbol. The Double-length Mark [ːː] is used to indicate extra long phones.
Nearly all languages have examples of sounds which vary perceptibly in length. In
some English dialects, vowels may have three different degrees of lengthening. Consider the
words “bee,” “bead,” and “beat.” All three of these words represent vowels with different
lengths. The [iː] in “bee” is the longest, the [iˑ] in “bead” is half-long, and the [i] in “beat” is
220 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
the shortest. This difference of vowel length is dependent upon whether the vowel comes
before a voiceless consonant, a voiced consonant, or no consonant at all. There are no two
English words that have a different meaning based only on vowel length. Therefore, length
in English is not contrastive, meaning that it never makes a difference in the meaning of a
word. In many other languages, however, the length of vowels is contrastive. In Khmu ,
ʔ
length is the only difference between [dɛk], meaning “little,” and [dɛːk], meaning “flush at the
end.”
The following exercise demonstrates three different degrees of lengthening on vowels.
Follow along in the text and mimic each utterance as it builds up from a normal vowel to a
fully lengthened one. Make sure that you do not change the vowel quality between the long
and short vowels.

[mitːæ] meaning “measurement.” The following exercise demonstrates lengthened conson-

224 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
We have so far dealt only with stops, fricatives, nasals, and laterals. These manners of
articulation involve a consciously controlled interaction between the articulator and point of
articulation. In a stop, for instance, the articulator approaches the point of articulation,
contacts it, and then is released in a concise movement. Flaps and trills are much less
deliberate. Instead, they involve quick, flicking movements of a loosely held articulator
against the point of articulation. The articulator actually only touches the point of articulation
for a very brief period of time. In other ways, however, flaps and trills are articulated much
the same as corresponding stops, nasals, or laterals.
Table 19.1 lists the symbols of the flaps and Table 19.2 lists the symbols of trills that will
be introduced in this lesson. The uvular point of articulation is the only point that has not
been previously drilled in this course.

The above chart of flapped and trilled sounds is not exhaustive. Many other
consonants, including some fricatives, can be flapped by simply articulating them very
rapidly. Fronted variations of the consonants above can also be flapped. Although these
sounds are entirely possible, they are not found very frequently in languages. We have
chosen the most common flaps to study here. To symbolize flapped phones that do not have
Lesson 19: Flaps and Trills 225
a special symbol, place a Breve [ ̆] above the consonant symbol, such as [n̆]. Just like with
voweks, Breves indicate extra short articulation.
We will not present facial diagrams of most of the sounds discussed in this lesson since
the static nature of the diagrams makes them incapable of showing the correct movement
involved in a flap or trill. In a static representation, most flaps would look just like a stop or
nasal.

As we have already explained, the articulation of flaps is very similar to that of their
corresponding stops, nasals, and laterals.1
The main difference is that a flap is articulated
with a quick, flicking movement of the articulator. In some environments, English speakers
naturally replace stops with flaps when speaking quickly. If you were to say the sequence
“bitter better butter battle” as fast as you could, you would notice that for each [t], the tongue
barely touches the point of articulation before it bounces away again, creating an alveolar
flap. The symbol for the alveolar flap is an “r” without the serif at the top and is commonly
referred to as the Fish-hook R [ɾ].2
A retroflexed flap is symbolized by a symbol called the
Right-tail R [ɽ]. Listen to the next exercise as it demonstrates common English words, first
with stops and then with flaps.

1 Another term that may be encountered is taps. Many linguists use the terms flaps and taps interchangeably;
however, some make a distinction between the two. These linguists contend that the articulator briefly
touches the point of articulation when pronouncing a tap; whereas, when pronouncing a flap, the articulator
moves toward the point of articulation but does not make contact. Linguists who make this distinction use
the Fish-hook R [ɾ] to indicate a tip-alveolar tap and a small capital D [ᴅ] to indicate a tip-alveolar flap. For
the purposes of this textbook, no distinction will be made between flaps and taps, and only the term flap(s)
will be used in the text.
2 Although the alveolar flap [ɾ] is called a Fish-hook R, it sounds much more like the English “d” than it does
the English “r.”
226 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Producing [ɾ] and [ɽ]
There are three different ways in which the tongue can move for flapped sounds
produced at the alveolar ridge. If you say the word “Betty” [ˈbɛ.ɾi], you will notice that the tip
of the tongue taps the alveolar ridge and then returns straight back down to its original
position. If you say the word “Saturday” [ˈsæ.ɾɚ.ɽeⁱ], you will notice that for the first flap,
the tongue flicks past the alveolar ridge as it moves backward. For the second flap [ɽeⁱ], the
tongue flicks past the alveolar ridge as it moves toward the front of the mouth. These tongue
movements are illustrated in the following diagram. Repeat each example word and see if
you can feel the different types of movement.
Illustration 19.1:
Vertical Flap
Movement
Illustration 19.2:
Backward Flap
Movement
Illustration 19.3:
Forward Flap
Movement
In Illustration 19.1, the tongue taps the alveolar ridge and comes straight back down as
in the word [ˈbɛ.ɾi]. In Illustration 19.2, the tongue flicks the alveolar ridge as it moves
backward as in [ˈsæ.ɾɚ]. The tongue also flicks by the alveolar ridge as it moves forward in
[ɽeⁱ]. You can learn to control the articulation of Fish-hook R [ɾ] by speeding up the
pronunciation of certain practice words. Try saying “tada” [tʰəˈdɑ] several times increasing
the speed until you get [tɾɑ]. Practice the same procedure with [gəˈdɑ] and [dəˈdɑ].
Remember to relax the tip of your tongue a bit so that it can move freely. You may also try
saying the words “auto” and “patty” quickly with a relaxed tongue.
Mimic the Fish-hook R [ɾ] in the following exercise. Remember not to try to control the
articulation too much. A tightly controlled tongue will result in a stop instead of a flap.

It can often be difficult to tell whether a sound is a flap or a stop. Remember that
during the articulation of a stop, there is a buildup of pressure behind the articulator. There
is no such pressure buildup with a flap, since the articulation is rapid and the tongue is
somewhat relaxed. The following exercise contains both flaps and stops. Listen to each
utterance and identify the manner of articulation. Respond with “flap” or “stop.”

The difference between Fish-hook R [ɾ] and Right-tail R [ɽ] is the retroflexing of the
tongue, and while the difference may be slight, being able to differentiate these sounds is
necessary in some languages. Practice identifying these sounds in the following exercise.
Respond with “alveolar” or “retroflexed.”

The articulation of the Right-tail R [ɽ] is noticeably different from the articulation of the
“r” sound in English, which is a glide symbolized by a Turned R [ɹ]. Although this sound has
not yet been formally introduced, it should easy to differentiate these two sounds. Respond
with “flap” or “approximant” in the following exercise.

Voiceless Flaps
All voiced flaps have voiceless counterparts; however, due to the short duration of
flaps, it can be difficult to eliminate the voicing between two vowels. Most English speakers
exclusively use voiced flaps. Consider the words “latter” and “ladder.” In standard
American English, both of these words are pronounced [ˈlæ.ɾɚ]. Remember that
voicelessness is represented by placing an Under-ring [  ̥ ] beneath a symbol or an Over-ring
[  ̊] above a symbol that has a descender.
Producing voiceless flaps is simply a matter of controlling the glottis. In order to
eliminate the voicing, try saying [h] while articulating the flap. This section will focus on the
alveolar and retroflexed flaps.
The following exercise demonstrates [ɾ̥]. Mimic each utterance after the recording,
paying particular attention to your voicing.

10. [ʊɽ̊ʊ] Retroflexed
11. [æɾ̥æ] Alveolar
12. [ɑɽ̊ɑ] Retroflexed
Producing Nasal and Lateral Alveolar Flaps
Most linguists agree that flapped nasals and laterals are simply nasals and laterals of
extremely short duration. The only particular difficulty that most English speakers have in
producing these flaps is in relaxing the tongue to the point that it can flap instead of creating
an ordinary nasal or lateral consonant.
No special symbol has been decided upon by linguists to represent an alveolar nasal
flap, so the Breve [  ̆] above an “n” is commonly used. The alveolar lateral flap, on the other
hand, has been given a symbol called the Turned Long-leg R [ɺ].3
You can feel the Flapped N [n̆] by saying the words “Minnie” and “penny” very
rapidly. To pronounce a lateral flap [ɺ], quickly say the words “Millie” and “valley.” Make
sure that you do not insert [ɾ] in place of the nasals and laterals.
Listen to the nasal and lateral sounds in the following exercise and respond with
“flapped” or “no.”
Exercise 19.9: Recognizing Flaps
1. [ɑɺɑ] Flapped 2. [ɑlɑ] No 3. [ɑn̆ɑ] Flapped
3 Even though the symbol chosen to represent a lateral flap [ɺ] is a modified “r,” this phone has no inherit r-like
quality.

13. [tɑɺɑp] Flapped
14. [ɑlɑps] No

Labiodental Flaps [ⱱ]
The final flap that will be introduced in this lesson is the labiodental flap, which is
symbolized by combining a V [v] with the Fish-hook R [ɾ] into a symbol called Right Hook V
[ⱱ].4
This phone is quite rare, being restricted to a few African languages.
The labiodental flap is articulated by the lower lip flicking outward briefly striking the
upper teeth. When repeating the following utterances, be careful not to accidentally
pronounce a [b]. As with all flaps, the articulator must flick past the point of articulation
quickly.

2. [ⱱɑⱱɑⱱɑⱱɑⱱɑ]
3. [fɑfɑfɑfɑfɑ]
4. [ⱱ̥ɑⱱ̥ɑⱱ̥ɑⱱ̥ɑⱱ̥ɑ]
Trills
A trill is a rapid series of vibrations of an articulator against a point of articulation.
These vibrations are not brought about by controlled muscular movements. Instead, the
pressure of the air stream passing between the articulator and the point of articulation causes
the articulator to “flutter” back and forth. Some linguists describe the articulator during a
trill as “flapping in the breeze.” It is important to realize that the articulator must be relaxed
for this to occur. A trill cannot be produced by consciously trying to articulate a quick series
of stops or flaps. The muscles serve only to hold the articulator in the correct position so that
the passing air will cause it to flutter against the point of articulation.
4 Another symbol for labiodental flaps that may be encountered is the V with curl [ⱴ]. A voiceless labiodental
flap can be symbolized either by placing an under-ring below the right hook V [ⱱ̥] or by adding a breve above
an “f” [f̆].
Lesson 19: Flaps and Trills 231
Alveolar Trills [r]
The alveolar trill is symbolized simply by a Lowercase R [r].5
Many people are already
able to produce the alveolar trill [r]. This sound is commonly made by children when
imitating machine guns, cars, or airplanes. However, if you have trouble with this trill, you
can learn to produce it by repeating “butter up” faster and faster until you get [brʌp]. Some
people will find it easier to learn [r] after [p]. Do the same procedure with the phrase “put it
on” so that you get [prɑn]. Remember to relax the tip of your tongue so that the air stream can
cause it to flutter.
To produce the voiceless tip-alveolar trill [r̥], practice the same phrases as above, only
this time in a whisper.
Once you have learned the articulation of [r] and [r̥], mimic the trills in the following
exercise.
Exercise 19.11: Producing [r] and [r̥]
1. a) [ɑrɑ] b) [rɑrɑr] c) [ɑr̥ɑ] d) [r̥ɑr̥ɑr̥]

Bilabial Trills [ʙ]
The bilabial trill [ʙ] and voiceless bilabial trill [ʙ̥] may be less common than most other
trills, so we will not spend a great deal of time on it in this course. They are symbolized by a
Small Capital B [ʙ]. However, it does occur in some languages, so you should be familiar
with its articulation. It should not be particularly difficult to produce if you keep your lips
relaxed. Many times people say a lengthened bilabial trill [ʙː] to indicate that they are
shivering. You can also produce [ʙ̥] by imitating the voiceless snort of a horse. Try saying the
following sequences.

2. a) [ʙ̥ɑ] b) [ɑʙ̥] c) [ɑʙ̥ɑ] d) [ʙ̥ɑʙ̥ɑʙ̥]
Uvular Trills [ʀ]
A uvular trill may prove difficult for some English speakers, as it is produced as the
uvula flutters against the back of the tongue, creating a sound almost like gargling.
The symbol for a uvular trill is called Small Capital R [ʀ]. Illustration 19.3 shows the
position of the tongue and uvula during a uvular trill.
Lesson 19: Flaps and Trills 233
Illustration 19.4: Uvular
Trill
To produce the uvular trill, start with [ɣ] and gradually move your tongue back until
you feel the uvula begin to vibrate against the back of the tongue. You may have to practice
this several times until you can get a smooth trilling sound. You may also try snoring
artificially to get the feel of the articulation for [ʀ], since snoring uses the same articulation
(except with an ingressive air stream and voicelessness). Once you have learned to produce
the voiced uvular trill [ʀ], simply eliminate the voicing to produce its voiceless counterpart
[ʀ̥]. You may also try saying [x] and then move the articulation farther back. Remember to
keep your articulators relaxed for these sounds. Listen to the uvular trills in the following
exercises and mimic each utterance.

238 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
In this lesson, you will learn to recognize two new vowel sounds and a new manner of
articulation. Both vowels introduced are in the central position and occur frequently in
English. The approximants introduced are also common English sounds.
Central Vowels
Although the central vowels in focus occur quite frequently in English, it is often
difficult for English speakers to identify them. Central vowels are articulated by the mid
section of the tongue modifying the air stream. In English, their use is usually limited to
unstressed syllables, where the vowel sound is naturally reduced to a central quality like [ɨ] or
[ə]. This phenomena is referred to as vowel reduction. Consider the word “enemy”
[ˈɛnəˌmi]. If this word is pronounced in a relaxed, natural manner, the vowel in the
unstressed syllable is reduced to [ə]. Only by over-articulating the word do we hear the
expected [ʌ] or [ɛ] in the second syllable. This same phenomenon can be observed in the word
“possess” [pʰəˈzɛs]. Here the first vowel is reduced from [o] to [ə]. The stressed syllable
maintains its [ɛ] quality. In these cases the speaker is usually unaware of the vowel reduction,
believing that he is actually producing a different vowel. Note that not all languages reduce
vowels in the same way, and some languages do not reduce vowels at all.
The bold symbols in the chart below represent the sounds introduced in this lesson.
The close central unrounded vowel [ɨ] is called Barred I. The mid central unrounded vowel is
called Schwa [ə].

Lesson 20: Central Vowels and Approximants 239
Illustration 20.1 pictures the approximate position of the tongue for all four of the
central vowels that we have studied so far. Note that this diagram shows only the different
positions of the tongue, while in reality the entire lower jaw would be repositioned for each
sound.
Illustration 20.2: [ɑ], [ʌ], [ə], and [ɨ]
Producing [ə]
The Schwa [ə] is a mid central unrounded vowel and by far the most common vowel in
spoken English. As we have already mentioned, the use of Schwa in English is usually
restricted to unstressed syllables, where it occurs due to vowel reduction. Exercise 20.1
demonstrates common English words pronounced with and without vowel reduction. The
first time the words are given they will be pronounced normally, with [ə] in the unstressed
syllable. The second time they will be over-articulated to eliminate vowel reduction. Listen
to the exercise once and then mimic.

The Schwa [ə] is produced with the tongue and other facial features in a relaxed,
central position. You can learn to recognize and reproduce the Schwa by prolonging and
isolating the reduced vowel in unstressed syllables. You may also try beginning with the
open back vowel [ɑ] and, while keeping your tongue stationary, slowly close your mouth,
resulting in [ɑ], [ʌ], and [ə]. Do not let your tongue slip back so that you get [ʊ], however. The
following exercise demonstrates [ɑ], [ʌ], [ə], and [ʊ]. Mimic each utterance after the recording.

Producing [ɨ]
The Barred I [ɨ] is a close central unrounded vowel and also occurs in unstressed
syllables in English. It usually occurs where close or near-close vowels are reduced to a
central quality, especially when followed by an alveolar consonant, such as in the word
“roses” [roᵘzɨz]. Not all English speakers reduce such vowels exactly the same way, however.
A Schwa [ə] may also be pronounced instead.
Because Schwa [ə] and Barred I [ɨ] are both used only in unstressed syllables and are
not believed to be the correct vowel, it can be difficult for English speakers to distinguish
242 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
between the two. When pronouncing [ɨ], the tongue is almost completely touching the roof of
the mouth. To practice saying and hearing these two vowels, try saying the phrase “Rosa’s
roses” [ˈroᵘ.zəˈroᵘ.zɨz].
The following exercise demonstrates some common English words with near-close
vowels reduced to [ɨ]. The first time the words are given they will contain [ɨ] in the unstressed
syllables. The second time they will contain the vowel that is considered the supposed proper
sound for the word. Listen to the exercise once, and then mimic. Repeat each word just as it
is transcribed, regardless of whether you normally pronounce it that way or not.

You can learn to control the pronunciation of Barred I [ɨ] by beginning with [ɑ] and
working your way up the chart through [ʌ], [ə], and finally [ɨ]. It is important to make sure
that your tongue remains relatively stationary during this sequence. Only the jaw should
move up and down. You may also try moving your tongue forward and backward between
[i] and [u] to find [ɨ] between the two. Practice the sequences in the following exercise. Mimic

Central Approximants
In Lesson 17, approximants were introduced. Central approximants1
are phones in
which the air stream is reduced, but not obstructed enough to cause audible turbulence. The
articulation of approximants, therefore, is not as open as that of vowels, but not as close as
that of fricatives and other consonants. Because this distinction is very slight, central
approximants are often wrongly classified as vowels or fricatives.
Lateral approximates have already been studied at length. Central approximants are
similar in many aspects; however, unlike lateral approximants, for which the air stream is
directed around the sides of the tongue, central approximants involve passage of the air
stream over the center of the tongue.
English Approximants
English speakers are already familiar with three approximants; however, they can be
difficult to distinguish from their vowel counterparts. The three English approximants are
listed in Table 20.1 below. The first symbol [ɹ] is the “r” sound in the word “red.” The [j]
represents what is normally considered a “y” in English, such as the word “yes.” The [w]
sounds like the English “w.”
1 Central approximants are commonly referred to simply as approximants.
Lesson 20: Central Vowels and Approximants 245
Table 20.1: English Approximants
Alveolar Palatal Labial-Velar2
Voiceless ɹ̥ ȷ̊ w̥
Voiced ɹ j w
As already mentioned, approximants involve greater constriction between the
articulator(s) and point(s) of articulation than vowels, but not as much constriction as
fricatives. One way to picture the articulation of approximants in relation to that of vowels
and fricatives is to extend the top of the vowel chart upward to include sounds produced
with a more closed position than the close vowels [i] and [u]. Illustration 20.2 pictures the
different manners of articulations produced as the tongue moves upward, closer to the palate.
Note that as the tongue raises, more of the tongue modifies the air stream, and therefore, the
point of articulation moves back slightly. As is customary with vowel charts, symbols on the
left side of the dot are unrounded, and symbols on the right are rounded. Also, as with all
charts, the position of the symbols is merely an approximation.
Illustration 20.3: Comparison of Consonant and Vowel Heights
Central approximants also differ from vowels in that they are non-syllabic. Instead of
constituting the nucleus of a syllable as vowels do, central approximants usually function as
peripheral elements of syllables. Because of this similarity to vowel glides, approximants are
often wrongly classified as such.3
2 Labial-velar approximants are double articulated phones. The air stream is modified at both the labial and
velar points of articulation.
3 The term “semi-vowel,” which is another name for vowel glides, is also often wrongly used to classify
approximants.

246 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
As stated previously in this book, English does not contain any on-glides. English
always uses approximants in such situations. Consider the word “ye” [ji]. When spoken
slowly, one can feel the tongue moving downward slightly from the palatal approximant to
the vowel. The symbol J [j] representing palatal approximants may be confusing to English
speakers, but many European languages pronounce the letter “j” as English speakers
pronounce “y.”
Another common approximant in English is the double articulated labial-velar
approximant W [w]. This sound is quite similar to the vowel [u], but the tongue and lips are
closer to the points of articulation. The word “woo” [wuː]4
demonstrates the difference
between the vowel [u] and the consonant [w]. When pronouncing this word, the one should
be able to feel the lips separate when transitioning from the approximant to the vowel. The
tongue also lowers slightly, but this is more difficult to notice. This distinction, though subtle,
is important because some languages use on-glides instead of approximants. An English
speaker imposing his or her own habits onto such a language would have an accent
noticeable to native speakers.
The alveolar approximant is represented by a Turned R [ɹ].5
The [ɹ] can be difficult for
speakers of other languages, and English speakers often confuse the alveolar approximant [ɹ]
with the rhotacized Schwa [ɚ] and rhotacized Turned Epsilon [ɝ]. It helps to remember that
approximants are non-syllabic, and, in English, usually precede vowels. To hear the
difference, slowly say the word “rear” [ɹi] repeatedly. The tongue is closer to the roof of the
mouth and less retroflexed when pronouncing the approximant. Also, native English
speakers naturally round and protrude their lips when pronouncing [r]. This habit must be
overcome to produce the pure sound.

Non-English Approximant
Many other approximants can be heard in the various languages of the world.
Unfamiliar approximant may be learned simply by lowering fricatives or raising vowels.
Table 20.2 below lists common approximants found in foreign languages.
4 An approximant may also be pronounced at the end of the word as well, i.e., [wuːw].
5 Though the Turned R [ɹ] may be alveolar, it is usually slightly retroflexed and, therefore, more alveopalatal.

Bilabial Labiodental Retroflexed Velar Labial-Palatal6
Voiceless β̞̊ ʋ̥ ɻ̊ ɰ̊ ɥ̊
Voiced β̞ ʋ ɻ ɰ ɥ
The bilabial approximant [β̞] does not have a separate symbol. The Beta [β] is used
with a Down Tack [ ̞] diacritic indicating lowering. Like all diacritics, Down Tacks may be
placed above or below a symbol. The bilabial approximant [β̞] is very similar to the [w] except
that the lips do not round and the tongue does not raise when pronouncing [ʋ].
The labiodental approximant is represented by a symbol called Cursive V [ʋ]. This
phone sounds similar to the voiced labiodental fricative [v].
The retroflexed approximant is symbolized the a Turned R with Right Tail [ɻ]. This is
the same as an alveolar approximant but with a Right Tail [ ̢ ] indicating retroflexion. This
phone sounds similar to the voiced retroflexed fricative [ʐ].
The symbol for the velar approximant is a Turned Long Leg M [ɰ]. To pronounce [ɰ]
the back of the tongue is raised more than a [u], but the tongue is not as close to the roof of the
mouth as it is when pronouncing a Gamma [ɣ]. This phone is similar to the [w]; however, the
lips remain unrounded when pronouncing [ɰ]. The [ɰ] is found in Irish dialects.
Another approximant is the double articulated, labial-palatal approximant, symbolized
by Turned H [ɥ]. This phone is articulated with the lips rounded and the mid section of the
tongue is raised near the roof of the mouth. The [ɥ] sounds similar to the rounded I [y], which
is studied in later lessons. The Turned H is common in French.
Voiceless Approximants
The concept of voiceless approximants is no different from that of other voiceless
sounds. The glottis must be controlled so that the vocal cords are inactive during the
approximant. Many English speakers produce voiceless approximants in their normal
speech. Consider the words “wear” and “where.” People who pronounce these words
differently pronounce a voiceless approximant [w̥] at the beginning of the word “where.”
Other speakers produce voiceless approximants in words like “cute” [kȷ̊ut] and “quick”
[kw̥ɪk].7
The following exercise contrasts voiceless approximants with voiced approximants in
6 Labial-palatal approximants are double articulated phones.
7 Note that when diacritics are applied above a symbol, any floating dots are removed, e.g., “j” [j] becomes
dotless “j” [ȷ].

you do not say a voiced and voiceless approximant together, such as [ȷ̊ju]. Mimic the voiceless

252 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Thus far you have studied stops produced only at the labial, dental, alveolar, and velar
points of articulation. As mentioned in Lesson 1, stops may be produced at any point along
the roof of the mouth. In this lesson you will learn some stops produced at the alveopalatal
point of articulation.
The two alveopalatal stops that will be studied are commonly called Retracted T [t ̠]
and Retracted D [d̠]. Alveopalatal stops are symbolized by placing a Minus Sign below [  ̠] or
above [  ̄] the symbol of the corresponding alveolar stop. The Minus Sign [  ̠] indicates that a
phone is retracted (or backed), usually meaning that the tongue is slightly farther back in the
mouth than usual.1
This diacritic can also be applied to other symbols besides stops.
A diacritic is used to indicate an alveopalatal stop instead of a unique symbol because
the distinction in sound between alveolar and alveopalatal stops is minor; however, some
languages do make a strong distinction between dentalized and alveopalatal stops.
These sounds are not found in English as distinct phones, but English speakers may
occasionally pronounce alveopalatal stops in place of alveolar stops in rapid speech. This is
especially common when a stop is followed by an alveopalatal phone. For example, the word
“church” may be rendered [t ̠ʃʰɚt ̠ʃ].
Table 21.1 gives the symbols for the stops introduced in this lesson along with similar
stops introduced previously.
Table 21.1: Introducing Alveopalatal Stops
Tip-Dental Tip-Alveolar Blade-Alveopalatal Tip-Retroflexed
Aspirated t̪ʰ tʰ t ̠ʰ ʈʰ
Voiceless t̪ t t ̠ ʈ
Voiced d̪ d d̠ ɖ
Illustration 21.1 below shows the position of the tongue for alveopalatal stops. The
blade is the articulator for these sounds, the tip of the tongue being down behind the lower
teeth. Notice that the articulation of these stops is identical to that of Enye [ñ], except that for
the stops the velic is closed.2
1 The Minus Sign [ ̠] diacritic must not be confused with the Bridge [ ̪], which indicates fronting or dentalizing.
2 Some linguists interpret the Enye [ñ] as alveopalatal, but others interpret it as palatal. Officially, the IPA
symbolizes an alveopalatal nasal as a Retracted N [n̠] and an Enye as a palatal nasal [ɲ].
Lesson 21: Alveopalatal Stops 253
Illustration 21.1: Voiced Alveopalatal Stop [d̠]
Producing Alveopalatal Stops
When producing alveopalatal stops, it is important to make sure that the tip of your
tongue stays tucked behind your lower teeth so that the blade can act as the articulator.
You are already familiar with the sounds [ʃ], [ʒ], [ñ], and [l̠], all of which are produced
at the alveopalatal point of articulation. You can use your familiarity with the articulation of
these sounds to help you learn the new alveopalatal sounds. Remember that alveopalatal
nasals and laterals are often accompanied by a palatal approximant [j] since the tongue is very
near the position for [j] during their release. You will find that the corresponding stops [t ̠] and
[d̠] are usually accompanied by an approximant as well. However, although the [j] quality is
usually present in alveopalatal consonants, it is not technically considered a part of the
consonant’s articulation. You must be careful not to confuse alveopalatal consonants with an
alveolar phone followed by an approximant, such as [djɑ].
To produce [d̠], begin by saying [ñ] and convert the sound from a nasal to a stop by
closing the velic. Practice this by saying the following sequence: [ɑñɑ ɑñɑ ɑñɑ ɑd̠ɑ ɑd̠ɑ
ɑd̠ɑ ɑñɑ ɑd̠ɑ ɑñɑ ɑd̠ɑ ɑñɑ ɑd̠ɑ]. You may also try the same procedure with [ʒ] and [d̠].
The primary difference between the articulation of [t ̠] and [d̠] is voicing. Practice
controlling your voicing by saying the sequence [ɑd̠ɑ ɑd̠ɑ ɑd̠ɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑd̠ɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑd̠ɑ
ɑt ̠ɑ ɑd̠ɑ ɑt ̠ɑ]. Practice aspirated and unaspirated alveopalatal stops by saying [ɑt ̠ɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑt ̠ɑ
ɑt ̠ʰɑ ɑt ̠ʰɑ ɑt ̠ʰɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑt ̠ʰɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑt ̠ʰɑ ɑt ̠ɑ ɑt ̠ʰɑ]. Try saying the words “cheap” and “jeep” with
the alveopalatal stops [t ̠] and [d̠] instead of with affricates.

Recognizing Alveopalatal Stops
Although producing alveopalatal stops may be relatively easy, many people find it
difficult to distinguish between alveopalatal and alveolar stops. The following exercise
contrasts these stops. Respond with “same” or “different.” When identifying alveopalatal
stops, remember that the alveopalatal sounds are often accompanied by an approximant.
Exercise 21.2: Differential: Same or Different
1. [ɑd̠ɑ ɑd̠ɑ] Same
2. [ɑd̠ɑ ɑdɑ] Different

260 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Thus far all of the vowels you have learned have been single vowels or vowels
separated by consonants or glides. In this lesson we will introduce sequences of adjacent
vowels called vowel clusters, as well adjacent vowel glides called glide clusters. These
phonetic features are relatively common throughout the languages of the world, and it is very
important that you be familiar with both their sound and articulation.
Vowel Clusters
A vowel cluster is two or more syllabic vowel sounds occurring together in a sequence
with no intervening consonants. Vowel clusters differ from vowels with glides in that vowel
glides are non-syllabic, while both sounds in a vowel cluster carry syllabicity. The sequence
[ɑi] consists of one syllable, but the corresponding vowel cluster [ɑ.i] is two separate syllables.
Vowel clusters are very common in languages like Tahitian and many indigenous
languages of North America. English speakers do not naturally say vowel clusters. English
speakers always insert either an approximant or glottal stop between two vowels. For
example, “poet” [ˈpoᵘ.wɨt], “eon” [ˈi.jɑn], and “uh-oh” [ˈʌʔoᵘ] all contain consonants separating
the vowels and are therefore not vowel clusters.
Representing Vowel Clusters
Vowel clusters should be represented by writing the symbols for both vowels with a
syllable division separating the two, such as [ɑ.i]. The syllable break is important because it is
common for linguists not to distinguish vowel glides from syllabic vowels, and, therefore, it
two vowels side-by-side would be ambiguous. Table 22.1 gives examples of vowel glides and
corresponding vowel clusters. This table is by no means exhaustive, as any combination of
vowels can be articulated in any sequence to form a vowel cluster.

It can be sometimes difficult to tell whether a sequence is composed of two separate
vowels or one long vowel. In terms of duration, vowel clusters and lengthened vowels may
262 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
occupy roughly the same amount of time. However, it is important to remember that vowel
clusters differ from lengthened vowels in that a lengthened vowel represents a single
prolonged syllable, while each vowel in a cluster represents a separate syllable. It is entirely
possible for two vowels that are exactly the same to occur together with separate syllable
beats, making the sequence a cluster rather than a lengthened vowel. A cluster consisting of
two identical vowels is often called a re-articulated vowel. In such cases, the quality of the
vowel may remain the same throughout the entire sequence, but the presence of two syllable
beats, and very often a change of stress within the cluster, constitutes the re-articulation.
The following exercise contains utterances consisting of multiple syllables. Focus on
the vowels in the second syllable of each word and respond with “lengthened” or
“re-articulated.”
Exercise 22.3: Recognizing Lengthened and Re-articulated Vowels
1. [moˈpʰɑ.ɑ] Re-articulated
2. [moˈpʰɑː] Lengthened

12. [juˈkʰæː] Lengthened
13. [diˈse.e] Re-articulated
14. [diˈse.e] Re-articulated
15. [diˈseː] Lengthened
As we have already stated, any combination of vowel sounds may be articulated
sequentially to form a vowel cluster. In some languages, vowel clusters have been known to
consist of more than two vowels. The following exercise contains vowel sequences of one,
two, and three syllables. Remember that vowel glides are non-syllabic. Do not confuse two
vowels and a glide for a three-syllable vowel cluster. Listen to the glided vowels and vowel
clusters in the following exercise and tell how many syllables you hear. Respond with “one,”
“two,” or “three.”

15. [u.oᵘ] two
Lesson 22: Vowel and Glide Clusters 263
Producing Vowel Clusters
When producing vowel clusters,you must make sure that no unwanted transitional
sounds are inserted between the vowels. As stated earlier, English speakers break up the
cluster with an approximant, as in the sequence [uwo]. Another common error is to place a
glottal stop between the vowels, such as [uʔo]. These habits prevent many speakers from
pronouncing clusters correctly, since by definition a vowel cluster has no intermediate
consonants separating the vowels. It is important that you learn to eliminate the transitional
sounds and still pronounce each vowel with its own syllable beat.
The following exercise builds pronunciation from vowels separated by glides and
glottal stops to pure vowel clusters. Follow along in the text and mimic each utterance.

10. [i.ɛ.e] Neither
11. [ʊʔuʔo] Stop
12. [æ.u.ə] Neither
Just as each vowel in a cluster carries its own beat, it may also have its own level of
stress. The primary stress can occur on the first syllable, the second syllable, or on both
syllables equally. The placement of stress often affects the sound of vowel clusters, causing
them to be confused with glides. Watch the stress patterns on the vowel clusters in the
following exercise and mimic each utterance.

15. [lɔ.æ.aˈɑ.o.ei]
Glide Clusters
Just as it is possible for two vowels to occur together with no intervening sounds, it is
also possible for two vowel glides to occur together with no sounds between. This means that
more than one glide can precede or follow the syllabic sound of a syllable. A series of
adjacent glides occurring in the same syllable is called a glide cluster.
While both sounds in a vowel cluster are syllabic, both sounds in a glide cluster are
non-syllabic. A glide cluster, therefore, can be described more accurately as a sequence of
adjacent, non-syllabic vowel sounds preceding or following a syllabic sound. Glide clusters
do not occur normally in English.
Glide clusters are represented by writing the symbols for both glide sounds in order,
such as [ᵘⁱɑ]. Sometimes the sounds in a glide cluster occur in rapid sequence and sometimes
simultaneously, making it difficult to tell which is the initial sound. Represent simultaneous
clusters by first writing the sound that occurs more toward the front of the oral cavity.
Because glide clusters do not occur in English, they can be difficult to learn. However,
pronouncing glide clusters is essentially the same as saying multiple vowels quickly. The
Lesson 22: Vowel and Glide Clusters 265
following exercise demonstrates single glides, glide clusters, and glides in two separate
syllables. Follow along in the text and mimic each utterance.

268 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
You have already studied many sounds produced at the velar point of articulation. In
this lesson you will focus on sounds produced slightly before and slightly behind the velum.
You will recall from Lesson 1 that the area immediately in front of the velum is called the
hard palate. This is the palatal point of articulation. The area immediately behind the velum
is called the uvular point of articulation. The articulator for palatal sounds is usually the mid
part of the tongue, while for velar and uvular sounds, the back of the tongue is the articulator.
Palatal and Uvular Consonants
Palatal and uvular consonants can be referred to as fronted and retracted (or backed)
velar sounds. You must be careful, however, not to confuse back-velar sounds, in which the
back of the tongue touches the velar point of articulation, with backed velar sounds, where
the back of the tongue touches the uvular point of articulation.
The consonant chart below introduces the symbols for palatal and uvular sounds. This
chart is by no means exhaustive, since voiceless counterparts of the palatal and uvular nasals
and laterals presented are also possible. The palatal and uvular fricatives and stops can also
be combined to create affricates.

Several new symbols are introduced in Table 23.1 above. Voiceless palatal stops are
symbolized by a Lowercase C [c], and uvular stops are symbolized by a Lowercase Q [q].
Even though these symbols are from the English alphabet, they do not sound anything like
the English letters. Voiced palatal and uvular stops are symbolized by Dotless Barred J [ɟ]
and Small Capital G [ɢ] respectively.
Voiceless palatal fricatives are symbolized by a symbol called C Cedilla [ç]. Voiceless
uvular fricatives are symbolized by the Greek letter Chi [χ]. Voiced palatal fricatives are
Lesson 23: Palatal and Uvular Consonants 269
represented by a symbol called Curly Tail J [ʝ], and voiced uvular fricatives are represented
by an Inverted Small Capital R [ʁ].
The following facial diagrams illustrate the position of the tongue for the articulation
of palatal, velar, and uvular stops. Study the diagrams to familiarize yourself with the new
points of articulation. For the corresponding fricatives, the articulation is the same except for
a small gap between the articulator and point of articulation. Palatal and uvular nasals are
produced with the same tongue position, but the velic must be open.

Producing Palatal and Uvular Consonants
Palatal and uvular phones are rare in English. Velar consonants followed by front
vowels may be produced more toward the front of the velum, nearer to the palatal point of
articulation, but this movement must be exaggerated in order to reach the hard palate. Velar
consonants adjacent to back vowels my be closer to the uvular point of articulation in
anticipation of the proceeding vowel, but again, this movement must be exaggerated in order
to reach the uvula. You can feel this difference in back-velar stops by saying the words in the
following chart.
270 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Table 23.2: Comparison of Palatal, Velar, and Uvular Stops
Palatal Velar Uvular
“key” [cʰi] “cop” [kʰɑp] “caw” [qʰɔ]
“creep” [cʰɹip] “crop” [kʰɹɑp] “craw” [qɹɔ]
“geek” [ɟik] “guck” [gʌk] “gawk” [ɢɔk]
The voiceless palatal fricative [ç] occurs in English words when an “h” precedes a
palatal approximant [j] or the close front vowel [i], such as in the words “hue” [çju] and “he”
[çi]. To become familiar with the palatal fricative, try prolonging the word “hue” and
concentrate on the height and position of the tongue.
Another way to gain a feel for the articulation of palatal and uvular sounds is by
beginning with [x] and moving your tongue forward and backward so that you “hiss” the
sequences [x ç x χ x ç x χ x]. You should hear the pitch move up and down during this
sequence. This change of pitch is due to the altered size of the oral cavity. As the tongue
moves forward, the size of the oral cavity is reduced, creating a higher resonance. When the
tongue moves back, the oral cavity is enlarged, creating a lower sound. This difference in
pitch can be very helpful in differentiating between palatal and uvular sounds.
Beginning with [x], try hissing the song “London Bridge is Falling Down” as if you
were whistling the tune with the back of your tongue. The last three syllables, “fair la-dy,”
consist of the palatal fricative [ç], the velar fricative [x], and the uvular fricative [χ],
respectively. This same procedure can be done with voicing to learn the articulation of [ʝ], [ɣ],
and [ʁ].
You may also try imitating a donkey’s “hee-haw,” replacing [h] with [x]. Push the
articulation of the last syllable back as far as possible. This will produce both [ç] and [χ]. Try
the same procedure using voicing.
Once you have learned to control the use of the palatal and uvular points of
articulation with stops and fricatives, you will have no trouble with the production of palatal
and uvular nasals, laterals, and approximants. Mimic the consonants in the following
exercise. Make sure, however, that you do not pronounce the palatal sounds with the same
articulation as alveopalatal consonants.

Recognizing Palatal and Uvular Consonants
Using palatal and uvular consonants in the place of velar consonants makes no
difference in the meaning of English words. In some languages, however, these sounds can
be contrastive. In such languages it is very important to be able to distinguish between
palatal, velar, and uvular consonants. The following exercises will help you to develop an ear
for these sounds.

Palatal and Uvular Affricates
As you have already learned, palatal or uvular stops and fricatives can be combined to
create affricates. The most common combinations are homorganic, where both the stop and
fricative share the same point of articulation. It is also possible, however, to produce
heterorganic affricates by combining palatal or uvular stops with fricatives of any other point
of articulation.
Palatal and uvular affricates should not be particularly difficult to produce, but
differentiating between palatal, velar, and uvular affricates can be a challenge. The following
exercise contains homorganic palatal, velar, and uvular affricates. Listen to each utterance
and respond by naming the point of articulation.

Palatal, Velar, and Uvular Nasals and Laterals
In addition to stops and fricatives, nasals and laterals can also be formed at the palatal
and uvular points of articulation. These phones are made in exactly the same way as their
alveolar counterparts, except that the tongue is positioned farther back in the mouth. This
will feel quite awkward to an English speaker at first, and he will naturally try to move the
tongue toward the alveolar ridge, but such habits must be overcome in order to correctly
pronounce these sounds. Table 23.2 above lists the symbols used to represent these sounds.

ʎ ʟ
Palatal nasals are represented by a symbol called Left-tail N (at left) [ɲ]. It may help to
remember this symbol as the combination of a “j” and an “n.” The uvular nasals are
symbolized by a Small Capital N [ɴ]. To learn how to pronounce these phones, try
pronouncing a lengthened Eng [ŋː] and move the tongue forward and backward.
The palatal lateral approximant is symbolized by a Turned Y [ʎ]. This sound is quite
difficult for English speakers to hear and pronounce. When pronouncing this sound, one
must ensure that the air steam flows laterally around the sides of the tongue.
The velar lateral approximant is represented by a Small Capital L [ʟ]. This too is
awkward to pronounce at first. To produce this sound, start by pronouncing a lengthened
Eng [ŋː] and then redirect the air stream from going through the velic to moving around the
sides of the tongue. Though the sides of the tongue may move slightly, be careful not to move
the tongue forward.
After practicing forming these new sounds, listen to and mimic the exercise below.

280 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
All of the vowels that we have studied so far have been produced with the velic closed,
the resonance occurring strictly in the oral cavity. In this lesson we will introduce vowels
produced with the velic partially open, allowing the sound to resonate in both the oral and
nasal cavities at the same time. Sounds which involve both oral and nasal resonation are said
to be nasalized, while those involving strictly oral resonation are said to be non-nasalized, or
oral sounds.
Nasalization
The distinction between nasal sounds and nasalized sounds is very important. Nasals
are sounds in which the air stream is completely blocked at some point in the oral cavity and
redirected through the nasal cavity. For nasals no air escapes through the mouth because it is
completely blocked by an articulator. For nasalized sounds, on the other hand, the air stream
is not blocked in the oral cavity. The oral cavity remains the primary channel of articulation.
The velic is lowered, however, allowing the nasal cavity to act as a secondary channel of
articulation. This means that the air stream, instead of exiting the mouth only, exits through
the nose as well. Illustration 24.1 and Illustration 24.2 picture the difference between nasal
and nasalized articulation.
Illustration 24.1: Nasal Consonant Illustration 24.2: Nasalized Vowel
Understanding Nasalization
Vowels are the most commonly nasalized sounds and will therefore occupy the main
focus of this lesson. However, most continuants (sounds other than stops) can be nasalized.
For voiceless consonants like [f] and [s], the acoustic quality added by nasalization is slight.
For voiced consonants like [v] and [z], on the other hand, nasalization may change the sound
Lesson 24: Nasalized Vowels 281
significantly. Nasalized consonants are not drilled in this lesson, but you should be aware
that they do occur.
It is important to note that nasalized sounds are articulated primarily in the oral cavity.
While different vowel qualities can be produced by altering the size and shape of the oral
cavity, the size and shape of the nasal cavity are essentially fixed. A speaker can control
whether or not a vowel is nasalized, but cannot produce different vowel sounds by changing
the size or shape of the nasal cavity itself. Therefore, nasalization is viewed as a modification
of vowels, rather than unique vowel sounds.
Degrees of Nasalization
There may be different degrees of nasalization depending on the size of the velic
opening. Sounds produced with the velic only slightly open are referred to as lightly
nasalized, while those produced with a large velic opening are referred to as heavily
nasalized. The following facial diagrams illustrate the position of the velum for different
degrees of nasalization.
Illustration 24.3:
Non-Nasalized
Illustration 24.4:
Lightly Nasalized
Illustration 24.5:
Heavily Nasalized
Nasalization is represented by placing a Tilde Above [ ̃] a symbol (for example, [ɑ̃]) or
a Tilde Below [  ̰] a symbol that has an ascender (for example, [ʎ̰]). If three different degrees
of nasalization are present in a language, an ogonek [ ̢ ] (or Polish hook), can be used in
conjunction with the tilde to represent heavy nasalization (for example, []).
Nasalized Vowels
Nasalized vowels are found contrastively in some languages. This means that the
meaning of a word can change depending on whether a vowel is oral or nasalized. Although
282 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
nasalized vowels occur quite frequently in English, they make no difference in the meaning of
words. Most English speakers nasalize vowels that occur next to nasal consonants like [m]
and [n]. In these cases, the velic simply opens in anticipation of the nasal consonant. This
happens automatically with no conscious thought from the speaker.
To determine if a vowel is nasalized, hold your nose closed with your thumb and
finger as you pronounce the vowel. If the vowels are purely oral, their sound will not be
affected by the closure. If they are nasalized, you will feel the pressure and vibration of the
air stream in the nasal cavity. Prolong the vowel sound if you are still unsure if it is nasalized.
Say the pairs of words in the following chart and try to detect the difference between
the vowels in the first column and those in the second column.
Table 24.1: Comparison of Oral and Nasal Vowels
Oral Nasal
“beat” [bit] “mean” [min]
“bit” [bɪt] “min” [mɪ̃n]
“bet” [bɛt] “men” [mɛ̃n]
“bat” [bæt] “man” [mæ
̃ n]
“pot” [pʰɑt] “mom” [mɑ̃m]
"boot" [but] “moon” [mun]
Producing Nasalization
Although most English speakers produce both nasalized and oral vowels in their
normal speech, it is necessary to practice in order to be able to control their production in any
environment. You can practice gaining control of the velic by saying sequences of stops and
nasals since the only physical difference between homorganic stops and nasals is the position
of the glottis. Say the word “hidden” without putting a vowel between the [d] and [n] of the
last syllable, such as [hɪd.n ]. Repeat the last syllable several times so that you get the sequence
[dn dn dn dn dn ]. You should be able to feel the velic opening and closing during this sequence.
Try the same procedure with the sequences [bm bm bm bm bm ] and [gŋ̍gŋ̍gŋ̍gŋ̍gŋ̍].
Say the sequence [mimimimimi], making sure that the velic does not close between the
consonants. Prolong the last vowel and then, while making sure that the velic does not close,
isolate the vowel [i]. Test the vowel to see if it is nasalized by holding your nose closed with
Lesson 24: Nasalized Vowels 283
your fingers. Try the same procedure with other vowels such as [ɑ] and [u], and other nasals
like [n] and [ŋ].
Most people find it relatively easy to produce nasalized vowels next to nasal
consonants. Producing them next to oral sounds, however, is much more difficult. You can
practice this by isolating the nasalized vowel with the procedure described above, and
inserting an oral sound before it.
Practice mimicking the sequences in the following exercise. You must concentrate on
opening your velic after the oral consonant.

Recognizing Nasalized Vowels
It can often be more difficult to identify nasalized vowels than non-nasalized vowels
because their quality is altered slightly by the resonation in the nasal cavity. Nasalized
vowels are often perceived as being produced at a lower position than they actually are. The
following exercise demonstrates the oral and nasalized counterparts of each vowel that has
been introduced, beginning with [i] and going around the chart. First listen to the different
quality added by nasalization, and then try mimicking each vowel.

288 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
As we have seen in previous lessons, the articulation of consonants involves some
degree of closure between an articulator and a point of articulation. It is possible for two such
closures to occur at the same time. A sound consisting of two simultaneous closures of the
same manner of articulation and the same voicing are called double articulations. Both
sounds involved in double articulation are usually of equal or nearly equal prominence. The
most common double articulated consonants are stops, although double nasals also occur in
some languages. Double fricatives and even double affricates are possible, but rare.
Double Articulations
Double articulations are most often composed of labial and velar closures. These are
described as labio-velar articulations. Labio-alveolar articulations and labio-alveopalatal
articulations do occur in some languages, but are much less common. Just as affricates,
double articulations can be symbolized by placing a Tie Bar Above [  ͡ ] (or Double Breve) or a
Tie Bar Below [ ͜ ] the symbols of both consonants involved, such as [k͡p] or [g͜b]. The
following chart gives the symbols for the sounds introduced in this lesson.
Table 25.1: Introducing Double Articulations

Stops
Voiceless t ͡p k͡p
Voiced d͡b g͜b
Nasals Voiced n͡m ŋ͡m
For double articulations, the closure produced farther back is represented first. This is
because the sound produced closest to the origin of the air stream is usually heard first,
especially in sequences where the double articulation occurs word medial.
The consonants involved in a double articulation occur simultaneously rather than
sequentially as in other types of consonant clusters. Even consonant clusters with close
transition are sequential; though the sounds may overlap slightly, neither the initiations nor
releases of the two articulations occur at the same time. In double articulations, on the other
hand, either the initiations or the releases (or both in some cases) occur at the same time.
They are articulated together as a unit rather than as separate sounds. Functioning as a unit,
the double articulation takes roughly the normal time slot of one consonant, whereas a
sequential consonant cluster takes as many slots as consonants in the cluster.

The following facial diagrams illustrate individually articulated labial and velar
consonants in contrast with double articulated labial and velar consonants.
Illustration 25.1: [p] Illustration 25.2: [k] Illustration 25.3: [k͡p]
Producing Double Articulation
In order to produce double articulated consonants, you must learn to form and release
two consonant closures at the same time. Begin by saying the following sequences faster and
faster until the sounds are run together. This will eliminate the vowel between the [g] and [b],
and result in double articulation. You will probably find the labio-velar articulations easiest,
so practice them until you can articulate them easily before moving on to the labio-alveolar
articulations. Mimic each utterance after the recording.

Sometimes people produce double stops when trying to imitate a chicken clucking.
Say the following sequence of double stops after the recording, making it sound as if you

were imitating a chicken. When you can produce [k͡p] easily, substitute other double
articulations.

8. [g͜bəg g͜bəg g͜bəg g͜bəg g͜bəg g͜bəg g͜bəg g͜bəg]
Another way to learn to produce double articulations is to say the following sequences
of English words and change the syllable boundaries, making the last consonant of the first
syllable part of the second syllable. Repeat each utterance after the recording.

Recognizing Double Articulations
When listening for double articulations in word medial and word final positions, keep
in mind that the articulation closest to the back of the oral cavity is usually heard first and can
obscure the sound of the labial articulation. This is because the air stream coming from the
lungs is acted upon first by the articulation closest to its origin. It will help immensely if you
are able to watch the speaker’s mouth and see the labial articulation. The articulation closest
to the front of the oral cavity may sound predominant in word initial double articulations.

The acoustic difference between double articulations and single articulations is often
very slight. It may require much practice to be able to recognize them well. The following

Double Articulations with Modified Release
When double stops are released, they are often accompanied by a slight pop or click
caused by a movement of the tongue during the release. Study Illustration 25.1 and
Illustration 25.1. The dotted lines represent the position the tongue moves to as the sound is
released. Notice that in Illustration 25.1 the tongue moves forward during the release,
pressurizing the air between the velar and labial points of articulation. When this pressure is
released, it can sound like a small burst or pop.
In Illustration 25.2 the tongue moves backward during the release, creating a vacuum
between the labial and velar articulations. This can cause it to sound similar to an implosive
articulation at its release.
Although the acoustic difference added by these tongue movements may be slight, you
should be aware of their affect on double articulations and be able to produce either type of
release.

Prenasalization
In some languages, stops and affricates are often preceded by a brief nasal onset called
prenasalization. In a prenasalized sound, the velic opens a brief moment before the stop is
released. Prenasalization differs from a consonant cluster involving a nasal followed by a
stop in that the nasal onset for prenasalization is much less prominent than an ordinary
consonant. The nasalization and the stop function together as a unit, much like double
articulations, with both sounds occurring in the same syllable.
Unlike double articulations, prenasalized consonants tend to share the same point of
articulation, but differ in their manner of articulation and sometimes in voicing. The nasal
sound is usually voiced, whereas the stop may be either voiced or voiceless. Also, the nasal
sound is not as prominent as the following stop or affricate, whereas both sounds in a double
articulation carry the same degree of prominence.
Prenasalized sounds are symbolized by a superscript nasal symbol placed before the
symbol of the stop or affricate involved, such as [ᵐb], [ⁿdʒ], or [ᵑg].
Mimic the prenasalized consonants in the following exercise. Be careful not to produce
syllabic nasals such as [m .bɑ] or [n .dɑ].

298 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
As was explained in Lesson 10, it is possible for any vowel to be produced with either
rounded or unrounded lips. In English, front and central vowels are unrounded, while the
majority of back vowels are rounded. In other languages, rounded and unrounded vowels
can conform to different patterns. In languages like French and German, for example, front
rounded vowels occur quite frequently. Vietnamese and Turkish, on the other hand, contain
many back unrounded vowels. In this lesson you will learn to control lip rounding on front
and back vowels.
The following vowel chart presents several front rounded vowels and back unrounded
vowels in addition to the vowels that you have already studied. These symbols augment the
inventory of English vowels in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Many more vowels
remain, but due to time constraints, no further vowels will be studied in detail in this
textbook.
Illustration 26.1: Non-English Front and Back Vowels
Front Rounded Vowels
When producing front rounded vowels, remember that the position of the tongue for
each front rounded vowel is the same as that of its unrounded counterpart. Only the
condition of the lips changes. The configuration of the lips for each front rounded vowel is
the same as the back rounded vowel of the same height. For example, to produce the front
rounded vowel [y], the tongue is in the same position as for [i], while the lips are rounded as
for the close back vowel [u].

Lesson 26: Front Rounded and Back Unrounded Vowels
299
As with all other vowels, you must be careful not to glide front rounded vowels.
Producing [y]
The close, front rounded vowel is symbolized by a Lowercase Y [y]; however, this
sound has little in common with the English “y.”1
A good way to achieve the articulation of
[y] is to begin with [u] and move your tongue forward to the [i] position while keeping your
lips rounded. Move your tongue slowly back and forth between these positions several
times. This technique is called slurring. Practice slurring between [u] and [i] until you can
easily keep your lips rounded to produce [y]. Practice isolating [y] in the following drill.
1. [uːyː y y y]
You may also try slurring with the lips instead of the tongue. Keep your tongue from
moving while you begin with [i] and practice rounding and unrounding your lips. Then
isolate [y].
2. [iːyː y y y]
Practice saying the phrase, “He sees three mean bees,” with tightly rounded lips.
3. [ˈçyˈsyzˈθɹyˈmynˈbyz]
Often the best way to learn the articulation of a new sound is by mimicry. Listen
carefully to the vowels in the following exercise and repeat the sentences after the recording.
Follow the transcription.
Exercise 26.1: Producing [i], [u] and [y]
1. [i] “Fleece the geese.”
2. [u] “Fluce the goose.”
3. [y] “Flyce the gyse.”
Producing [ø]
The rounded counter part to [e] is called the Slashed O [ø].2
The [ø] is a close-mid
front rounded vowel. To learn the articulation of this vowel, practice the same slurring
1 Do not confuse the Lowercase Y [y] with the Small Capital Y [ʏ]. The [ʏ] is a near-close near-front rounded
vowel. Also, the English “y” consonant sound is represented by the approximant Lowercase J [j].
2 Do not confuse the Slashed O [ø] with the Barred O [ɵ]. The [ɵ] is a close-mid central rounded vowel.
300 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
procedure as with the previous vowel. Slur between the vowels [o] and [e], keeping your lips
rounded. Repeat the slur several times, and then isolate the front rounded vowel.
1. [oːøː ø ø ø]
Now practice the rounded and unrounded slur between [e] and [ø]. Remember to
keep your tongue from moving during this exercise.
2. [eːøː ø ø ø]
Say the phrase, “Kate bakes eight cakes,” with rounded lips on each vowel. The lip
rounding for [ø] will be slightly less than for [y].
3. [ˈkʰøtˈbøksˈʔøtˈkʰøks]
Mimic the sentences in the following exercise. Practice careful lip rounding as you
repeat each utterance.
Exercise 26.2: Producing [e], [o], and [ø]
1. [e] “Make the cake.”
2. [o] “Moke the coke.”
3. [ø] “Møke the cøke.”
Producing [œ]
The open-mid front rounded vowel is symbolized by a Lowercase O-E Ligature [œ].3
It is the rounded counterpart to Epsilon [ɛ]. This vowel is lower and produced with slightly
less lip rounding than [ø]. Practice the same slurring procedure as used above, this time
slurring between [ɔ], [ɛ], and [œ].
Begin with [ɔ], and keep your lips rounded as you glide toward [œ]. Isolate the
rounded vowel, and repeat it several times.
1. [ɔːœː œ œ œ]
Slur between the front rounded and unrounded positions.
2. [ɛːœː œ œ œ]
Say the phrase, “Shred Ted’s red sled,” with slightly rounded lips.
3. [ˈʃɹœdˈtœdzˈɹœdˈslœd]
3 Do not confuse the Lowercase O-E Ligature [œ] with the Small Capital O-E Ligature [ɶ]. The [ɶ] is an open
front rounded vowel.

Recognizing Front Rounded Vowels
The shape of the lips affects the sound of vowels to a great degree. English speakers
often find it difficult to identify vowels which do not conform to the English lip rounding
patterns. Since front rounded vowels do not occur in English, you may have to practice a
good deal to be able to identify their positions. Listen to the vowels in the following exercise
and respond with “same” or “different.”

Back Unrounded Vowels
English speakers produce most back vowels with rounded lips. Many languages,
however, have primarily unrounded back vowels. Do not let your English habits keep you
from pronouncing these vowels correctly. Remember that back unrounded vowels should be
produced with lip rounding similar to the corresponding front vowel of the same height.
Producing [ɯ]
The close back unrounded vowel is represented by a Turned M [ɯ]. This vowel is
produced with the tongue in the same position as for [u] but with unrounded lips.
To learn to produce Turned M [ɯ], practice slurring between the front unrounded
vowel [i] and the back unrounded vowel [ɯ]. Make sure that your lips remain unrounded as
your tongue moves to the back position. Practice this sequence several times, and then
practice the back unrounded vowel in isolation.
1. [iːɯː ɯ ɯ ɯ]
Slur between the back rounded [u] and the back unrounded [ɯ]. Make sure that your
tongue does not move during this sequence. Then isolate the unrounded vowel.
2. [uːɯː ɯ ɯ ɯ]
Say the sentence, “Two shooters shoot through a goose,” with unrounded lips. You
may find it helpful to smile as you say the words. This keeps the lips from becoming
rounded.
3. [ˈtʰɯˈʃɯ.tɝz ˈʃɯtˈθɹɯʔəˈgɯs]
Mimic the phrases in the following exercise. Watch your lips with a mirror to make
sure that they are unrounded.

Exercise 26.8: Producing [i], [u], and [ɯ]
1. [i] “Fleece the geese.”
2. [u] “Fluce the goose.”
3. [ɯ] “Flɯce the gɯse.”
Producing [ɤ]
The close-mid back unrounded vowel is represented by a symbol called Ram’s Horns
[ɤ]. This is the rounded counterpart to [o], and is produced with the tongue in the same
position as for [o]. To learn to produce this sound, practice slurring between front unrounded
vowel [e] and the corresponding back unrounded position [ɤ]. Repeat this procedure several
times.
1. [eːɤː ɤ ɤ ɤ]
Now slur between [o] and [ɤ]. Be careful to keep your tongue from moving.
2. [oːɤː ɤ ɤ ɤ]
Say the phrase, “Joe go blow snow,” with unrounded lips. Remember to smile as you
say the words.

310 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Consonants are defined not only by their articulators but also in the way that their
articulators are released and in the types of transitions that link them to other consonants.
There are several different ways in which the articulators can separate after pronouncing a
consonant. This separation is referred to as their release. The different ways in which the
articulators move from one consonant to the next are called transitions. To avoid a distracting
accent, it is very important to be able to recognize these features and be able to reproduce
them accurately.
The Release of Consonants
The release of consonants describes the interaction between the articulator and point
of articulation immediately following the closure of a consonant. Consonants which occur at
the ends of utterances can be either released or unreleased. In other words, the articulator
may move away from the point of articulation (released), or it may remain stationary
(unreleased).
Released Consonants
There are several different ways in which consonants, and stops in particular, may be
released. If a stop is voiceless, it may be followed by aspiration and described as an aspirated
release, or it may be released audibly without significant air flow and described simply as a
regular release.
Voiced consonants may be released in several ways. Like voiceless stops, they can be
followed by a regular release or aspiration. Voiced aspiration is transcribed by adding a
Superscript Hooktop H [ʱ] after the consonant, such as [ɑbʱ].1
A voiced consonant may also
be released as the vocal chords are still vibrating and, therefore, generate a short vowel
sound, often identified as a Schwa [ə]. This type of release is known as voiced release and is
represented by a Superscript Schwa [ᵊ] following the consonant, such as [ɑbᵊ].
The difference between a voiced aspirated release and voiced release is that the vocal
chords are slightly farther apart when producing voiced aspiration than they are when
producing a voiced release. Also, a larger amount of air generally escapes when aspiration
occurs.
Consonants can also be released into a nasal or lateral. This is transcribed simply by
placing after the consonant a superscript symbol, such as Superscript N [ⁿ], Superscript M [ᵐ],
or Superscript L [ˡ]. For example, the English word “cotton” could be pronounced as [ˈkʰɑ.tⁿn ]
and “bottle” could be transcribed as [ˈbɑ.tˡl ]. These English examples end with a syllabic
1 Voiced aspiration is usually referred to as breathy voice or murmur and will be studied at length in a later
lesson.
Lesson 27: Transition and Release 311
consonant, but not all languages have a full nasal or lateral after a release. Often, nasal and
lateral releases are voiced, but they can also be voiceless. To indicate voiceless nasal or later
release, simply add an Under- or Over-ring diacritic to the superscript symbol (for example,
[]).
Unreleased Consonants
If at the end of an utterance, the articulator and point of articulation either maintain
contact or separate inaudibly, the final sound is said to be unreleased. An unreleased sound
is represented by placing a superscript diacritic called Corner [ ̚ ] after the consonant, as in
[ɑp̚].2
Table 27.1 below lists the different types of releases and their symbolization.

Stops are not the only sounds which may be unreleased. Nasals and laterals are also
commonly unreleased in English. In French, on the other hand, most utterance-final nasals
and laterals are spoken with a voiced release. The following exercise demonstrates English
words with different types of release. Follow the transcription and mimic each word.

Transition
A consonant cluster is made up of two or more consonants that occur adjacently with
no intervening vowels. When studying consonant clusters, you must understand how the
articulators transition from the first consonant to the second. The act of changing from the
articulation of one consonant to another is called transition.
Close Transition
There are several different types of transition that can take place between consonants.
In affricates the first consonant is released directly into the second with no intervening
sounds. A consonant cluster formed with no audible space between the consonants is said to
have close transition. The second sound is formed before the first one is released.
Consider the word “cupcake,” [kʰʌpkʰeⁱk]. Notice that if the words are pronounced in a
normal, relaxed manner there is no space between the [p] and the [k]. The articulation for [k]
is formed while the [p] is still unreleased. As soon as [p] is released, the [k] is heard. This type
of transition parallels the unreleased consonants introduced earlier in this chapter, except that
it occurs between contiguous consonants rather than utterance-final.
314 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Close transition is left unmarked in phonetic transcription. In a consonant cluster, if
open transition is not specifically indicated, the transition is assumed to be close.
Open transition
Open transition occurs when a transient sound such as aspiration of a short vowel
occurs between the two consonants of a consonant cluster. There is a brief period of time
between the release of the first consonant and the onset of the second. In voiceless stops, this
transitional sound is heard as aspiration. This type of transition occurs in English when
syllables such as “cup” and “cake” are over-articulated, resulting in an aspirated [pʰ] at the
end of “cup.” A phonetic transcription would look like [kʰʌpʰkʰeⁱk].
Clusters of voiced consonants often have an open transition consisting of a short,
central vowel such as schwa. This type of transition typifies the accent of Italians speaking
English as a second language. Consider the words “big boy.” An English speaker would
normally pronounce these words with close transition between [g] and [b]. An Italian person,
on the other hand, may insert a short vowel between these consonants, forming a voiced
transition such as [bɪɡᵊboⁱ]. Many oriental speakers who have difficulty pronouncing English
consonant clusters insert a short Schwa between the consonants as in the word “stop,”
resulting in [sᵊtɑp]. Voiced consonants can also transition with aspiration, but this is quite
rare.
Table 27.2 compares the different types of transition for voiced and voiceless
consonants.

318 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
The concept of voicing was introduced in Lesson 2. Remember that voicing originates
in the glottis and is created by the vibration of the vocal cords as the air stream passes
through the larynx. Whether or not the vocal cords vibrate depends on the position of the
vocal cords and the amount of tension applied to the them. These conditions are described as
states of the glottis.
States of the Glottis
Different degrees of voicing are possible depending on the state of the glottis. If the
glottis is completely relaxed, the vocal cords will be spread apart, allowing air to pass
between them with no vibration or resonance. This state is known as voiceless. As the vocal
cords are tensed and drawn together, the vibration increases until modal voice is reached.
This state, known as voiced, is that of optimal tension for smooth vibration. If the tension
continues to increase, the vibrations decrease until the vocal cords are so tense that the air
stream is blocked and the vocal cords are again unable to vibrate. Between these two
extremes there lies a whole range of vocal activity which depends on the measure of tension
applied to the vocal cords.
Two different states of the glottis have already been introduced: voiceless and voiced.
Table 28.1 Lists some of the states of the glottis introduced in this lesson; however, not all
states of the glottis have official symbols to represent them, and some diacritics have multiple
functions.

The states of the glottis introduced in this lesson are conditions that can apply to all
vowels and to many consonants. Except for whispered, all of the states of the glottis have
been found to contrast word meanings in languages throughout the world. They are also
often applied as speech styles, affecting the articulation of speech as a whole.
For each different state of the glottis, specific diacritics are added to the base symbol.
The following chart gives the diacritics for each state.

Voiceless
The voiceless state occurs when the vocal cords are spread apart and relaxed so that
they do not vibrate. The air stream is allowed to pass through relatively unimpeded. The
most common voiceless sounds are consonants such as stops, fricatives, and sonorants,
although many languages contain voiceless vowels as well.
There are two ways to indicate that a sound is voiceless. Because the IPA is based on
European alphabets, some symbols are inherently voiceless, such as [f], [s], and [k]. Other
symbols, however, do not have voiced counterparts; therefore, voicelessness can be
represented by either placing an Under-ring [  ̥] beneath a symbol (for example, [ɑ̥]) or an
Over-ring [ ̊] above a symbol that has a descender (for example, [ŋ̊]).
Voiceless vowels are found in languages such as Japanese and several indigenous
North American languages.
320 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Breathy
Breathy sounds involve partial voicing. This occurs when the glottis is slightly more
tensed than for voiceless sounds, yet more relaxed than for voiced sounds. With the vocal
cords only slightly tensed, they remain far enough apart that the air stream is allowed to pass
through more freely than for voiced sounds, but still causes some vibration. Breathy voice is
perceived auditorily as being halfway between voiceless and voiced.
Breathiness can be found as a feature in both consonants and vowels. Vowels are the
most common breathy sounds, although certain languages in India have a set of breathy stops
as well. In many languages, breathy voice is used to distinguish meaning. It is also used as
an over all speech style. Breathy consonants will be studied in more depth in a later lesson.
The IPA symbolizes breathy voice by placing a Diaeresis [  ̤] beneath [ɑ̤] or above [y] a
symbol. If a breathy vowel exists whose quality is predictable, such as one that always
precedes and matches a voiced vowel, the Hooktop H [ɦ] can be used; that is, [ɑ̤ɑ] could be
represented as [ɦɑ].1
The following exercise contrasts breathy voice with other states of the glottis. Respond
by telling whether the pairs of utterances are the same or different.

To produce breathy sounds, exhale while holding the vocal cords in a relaxed manner
as they are for [h]. Tense them slightly until a small amount of voicing occurs. Make sure that
the vocal cords are more relaxed than for modal voice. Breathy voice can also be achieved by
imitating certain speech styles, such as “spookiness” or “sultry glamor.”

Breathy stops are often spoken of as voiced aspirated stops since the short, breathy
release of these sounds delays voice onset time, similar to aspiration. Describing these
sounds as voiced aspirated is technically a contradiction, however, because breathiness and
voicing are glottal states that cannot co-exist.
Voiced
Voiced phones are produced when the vocal cords have optimal tension applied to
them for a smooth and even vibration along their entire length. This is called modal voice.
Voiced sounds are common in every language. Voiced vowels are more common than vowels
with any other type of glottal activity.
Voicing is usually assumed to be an intrinsic quality of the base symbol. There is no
special diacritic to add voicing to an inherently voiceless symbol. Examples of voiced phones
are [b], [v], [ʒ] and [ɣ].
In the following exercise, respond by telling whether the vowels are breathy or voiced.

Creaky
Creaky voice involves a slower, more irregular vibration of the vocal cords than with
voiced sounds. This state of the glottis occurs when the vocal cords have increased tension
applied to them so that they cannot vibrate smoothly along their entire length. The glottis is
relaxed just enough so that the vocal cords do not close completely. If any more tension were
applied, a glottal stop would be formed. Creaky voice is characterized by a rough or forced
vocal resonance.
The creaky state of the glottis is sometimes used as an over all speech style in
languages like English, but it can be used to distinguish meaning as well. When used
contrastively, creaky voice is usually applied to vowels and other sonorants. Some major
languages that use creaky vowels contrastively are Burmese, Vietnamese, and Hmong.
The IPA symbolizes creaky voice by a Tilde [  ̰] beneath [ɑ̰] or [ɡ̃] above a symbol.2
Creaky voice is also referred to as laryngealization.

Stiff and Slack Voice
The Stiff voice state of the glottis occurs when the opening of the glottis and vocal
chords are stiffer than normal. No official symbol has been chosen to represent stiff voice, but
a Subscript Wedge [ ̬] or a Superscript Wedge [ ̌] is often used for this purpose (for example,
[ɑb̬ɑ]).3
The opposite of stiff voice is slack voice (also called lax voice). Slack voice occurs
when the opening vocal chords is slightly wider than normal. Though no official symbol
exists for the slack voice state of the glottis, the Under-ring [ ̥] and Over-ring [ ̊] are
frequently used (for example [ɑb̥ɑ]). This can cause confusion because these symbols usually
represent voicelessness. If these diacritics occur with a voiceless consonant or a voiced
consonant that has a voiceless counterpart, they will likely indicate slack voice. As with stiff
voice, and slack voice only occurs in consonants.
English speakers often find it difficult to identify stiff and slack voice consonants from
their modal voiced and voiceless counterparts. Many Asian languages contrast slack and stiff
voice along with other states of the glottis.
Whisper
The whispered state of the glottis occurs when the vocal cords are tensed too much to
allow them to vibrate, yet a small space is left between them through which air is allowed to
pass. This state of the glottis applies mostly to vowels and a few other sonorants.
3 The Subscript Wedge [ ̬] officially indicates voicing, but it is rarely used for this purpose since most symbols
have a voiced counterpart (for example, a voiced palatal lateral fricative could be symbolized as [̬]).
Lesson 28: States of the Glottis 325
Whispered vowels are auditorily similar to voiceless vowels in that there is no vocal
resonance. The restriction to the air stream, however, causes them to have a hissing sound
not present in voiceless vowels. Many people learning to produce voiceless vowels have a
tendency to say whispered vowels instead.
Although whispering occurs quite commonly as a speech style, it is not used in the
normal speech of any language. Therefore, whispering is not normally transcribed.
However, the IPA extension diacritic Dot Below [  ̣] is used to indicated whispering in speech
pathology (for example, [ɑ̣]).
Glottal Closure
If the glottis is tensed even further than for a whisper, a state is eventually reached in
which the vocal cords are drawn so tightly together that no air can pass between them. This
state corresponds with the conditions required to produce a glottal stop, although the glottal
stop is not technically a state of the glottis. The glottal stop is a separate consonant which
uses the vocal cords as its articulator.
The glottal state of complete closure is the exact opposite of that of voicelessness, since
for voiceless sounds the vocal cords are relaxed and apart. However, sounds made with this
state of the glottis, like the glottal stop for example, will be perceived auditorily as voiceless
since no air passes through the vocal cords.
States of the Glottis as Speech Styles
Each of the states of the glottis introduced in this lesson can be applied not only to
individual segments or syllables, but also to speech as a whole. Any specific phonetic
characteristic that is applied to speech as a whole, and is not used to distinguish the meaning
of individual words, is called a speech style. The breathy, voiced, creaky, and whispered
glottal states occur quite frequently in English as speech styles. Other speech styles will be
introduced later in this course.

328 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Implosives are sounds which involve an ingressive air stream, i.e., an air stream that
moves inward. The concept of the air stream was introduced in Lesson 1. Without the
movement of air in the vocal tract, no speech sounds could occur. The muscles or organs that
set that air in motion are called air stream mechanisms. There are three different air stream
mechanisms in the speech tract, each capable of moving air either outward or inward. These
mechanisms are the lungs, the glottis, and the tongue. For all of the phones drilled so far in
this course, the air stream originates in the lungs and is moved outward by the diaphragm
and muscles of the rib cage. This type of air stream is called egressive pulmonic. For
implosive sounds, the air stream is set in motion by the glottis and moves inward. This is
described as ingressive glottalic air.
Implosives occur contrastively in approximately 10–15% of the world’s languages.
Stops are the most common implosive sounds, but some languages contain implosive
affricates as well.
The IPA indicates that a sound is implosive with an upper right hook on the base
symbol (for example [ɓ]). The official symbols for voiceless implosive stops do not
correspond with those for egressive voiceless stops. Voiceless implosives are represented by
placing an Under-ring [  ̥ ] beneath or an Over-ring [ ̊] above the symbol for the voiced
implosive at the same point of articulation (for example, [ɓ̥] or [ɠ̊ ]).1
The following chart gives
the implosive symbols that will be drilled in this lesson.
Table 29.1: Implosives
Bilabial Tip-Alveolar Mid-Palatal Back-Velar Back-Uvular
Voiceless ɓ̥ ɗ̥ ʄ̥ ɠ̊ ʛ̥
Voiced ɓ ɗ ʄ ɠ ʛ
Most of the symbol names are intuitive. The bilabial implosive is Hooktop B [ɓ], and
the alveolar implosive is Hooktop D [ɗ]. The symbol for the palatal implosive is a bit
ambiguous, but it is usually considered a Hooktop Barred Dotless J [ʄ]. The velar and uvular
implosives are Hooktop G [ɠ] and Hooktop Small Capital G [ʛ] respectively.
For the articulation of a voiceless implosive consonant, the glottis must be completely
closed while at the same time there is a complete closure in the oral cavity, as for a stop. The
glottis is pulled downward, which rarefies2
the air between the glottis and the articulators.
1 The IPA had dedicated symbols for voiceless implosives (i.e., [ƥ] [ƭ] [ƈ] [ƙ] [ʠ]), but they were withdrawn in
1993.
2 Rarification is the opposite of compression. It is used in linguistics to describe a partial vacuum condition
between two articulations.
Lesson 29: Implosives 329
When the articulation is released, a sudden burst of air rushes inward to fill the vacuum
created by the downward movement of the glottis. Illustration 29.1 pictures the action of the
glottis and the direction of the air stream for a voiceless implosive.
Voiced implosives are more common than their voiceless counterparts. For voiced
implosives to occur, there must be enough air passing through the vocal cords to produce
vibrations. For this to occur, the glottis is not completely closed while it is being pulled
downward, as it is for voiceless implosives. This allows enough egressive pulmonic air to
escape upward between the vocal cords to produce voicing. Thus, voiced implosives actually
use a combination of ingressive glottalic air and egressive pulmonic air. Illustration 29.2
pictures voiced implosive articulation.
Illustration 29.1: Voiceless
Implosive [ɠ̊ ]
Illustration 29.2: Voiced
Implosive [ɠ]
Producing Implosives
Most people find voiced implosives easier to produce than voiceless ones. To start
with the voiced velar implosive [ɠ], try to imitate the “glug, glug” of water being poured from
a bottle: [ɠəʔ ɠəʔ ɠəʔ ɠəʔ].
In the same way, you may be able to produce the voiced velar implosive [ɠ] by
imitating the croaking of a bull frog: [ɠəʔ ɠəʔ ɠəʔ ɠəʔ] If this helps you to articulate the
velar implosive, try the other implosives [ɓ], [ɗ], [ʄ], and [ʛ] by analogy.
To produce voiceless implosives, try whispering the exercises above. Practice this until
you can do it with [ɓ̥], [ɗ̥], [ʄ̥], [ɠ̊ ], and [ʛ̥], then work on using voiced vowels between the
voiceless implosives.
330 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Practice saying the sentences after the recording in the following exercise. Practice
these until the implosive sounds come naturally for you.

Recognizing Implosives
Throughout this course, most of the implosive sounds are articulated clearly and put
between vowels for easier recognition. In actual languages, however, the implosives may not
be articulated as distinctly, or may be surrounded by other sounds that disguise their
distinctive sound. In such cases the implosives will be harder to recognize. In the following
exercise, practice recognizing implosives by stating whether each pair of utterances are the
same or different.

Many people learning to articulate implosives for the first time have a tendency to
produce instead a consonant cluster consisting of a glottal stop and an egressive stop instead.
Even if there is no trouble producing them, hearing the difference between implosives and
such consonant clusters when the implosives are lightly articulated can be difficult, as in
either case glottal closure in involved. The utterances in the following exercise contain
implosives and other consonant clusters. Listen to each utterance and tell whether the stops
you hear are implosives or a consonant clusters. Do not follow the text.

336 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
You may be more familiar with some phonetic features than others based on whether
or not they are common in your native language. The breathy consonants reviewed in this
lesson will be easy to identify, but much more difficult to produce. English speakers
sometimes produce breathy consonants, but only when mimicking a specific speech style. It
is never used to distinguish meaning. In some languages however, the difference between
two words could be the breathiness of a single consonant. Once learned, this feature will go a
long way to improving your speech skills in languages where it is contrastive.
Breathy Consonants
Breathy sounds are produced when the vocal cords are more relaxed than for modal
voice, allowing a greater volume of air to flow through with less vibration. This state of the
glottis was introduced with vowels in Lesson 28. Breathy voice can be applied to consonants
as well. Nearly any voiced sound can also be produced with breathy voice. Breathy voice
involves some audible vocal activity, but not as much as for modal voice. Consonants
produced with breathy voice are characterized by a windy quality.
Breathy stops are very important in several languages of India and Nepal, where they
are often used contrastively to distinguish word meanings. In English, breathiness is usually
an over all speech style. Breathy consonants are also referred to as murmured consonants.
As mentioned previously, the diacritic for breathy consonants is a Diaeresis [  ̤] below
[b̤] or above [gp] a voiced symbol. A breathy stop or affricate may also be written with a
Superscript Hooktop H [ʱ], such as [bʱ], because most linguists consider voiced aspiration
identical to breathiness. For simplicity, the Diaeresis will be used throughout the remainder
of this chapter.
Table 30.1 below lists a few examples of breathy consonant symbolization.

Breathy Nasals m̤ n̤ ñ̤ ɳp ɲp ŋp ɴ̤
The effect of breathiness on voiced stops is very similar to that of aspiration on
voiceless ones in that it delays the full onset of voicing. Some linguists, therefore, refer to
breathy stops as voiced aspirated stops. The voiced and breathy glottalic states, however, are
Lesson 30: Breathy Consonants and Consonant Clusters
337
two separate conditions that cannot co-exist. The vocal cords vibrate evenly along their entire
length during voiced sounds. During a breathy sound, however, the front part of the vocal
cords vibrate loosely, while in the back the vocal cords are spread apart and do not vibrate at
all. For this reason, breathy stops should not be described as voiced aspirated.
Producing Breathy Consonants
Continuants, such as fricatives, nasals, and laterals, are not difficult to produce with
breathy voice. The glottal activity involved in producing these consonants is no different
than that of breathy vowels. The glottis must be relaxed slightly more than for normal
voicing so that the air stream passes through more freely. Breathy stops, however, can be
more challenging to produce since the flow of the air stream is interrupted. Most of the drills
in this lesson are dedicated to practicing breathy stops.
To produce breathy stops, relax the glottis and say a voiced stop while expelling more
air than usual from the lungs. This should result in a puff of air similar to aspiration on a
voiceless stop. Be careful not to add so much extra air that it adds another syllable to the
utterance, as in [bəhɑ].
Say the word “rabbit” with a voiced stop, then add an [h] after the [b]. Combine the
two sounds until you can pronounce the [b] as a breathy stop, then replace [b̤] with breathy
stops [d̤] and [gp]. Follow the transcription in the next exercise and repeat each utterance after
the recording.

Recognizing Breathy Consonants
Breathy consonants are characterized by a softer quality then their voiced counterparts.
They may be thought of as having a windy or half whispered sound. Breathy speech is also
often associated with spookiness or sultry glamor.

One mistake that learners often make when producing breathy stops is
over-emphasizing the breathiness, adding an [h] after the stop. This adds an extra syllable to
the original sound. Care must be taken to make a smooth transition from the breathy stop to
the voiced vowel without breaking up the syllable pattern. Practice recognizing incorrect
transitions in the next exercise. Respond by telling whether each utterance contains one
syllable or two.

Consonant Clusters
A cluster is a group of adjacent sounds which are of the same phonetic category and
have no intervening or transitional sounds. Therefore, a consonant cluster consists of two or
more consecutive consonants with no intervening vowels or semivowels.
Consonant clusters can be very difficult to pronounce. Whether a combination of
consonants is difficult for you to produce or not depends largely on your native language
habits. In some languages, the majority of consonants are clustered, while in others
consonant clusters rarely occur. In this lesson several types of clusters will be introduced to
improve your awareness of the different combinations you may encounter.
A consonant cluster may be composed of a series of consonants of any manner of
articulation, or a mixture of several manners. Affricates are a type of consonant cluster
consisting of a stop followed by a fricative. Longer clusters involving more manners of
articulation will be drilled in this lesson.
Recognizing Consonant Clusters
You will remember from Lesson 27 that it is very common for a short vowel such as
schwa to occur between voiced consonants, especially stops. At times, sequences of
consonants will be encountered which sound very similar to consonant clusters, but the
consonants are actually separated by a transitional element such as a short vowel or an
approximant release. It is important to be able to determine whether a group of sounds is
really a consonant cluster or not. In the following exercise, practice distinguishing consonant
clusters from sequences broken up by vowels and approximants. Respond to each utterance
by determining if the group of consonants is a consonant cluster or not. Answer with
“consonant cluster” or “no.”

Lesson 30: Breathy Consonants and Consonant Clusters
341
A consonant cluster can be either monosyllabic or polysyllabic based on the number
and type of consonants included. In the English word “strengths,” transcribed [stɹeŋθs],
there are two consonant clusters even though the word consist of only one syllable. Now
consider the Salish word [xɬpʼχʷɬtʰɬpʰɬːskʷʰt͡sʼ], which means “He possessed a bunchberry
plant.” Even though this word consists of several syllables, the entire utterance is one
consonant cluster since there are no vowels separating the consonants. The syllable
boundaries occurring between the consonants do not interrupt the continuity of the cluster.
Notice, however, that in a polysyllabic cluster, each syllable must contain a sonorant or some
similar continuant to carry the syllable beat.
In the following exercise, practice identifying how many syllables each consonant
cluster contains. Respond by giving the number of syllables.

Ejective....................................................344
344 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Ejectives are sounds which involve an egressive glottalic air stream. The concept of
glottalic air stream was introduced in Lesson 29. Glottalic air is set in motion by the glottis
and can move either outward or inward. The implosive sounds studied in Lesson 29 involve
ingressive glottalic air, which means that the glottis moves downward and draws air inward.
Ejectives are just the opposite. The glottis is completely closed and at the same time there is a
closure in the oral cavity. When the glottis moves upward, the air between the glottis and the
articulators is compressed. As the articulation is released this pressurized air is rapidly
expelled from the oral cavity, creating an ejective puff of air. Ejectives are also referred to as
explosives or glottalized consonants.
Most ejectives in the languages of the world are ejective stops. Some languages also
have ejective affricates, and a few have have ejective fricatives.
Ejectives are found in about 20% of languages in the world. They are common
languages as diverse as Thai, Georgian, Qhechua, and several languages indigenous to North
America.
Ejectives are represented by placing an Apostrophe [’] after a voiceless consonant (for
example, [t’], [ts’], or [x’]). The following chart gives symbols for the ejective sounds
introduced in this lesson. This chart is by no means exhaustive. Nearly all stops and
affricates, as well as a few fricatives, can be produced as ejectives.
Table 31.1 lists some examples of ejective consonants. Many other ejectives occur in
spoken languges. Also, ejective affricates can be hetorogranic, but for simplicity, only
homorganic affricates are listed below.

Ejective Fricatives ɸ’ s’ ʃ’ ʂ’ ç’ x’ χ’
Ejective Affricates pɸ’ ts’ t ̠ʃ’ ʈʂ’ cç’ kx’ qχ’
Ejectives are unlike implosives in that the vocal cords must be completely closed while
the glottis is being raised to compress the air stream. It is impossible, therefore, to articulate a
voiced ejective, since no air passes between the vocal cords during ejective articulation. It is
also important to note that the velic must be closed during the articulation of an ejective.
The following facial diagrams compare the articulation of [t], [t’], and [ʔ]. Notice that
for [t’], the glottis is closed and the air stream arrow is drawn through the vocal cords. This
indicates that the glottis is the air stream mechanism.

Illustration 31.2:

Glottal Stop [ʔ]
Producing Ejectives
Learning to produce ejectives is relatively easy. Stops are probably the easiest sounds
to learn as ejectives. Remember to practice only with voiceless sounds, as it is not possible to
produce a voiced ejective.
Watch your instructor produce several ejective stops. Notice how the larynx is raised
just before the release of the consonant. You can practice this muscle movement by
pretending to spit a small bit of grass off the tip of your tongue. Protrude your tongue tip
between your lips and draw it in sharply, blowing the imaginary fragment away. If you can
produce a glottalic air stream like this, try doing the same with [p], [t], and [k].
Hold your breath and say [k] several times in a row, loud enough so that someone
sitting next to you could hear it.
Another suggestion is to expel all of the air from your lungs and then try to say [k].
This will result in using the glottis to produce the air necessary for this sound.
Repeat the following set of sentences after the recording, pronouncing all of the
voiceless stops as ejectives.

Recognizing Ejectives
Ejectives are usually distinguishable by the sharp burst of air that accompanies their
release. This burst is a characteristic of the glottalic air stream that produces ejectives.
It is not usually difficult to distinguish between ejectives and voiced pulmonic stops.
Ejectives may easily be confused, however, with voiceless unaspirated stops. Practice
identifying the ejectives in the following exercise. Respond to each pair of utterances by
telling whether they are the same or different.

350 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Changing the size and shape of the pharyngeal cavity affects how vowels and other
sonorants resonate, thus changing their quality of sound. The size and shape of the
pharyngeal cavity is affected by the position of the tongue root. If the tongue root is pushed
farther forward than normal, the size of the pharyngeal cavity is expanded. Likewise, if the
tongue root is pulled farther backward than normal, the pharyngeal cavity becomes smaller.
Understanding the positions of the tongue root, therefore, are important in knowing how
sonorants are produced and modified. Tongue root placement describes how the root of the
tongue is positioned in relationship to the pharyngeal walls and the position of the larynx.
There are three recognized positions of the tongue root. They are advanced tongue
root, neutral tongue root, and retracted tongue root. Vowels with different tongue root
placement have been found contrastively in several African and Asian languages.
The following facial diagram illustrates the position of the tongue for advanced,
neutral, and retracted tongue root.
Illustration 32.1: Advanced, Neutral, and Retracted Tongue Root
The positions of the tongue root are symbolized by subscript diacritics, [ɑ̘] or [ɑ̙],
beneath the base symbol pointing to the direction in which the tongue is moved. Neutral
tongue root is considered the normal or default position of the tongue and is left unmarked.
Lesson 32: Tongue Root Placement 351
Advanced Tongue Root
Advanced tongue root occurs when the pharyngeal cavity is enlarged by moving the
base of the tongue forward, away from the back of the throat. Advanced tongue root is
symbolized by placing a Tack Left [ ̘] below a symbol, such as [ɑ̘]. The larynx is usually
lowered as well. Advanced tongue root is abbreviated +ATR .
Producing Sounds with Advanced Tongue Root
When a voice teacher asks a student to “open up” for a richer tone, advanced tongue
root is actually the condition desired. To produce sounds with advanced tongue root, try
saying a vowel while practicing anything that makes the pharyngeal cavity larger such as
lowering the jaw or changing the shape of the tongue. You may try lowering your larynx to
get a “woofy” sound.
It may also help to practice saying vowels while yawning. This pushes the tongue root
forward, opening up the pharyngeal cavity more than for a normal vowel.
Practice the following sequence of vowels with neutral and advanced tongue root
position. Pay particular attention to the forward and backward movement of the tongue root.

Recognizing Sounds with Advanced Tongue Root
Vowels produced with advanced tongue root are usually characterized by a hollow
sound. Advanced tongue root vowels often involve breathy voice as well, and usually have a
lower pitch.
Practice identifying advanced tongue root in the following exercise. Respond after
each pair of utterances by telling whether they are the same or different.

Neutral Tongue Root
Neutral tongue root occurs when the tongue root is in its most relaxed, natural
position for speech. This position is directly between that of advanced and retracted tongue
root and is considered to be the normal or default tongue root position for most speech
sounds.
All of the vowels which have been introduced in previous lessons are produced with
neutral tongue root. The position of the tongue varies slightly, however, depending on the
vowel being produced.
Retracted Tongue Root
Retracted tongue root involves moving the tongue root farther back toward the rear of
the pharyngeal wall than its normal position for vowels. This reduces the size of the
pharyngeal cavity, altering the vowel’s original quality. This tongue root position is actually
partial pharyngealization and may sometimes border on full pharyngealization.
Lesson 32: Tongue Root Placement 353
Retracted tongue root is abbreviated −ATR. The IPA symbolizes retracted tongue root
with a subscript Right Tack [ ̙], such as [ɑ̙]. This diacritic is the exact opposite of that used to
denote advanced tongue root.
Producing Sounds with Retracted Tongue Root
Retracted tongue root vowels are produced by constricting the pharyngeal cavity with
the root of the tongue. This can be done by beginning from the position of the pharyngeal
fricative Reversed Glottal Stop [ʕ], for which the tongue root is the articulator, and partially
opening the gap between the tongue root and the back of the throat.
Another way to learn to produce retracted tongue root vowels is to pretend you are
choking on the back of your tongue while pronouncing a vowel.
Practice the following sequence of vowels with neutral and retracted tongue root
positions. Pay particular attention to the forward and backward movement of the tongue
root.

356 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Remember that for a consonant to be produced, it is necessary for an articulator to
approach near enough to a point of articulation that the air stream is significantly modified or
obstructed. During the production of most consonants, only one articulator is active. It is
possible, however, for more than one articulator to be engaged at the same time, creating a
condition known as co-articulated consonants. One type of co-articulated consonants, known
as double articulation, was introduced in Lesson 26. Another type of co-articulated
consonants, called secondary articulation, involves both a primary and a secondary
articulator. While the primary articulator forms the main consonant, an additional articulator
also shapes or modifies the air stream, forming a secondary consonant simultaneous with the
first.
Consider the English word “view.” Notice how during the initial [v] the blade of the
tongue is raised toward the hard palate forming the approximant [j]. This is an example of
secondary articulation since both sounds occur simultaneously. Contrast this with the [v] in
the word “voodoo,” where the secondary articulation is absent.
Primary and secondary articulations differ in their manner of articulation. The
primary consonant is usually a sound which involves significant air stream modification,
such as a stop, fricative, or nasal. The secondary consonant is usually a more open sound,
such as an approximant. The secondary articulation therefore always sounds less prominent
than the primary consonant, since there is less impedance. Both the primary and secondary
articulation share the same voicing characteristics. Either both sounds are voiced or both are
voiceless.
There are six common secondary articulations. These are termed labialization,
palatalization, velarization, labial-palatalization, labial-velarization, and pharyngealization.
All involve approximant articulation.
Secondary articulations are represented by placing a superscript approximant symbol
of the appropriate place of articulation after the symbol of the primary consonant. A
palatalized [d], for example, is represented as [dʲ]. When a consonant must have a series of
superscript symbols, such as an ejective apostrophe or aspiration in addition to secondary
articulation, the symbol of the secondary articulation belongs closest to the base consonant
symbol, for example [pʷʰ]. The following chart gives the symbols for the six secondary
articulations. Note that some symbols have multiple meanings.
Lesson 33: Secondary Articulations 357
Table 33.1: Secondary Articulators
Symbol Point(s) of Articulation
ʷ Labial
ʲ Palatal
ˠ Velar
ᶣ Palatal, Velar
ʷ Labial, Velar
ˤ Pharyngeal
Primary and secondary articulations can be released either simultaneously or
sequentially. Secondary articulations are usually released after the primary consonant, giving
the sound a strong glided quality. A secondary articulation consisting of an approximant,
therefore, may sound very much like a vowel glide.
It is important to distinguish between a secondary articulation and a double
articulation. A secondary articulation always sounds less prominent and its manner of
articulation is always different from that of its primary consonant. In a double articulation,
on the other hand, both consonants share the same manner of articulation and are of equal or
nearly equal prominence.
Labialization
Labialization occurs when the lips are rounded during the articulation of a separate
primary consonant. This occurs in the English words “quick” [kʷwɪk] and “Guam” [gʷwɑm].
Notice in these words how the lips round while the first consonant is pronounced. This
rounding of the lips before the [w] approximant is labialization.
Labialization is symbolized by placing a Superscript W [ʷ] after the main consonant
symbol. It should be noted that the W [w] is actually a double articulated labial-velar
approximant, but the Superscript W [ʷ] can represent both labialization and
labial-velarization. The latter will be discussed later on, but it is important to remember not
to raise the back of the tongue unnecessarily when labializing a phone.
All consonants, including bilabials, can be labialized by simply rounding the lips. The
following facial diagrams illustrate a [k] both with and without labialization. Notice in the
358 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
diagram of [kʷ], that the labialization involves much less restriction than the primary
articulation [k].
Illustration 33.1: [k] Illustration 33.2: Labialized [kʷ]
Producing Labialization
Producing labialized consonants is usually easy. Simply round the lips while saying
the primary sound. Remember that the articulation may be released simultaneously or
sequentially. A sequential release is very similar in sound to a vowel glide. In the following
exercise, focus on releasing both articulations simultaneously. Repeat each utterance after the
recording.

Recognizing Labialization
Labialization is characterized by a rounded quality that affects the sound of the
primary consonant. Since labialization sounds similar to a vowel glide, it is often easier to
recognize labialization by sight than by sound. Practice recognizing labialization in the
following exercise. Listen to each pair of utterances and respond by telling whether they are
the same or different.

in an approximant, more of the labialized sound comes after the consonant. In the following
exercise, some of the consonants are labialized while others are followed by approximants or
vowel glides. Respond after each pair of utterances by telling whether they are the same or
different.

Palatalization
Palatalization involves raising the blade of the tongue toward the hard palate during a
primary articulation. Palatalization produces the approximant [j] as the secondary sound.
The initial “v” in the English word “view” [vʲju] is an example of palatalization. Palatalized
sounds are very common in Russian, where they are referred to as soft consonants.
Palatalization is symbolized by placing a Superscript J [ʲ] after the main consonant symbol.
Nearly any phone can be palatalized, with the exception of certain pharyngeal
consonants and palatal consonants since the palatal place of articulation is already engaged.
The following facial diagrams depict [m] with and without palatalization. Notice that
for [mʲ] the blade of the tongue is near the hard palate.
Illustration 33.3: [m] Illustration 33.4: Palatalized [mʲ]
Lesson 33: Secondary Articulations 361
Producing Palatalization
To produce a palatalized sound, form a primary articulation and then raise the blade of
the tongue toward the hard palate as for the approximant [j]. Another way to learn to
palatalize sounds is to think about saying the vowel [i] at the same time you say the primary
consonant.
Practice the palatalized sounds in the following exercise. Repeat each sound after the
recording.

3. kʲeen kʲatherine kʲan kʲick a kʲranky kʲing.
Recognizing Palatalization
Palatalization is usually released after the primary consonant. This makes the
palatalization sound very similar to an [i] or [ɨ] glide or the approximant [j]. Notice in the
word “view” that the glided sound continues after the [v] is released.
The following exercise contains both palatalized and non-palatalized consonants.

Velarization
For velarization, the back of the tongue is raised toward the velum, similar to the
articulation of the close back unrounded vowel, Turned M [ɯ]. The Dark l [ɫ] is an English
example of velarization because the tip of the tongue touches the alveolar ridge and the back
of the tongue approaches the velum. This changes the shape of the oral cavity, modifying the
Lesson 33: Secondary Articulations 363
over all sound of the primary consonant. Velarized sounds are common in Russian and are
referred to as hard consonants.
The only consonants which can be velarized are those whose articulators are toward
the front of the oral cavity. Consonants produced at the velar point of articulation cannot be
velarized because the velar point of articulation is already engaged.
Velarization is represented by placing a Superscript Gamma [ˠ] after the symbol of the
primary consonant, such as [dˠ]. Another method of representation, used most frequently
with laterals, is to place a Middle Tilde [~] through the main symbol, as in the Dark L [ɫ].
However, the Middle Tilde can indicate either velarization or pharyngealization.
The following facial diagrams illustrate a velarized and a non-velarized [d]. Notice
that the velar closure is not close enough to create a fricative.
Illustration 33.5: [d] Illustration 33.6: Velarized
[dˠ]
Producing Velarization
For velarization, the position of the back of the tongue is similar to that of the vowels U
[u] and Turned M [ɯ], as well as that of the labial-velar approximant [w]. One difficulty when
learning to velarize sounds is to keep from rounding your lips. Practice keeping your lips
unrounded while saying English words that have [w] approximants, such as “twinkle,”
“swing,” and “Dwight.”
Practice velarizing consonants in the following exercise. Repeat each utterance after
the recording.

Recognizing Velarization
Velarization does not involve lip rounding, so it should be fairly easy to distinguish
between velarization and approximants and vowel glides. Because velarization is created
with the back of the tongue behind the primary articulator (i.e., the tip of the tongue), it will
be more difficult to distinguish it from ordinary non-velarized sounds.
The following exercise contains velarized and non-velarized consonants. Listen to
each pair of utterances and respond by telling whether they are the same or different.

Labial-Palatalization
As its name suggests, labial-palatalization involves both labialization and
palatalization at the same time. For this to occur, the lips must be rounded and the blade of
the tongue raised toward the hard palate at the same time that the primary articulated
consonant is produced. Labial-palatalization is represented by a Superscript Turned H [ᶣ]
after the main consonant, as in [dᶣ]. As you may remember, the Turned H [ɥ] is a labial-palatal
approximant.
Any sound that can be palatalized can also be labial-palatalized. Facial diagrams of
labial-palatalized sounds are not included as no new articulator configuration is introduced.
Producing Labial-Palatalization
If you can produce labialization and palatalization separately, it should not be difficult
to combine them to produce labial-palatalized sounds. Since the close front rounded vowel
[y] involves lip rounding and a slight palatal closure, it may help to think of producing this
vowel at the same time as a primary articulation.
Follow the transcription in the following exercise and repeat each utterance after the
recording.

3. kᶣeen kᶣatherine kᶣan kᶣick a kᶣranky kᶣing.
Recognizing Labial-Palatalization
Labial-palatalization usually involves a delayed release much like that of
palatalization. This gives the secondary articulation a strong glided sound.
Labial-palatalization is often characterized by a sound similar to the close front rounded
vowel [y].
It can be very easy to confuse labial-palatalization with either palatalization or
labialization. The following exercise contains all three secondary articulations. Practice
identifying the labial-palatalized sounds. Respond to each pair of utterances by telling
whether they are the same or different.

Labial-Velarization
Labial-velarization also involves two simultaneous secondary articulations. For this
type of secondary articulation, the lips are rounded and the back of the tongue is raised at the
velar point. In essence, this manner of secondary articulation simply combines the
labialization and velarization introduced earlier in this chapter.
As with velarization, only sounds made toward the front of the mouth can be
labial-velarized. All consonants that can be velarized can also be labial-velarized.
As mentioned earlier, labial-velarization is symbolized with a Superscript W [ʷ] after
the main symbol, such as [kʷ], which is the same as labialization. The reason for this is that it
is very unlikely for labial-velarization and labialization to be used contrastively, therefore
most linguists do not bother to differentiate between these two types of secondary
articulation.
Producing Labial-Velarization
To produce labial-velarization, think of saying the W [w] approximant or a close back
rounded vowel U [u] at the same time as a primary articulation. Make sure that your lips are
as rounded as they should be for [w] and [u]. Remember to practice labial-velarization with
consonants produced toward the front of the oral cavity.
Practice saying the labial-velarized sounds in the following exercise. Repeat each
sound after the recording.

Pharyngealization
Pharyngealization involves retracting the root of the tongue toward the back of the
throat, as for a pharyngeal approximant. This manner of secondary articulation is very
similar to velarization, except that it occurs farther back in the vocal tract.
Pharyngealization is symbolized by placing a Superscript Reverse Glottal Stop [ˤ]
after the base consonant symbol, for example [dˤ]. The Reverse Glottal Stop [ʕ] is a
pharyngeal fricative. The following facial diagrams illustrate the articulation of a
non-pharyngealized [d] and pharyngealized [dˤ].
Lesson 33: Secondary Articulations 369
Illustration 33.7: [d] Illustration 33.8:
Pharyngealized [dˤ]
Producing Pharyngealization
The position of the tongue for pharyngealization is very similar to retracted tongue
root placement. The root of the tongue is close enough to the back wall of the pharynx to
restrict the air stream, but not close enough to create much friction. When producing
pharyngealization, it may be helpful to think of choking yourself with your tongue while
pronouncing the primary articulation.
Practice the pharyngealized sounds in the following exercise. Repeat each utterance
after the recording.

374 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Fortis and lenis articulation involves the intensity of articulation, or the amount of
articulatory strength applied to an individual consonant. This distinction does not involve a
new manner of articulation, but rather added conditions that can be applied to any of the
consonants already studied in this course.
Fortis and Lenis Articulation
The distinction between fortis and lenis articulation is a combination of several
articulatory conditions such as tenseness of the articulators, varied air pressure, length, varied
degrees of voicing, and length of aspiration. Depending on the language and the phonetic
environment, there are often variations in exactly which of these conditions determine the
difference between fortis and lenis consonants.
In English, voiced stops are more often lenis while voiceless stops tend to be fortis.
This difference can be heard when the words “fan” and “van” are whispered in a sequence.
Although the whispered state of the glottis eliminates all voicing, the “f” and “v” are still
distinguishable. Although many phonological factors are involved, the fortis/lenis condition
of these sounds help make this distinction possible.
Symbolizing Fortis and Lenis
Neither fortis nor lenis are normally symbolized in written transcription. This is
because there is no single phonological element that defines fortis or lenis. Rather, it is the
general impression to the hearer that a sound is stronger (fortis) or weaker (lenis). Although
the IPA has no dedicated symbol which represents fortis and lenis, the IPA extension symbol
for strong articulation Double Vertical Lines [  ͈] is often placed below or above a symbol to
indicate fortis (for example, [t͈] or [ɡ̎]).1
The APA lenis diacritic, Scribble [ ], is still in common
use among linguists today, and can be placed above or below a consonant to indicate lenis
articulation (for example, [n] or [ç]). Occasionally, the IPA extension diacritic for weak
articulation Corner Below [  ͉] is also used to for lenis, such as [t͉].
Alternatively, fortis and lenis are contrasted by lengthening or doubling a phonetic
symbol. For example, [pː sː nː] or [pp ss nn] could represent fortis articulation and [p s n]
could represent lenis in this case. It is also common to use the voiceless diacritics with voiced
symbols to indicate lenis articulation. For example, if fortis articulation were transcribed as
[p k s], lenis articulation would be [b̥ g̊ z̥]. However, this notation is identical to slack voice
notation and, therefore, could be confusing.
1 The Double Vertical Lines [ ͈] diacritic is also used to indicate faucalized supra-glottal phonation.
Lesson 34: Fortis and Lenis Articulation 375
Producing Fortis and Lenis Consonants
Fortis articulation is produced when the the organs of the speech tract move with
greater energy or force than usual. It also involves an increased build-up of air pressure
behind the articulators, which can produce the various articulatory conditions that were
mentioned above. In producing fortis consonants, try to make the entire articulation more
tensed than normal without relying on a single phonetic feature such as voicing or aspiration
to create the distinction.
Lenis articulation is produced in just the opposite way of fortis articulation. The
muscles of the speech tract operate with somewhat lesser force, producing a condition in
which a consonant is perceived as being softer or less forceful. Try to make the articulatory
organ softer or more fluid to create this distinction. Again, do not rely simply on voicing or
aspiration to constitute lenis articulation.
In some languages, such as Korean, the difference between fortis and lenis articulation
is just as important as the difference between voicing and voicelessness. Korean contrasts
three different types of voiceless stops which include fortis, lenis, and aspirated. The Korean
words “daughter” [t͈ɑl], “moon” [tɑl], and “mask” [tʰɑl] are examples of contrastive fortis and
lenis articulation.2

Recognizing Fortis and Lenis Consonants
The acoustic differences between fortis and lenis consonants can be very subtle. When
learning to identify fortis and lenis consonants, keep in mind that this distinction is not
determined solely by aspiration or voicing, although variations of both of these conditions
may functions as contributors.
Fortis consonants are recognized by more forceful articulator movement and air
stream expulsion, while lenis consonants are just the opposite. The pairs of words in the
following exercise contrast fortis and lenis consonants. Listen carefully to each pair and
respond by telling whether they are the same or different.

380 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Clicks are speech sounds produced with a lingual ingressive air stream. Lingual
ingressive air is set in motion by the tongue and moves inward. Clicks are the only sounds
produced with lingual ingressive air.
To produce the lingual ingressive air stream necessary for clicks, the back of the tongue
is raised to form a complete closure at either the velar or uvular point of articulation. At the
same time, another stop is formed farther toward the front of the oral cavity by the tip of the
tongue or the lips. This forms a double stop, but rather than both articulations being released
at once, the body of the tongue is lowered or retracted, forming a partial vacuum between the
two closures. When the articulator in the front of the oral cavity is released, air rushes into
the mouth to fill the vacuum. This sudden burst of inward air creates the distinctive click
sound.
The closure at the back of the oral cavity is usually closer to the uvular point of articu-
lation than the velar point. This closure can also be produced with an open velic, resulting in
nasal clicks. The consonant articulated more toward the front of the oral cavity may be re-
leased either with a central release or a lateral release, making lateral clicks possible as well.
Although clicks could be pronounced at any point in a word, they are only found at the
beginning of syllables.
Clicks are contrastive within the alphabets of many languages of southern and eastern
Africa. In the Khoisan and Bantu language families, clicks are particularly prevalent. The
Xóõ language, for example, has fifty click phonemes. Nearly seventy percent of the words in
ǃ
the dictionary of this language begin with a click.
Clicks occur occasionally in English, although not as a part of normal words. Their use
in English is usually restricted to special expressions such as a show of pity (written as “tsk,
tsk, tsk”) or the noise sometimes used to get a horse to quicken its pace (often spelled
“tchlick”).
Table 35.1 lists the symbols for all the clicks found in the languages of the world. Not
all of these symbols have been officially added to the IPA, but they are listed here for
completeness. Only the most common clicks will be studied in detail.

represented by adding the appropriate nasal symbol before the click, such as [ŋʘ] or [ŋ̊ʘ].
Clicks can have many other phonetic features, such as aspiration [kǁʰ], breathy voice [gǂʱ], or
an ejective quality [qǀʼ]. Some of these features are even occasionally combined together. For
example, a click phoneme found in the Xóõ language contains ingressive nasal air flow and
ǃ
aspiration, transcribed as [↓ŋ̊ʘʰ]. Clicks can also be released into fricatives, such as [ǂx].
Any click from the chart above can be either voiced or voiceless. For voiced clicks, a
combination of lingual ingressive and pulmonic egressive air is used. As the click is articu-
lated, enough pulmonic air is allowed to pass through the vocal cords to produce voicing.
This air builds up behind the velar closure and is released after the release of the click. For
voiceless clicks, the lingual air stream is the only air in motion. Any of the voiceless clicks
presented can also be aspirated.
The following facial diagrams illustrate the articulation of voiced and voiceless
alveolar clicks. Notice the small arrow indicating the backward movement of the tongue.
Also notice that for the voiceless click there is no arrow below the glottis.
1 The Double Exclamation Point [‼] is also used to symbolize a retroflexed click.

Producing Clicks
Most of the clicks presented in this lesson are rather simple to produce. A bilabial
click, for example, is nothing more than a kiss, while the dental click [ǀ] is quite similar to the
expression “tsk, tsk, tsk.”
The action of the tongue that produces the inward air stream for clicks may be thought
of as a sucking action similar to that of a baby sucking a bottle. If this action is imitated while
saying [t], the result will be the alveolar click [ǃ]. Once the proper tongue action is achieved, it
is a simple matter to change the point of articulation to pronounce any of the clicks on the
chart above.
The clicks that will be studied below are the most common clicks in spoken languages.
These clicks are the bilabial click (symbolized by a Bull’s Eye [ʘ]), the dental click (called
Pipe [ǀ]), the alveolar or alveopalatal click (represented by an Exclamation Point [ǃ]), the
palatal or palatalalveolar click (called Double-barred Pipe [ǂ]), and the alveolar lateral click
(symbolized by a Double Pipe [ǁ]).
Voiceless clicks are the easiest to learn to produce. The following exercise contains
only voiceless clicks from the chart above. Follow the transcription and repeat each utterance
after the recording.

Recognizing Clicks
Clicks are distinctly characterized by a sharp popping sound created by the inward
rush of air at their release. Each click has a different type of pop based on the shape of the
tongue and the size of the cavity between the first and second closure. Alveolar and retro-
flexed clicks sound similar to a cork being pulled from an empty bottle. Some languages may
employ a speech style that lessens the sharpness of clicks.
Distinguishing clicks from other manners of articulation is not usually difficult. Dis-
tinguishing one click from another, however, may take some practice. The following exercise
contains voiced and voiceless clicks. Respond by telling whether the pairs of clicks are the
same or different.

388 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
In order to speak a language with a good accent, all of the phonetic segments and
variations which we have studied throughout this course must be carefully noted and
applied. Recognizing and reproducing the individual segments of a language, however, is
not enough to perfect a native-like accent. Each language is spoken with its own distinctive
style which is applied to speech as a whole and affects the sound of every phonetic segment
in an utterance. The articulatory variations which create these styles are called speech styles.
Speech styles are determined by the position and range of motion of the articulatory
organs as well as other variables such as volume, timing, glottal activity, and pitch
modulation. Most of these conditions and the symbolization for each have already been
introduced as applying to individual segments. As speech styles, however, they are used on a
broader spectrum, shading or coloring one’s entire speech. In some languages, for example, a
speaker may always have slightly rounded lips, or may always speak with fronted or backed
tongue. In another language, all of the sounds may be slightly retroflexed. While making no
difference in the meaning of words, these variations are very important for a good over-all
accent.
A language can employ more than one speech style at the same time. A rounded lip
style, for example, can occur together with breathiness, set jaw, or any speech style other than
one involving the lips.
Speech styles may be dictated by languages, dialects, speakers, moods, and social
environments. It is important to be aware of when speech styles are used to reflect the mood
or social situation of a speaker rather than as a characteristic of the language as a whole.
Once it has been determined that a certain speech style exists in a language, it is not
necessary to continue notations of the articulatory characteristic involved. However, it is
important to note speech styles and cite the situations where they are used.
The following list gives a short description of several possible articulatory conditions
that constitute common speech styles. This list is not exhaustive, however. Keep in mind that
nearly any condition that can accompany vowels and consonants can be used as a speech
style.
Position of the Tongue
Several speech styles can be created by the body of the tongue being placed either
forward or backward from its normal position while speaking. This subsequently causes all
of the consonants and vowels to be slightly more fronted or backed than what is considered
normal.
There are three main tongue positions that can be used as speech styles. These are
fronted tongue style, backed tongue style, and retroflexed tongue style.
Lesson 36: Speech Styles 389
Fronted tongue style involves speech produced with the body of the tongue held
farther forward than normal, while backed tongue style is just the opposite, with the tongue
being held farther toward the back of the throat. Retroflexed tongue style occurs when the tip
of the tongue remains slightly curled during normal speech. This results in each of the
consonants and vowels of the utterance having a retroflexed quality.
Practice producing the following sentences with each of the speech styles listed above.
Read the sentences first with fronted tongue style, then with backed tongue style, and finally
with retroflexed tongue style. Repeat each utterance after the recording.
Exercise 36.1: Producing Fronted, Backed, and Retroflexed Tongue Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
Position of the Lips
Another condition that affects speech is the shape of the lips. The lips may be either
spread, rounded, or squared. The spread and rounded lip configurations have already been
introduced.
The spread lip style is created when the lips are relatively flat and do not protrude at
all. This lip configuration is called unrounded when referring to vowels. Smiling when
speaking may help you produce this speech style.
The shape of the lips for rounded lip style corresponds directly to that of rounded
vowels. This speech style causes most of the consonants and even vowels which are normally
unrounded to have a measure of lip rounding.
The lips often take on a squared shape extra tightness causes them to protrude farther
than for normal lip rounding. This is called squared lip style.
Practice the spread, rounded, and squared lip speech styles with the following
sentences. Follow the transcription and repeat each sentence after the recording.
Exercise 36.2: Producing Spread, Rounded, and Squared Lip Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
390 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
Position of the Jaw
Languages also differ in the range of motion permitted to the jaw. If the jaw is allowed
to open freely with each articulation, the sounds will have an over all open quality. If the jaw
is limited in its vertical range of motion, the sounds of the language will have a restricted
quality. This condition may even cause vowel possibilities to be restricted to those with close
tongue position.
There are two different speech styles based on jaw movement. These are termed free
jaw style and set jaw style. For free jaw style, the jaw is allowed a wide range of motion for
articulation. For set jaw style, the movement of the jaw is restricted to a very narrow range of
motion.
Practice saying the following sentences, first with free jaw style and then with set jaw.
Exercise 36.3: Producing Free and Set Jaw Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
State of the Glottis
The states of the glottis were introduced in Lesson 28. Each of the glottal states except
whispered can be found contrastively in languages throughout the world. More often,
however, glottalic states are used as speech styles. In English, for example, breathy voice is
often used for telling spooky stories, while creaky voice is used as a speech style when one is
tired or physically strained.
Breathy voice, creaky voice, and whisper are all states of the glottis that are often used
as speech styles. The articulatory conditions that produce these styles have already been
discussed.
Practice saying the following sentences with breathy voice, creaky voice, and whisper.
Follow the transcription and repeat each sound after the recording.
Lesson 36: Speech Styles 391
Exercise 36.4: Producing Breathy, Creaky, and Whispered Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
Position of the Velic
The normal position of the velic can vary from one language to another. In some
languages, the velic is held in a closed position for all but nasal consonants. Other languages
tend to let the velic remain partly open more often than what may be considered normal,
giving more of the vowels and consonants a nasalized quality.
The speech styles which result from the positions of the velic are called nasalized style
and non-nasalized style. A language with non-nasalized style may have virtually no
nasalized vowels and fewer nasal consonants than most other languages. In languages with
nasalized style, the number of nasalized vowels and nasal consonants will be greater than
average.
Read the following sentences first with nasalized style and then with non-nasalized
style.
Exercise 36.5: Producing Nasalized and Non-nasalized Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
Speed
Languages may differ in the speed with which they are spoken. Some languages are
characterized by a slow, methodical style. This is called slow speech style. Other languages
tend to be spoken more quickly. This is called rapid speech style. The speed with which a
language is spoken can have a strong effect on other phonetic features as well, such as vowel
reduction and syllable timing.
Practice varying your speed by reading the following sentences, first with slow speech
style and then with rapid speech style.
392 Comprehensive Articulatory Phonetics
Exercise 36.6: Producing Slow and Rapid Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
Pitch Variation
The relative pitch patterns of a language, whether tonal or intonational, may vary in
the distance permitted between pitch levels. In some languages, the pitch may be restricted to
a narrow range of modulation while in others a broad range is permitted. These conditions
are called wide range style and narrow range style.
Another form of pitch modulation is monotone, in which little or no pitch variation
occurs at all throughout an entire phrase. This is called monotone style. Truly monotone
speech is actually quite rare, however.
In the following exercise, practice using each of the speech style described above.
Repeat each sentences after the recording.
Exercise 36.7: Producing Wide Range, Narrow Range, and Monotone Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
Volume
How loudly or softly a person speaks can also affect the sound of a language as a
whole. Some languages will always be spoken relatively quietly while others may sound
more loud than normal. This is called soft speech style and loud speech style.
Differences in the volume of a language may be a characteristic of the language as a
whole, or can be affected by such factors as age, sex, or social status.
Correctly mimicking the natural volume of a language is very important. Speaking
loudly when a language should have soft speech style may make native listeners feel
threatened or uncomfortable. Likewise, in a language with loud speech style, quiet speech
may come across as an indication of weak character, or even seductive intent.
Lesson 36: Speech Styles 393
Practice controlling your volume by reading the following sentences first with loud
speech style and then with soft speech. Repeat each utterance after the recording.
Exercise 36.8: Producing Loud and Soft Style
1. Laugh while you can because it will be just as funny when you learn my language.
2. The more you mimic the more you learn.
3. Although it takes a while, you have to learn the style to make the native smile.
