reached; the evidence is considered as the beginning of the change.’) (30).
Consider the following:
(23)	 Am Donnerstag wird das Schiff an der Mir-Station ankoppeln.
Dort wird Flade fünf Tage lang wissenschaftliche Experimente
vornehmen. (Diewald 2005: 31)
	 ‘On Thursday the ship will dock with the Space Station Mir.
For five days Flade (a German astronaut) will conduct scientific
experiments.’
Diewald argues that here, the writer has evidence (in this case, specific
knowledge) that a series of events will unfold in the future. In contrast to
the future meaning which can be indicated by present tense, the werden +
Infinitive construction adds the speaker’s perspective on the unfolding of
events and indicates the speaker has evidence for asserting that a series of
events will unfold in a certain way (Diewald 2005: 31). Smirnova (2006)
has made similar arguments concerning the würde + Infinitive construc-
tion, which also serves as a marker of inferential evidentiality.
1.1.2.4  Adverbs
Finally, there are numerous adverbs in English and German that can indi-
cate evidential meaning: supposedly, allegedly, apparently, certainly, surely,
clearly, etc. for English; angeblich, vermutlich, vorgeblich, offensichtlich,
scheinbar, anscheinend, sicherlich, etc. for German. Depending on adverb
and context, hearsay, inference, or direct perception may be involved. In
(24), inference from perception is the source of evidence, whereas in (25),
hearsay is what drives the speaker to make the assertion:
(24a)	 Ich habe Karen noch nicht gesehen. Offensichtlich kommt sie
nicht zur Party.
(24b)	I haven’t seen Karen yet. Evidently she’s not coming to the
party.
(25a)	 IchhabegerademitHeikegesprochen.AnscheinendkommtKaren
nicht zur Party.

(25b)	 I just spoke with Heike. Apparently Karen is not coming to the
party.
See Chafe (1986), Nuyts (1993), or Downing (2001) for more in-depth
discussions of evidential adverbs.
1.2  Perception Verbs
Although none of the above phenomena have involved perception verbs,
the role of perception in the acquisition of evidence is undeniable. Indeed,
all evidence is acquired in one way or another via perception. Semioticians
have long recognized the primacy of human perception in our conceptuali-
zation of reality (see, for example, Anttila 1980, Eco 2002, Chernigovskaya
2004, or Tiercelin 2005 for semiotic perspectives on human perception),
and although this study is not a study on the semiotics of human percep-
tion, I believe that semioticians’ close attention to perception illustrates the
need to pay more attention to the linguistics of perception. And there has
yet to be a full-fledged study of the role of perception verbs in signifying
evidentialmeaning.Butbeforedelvingintotheevidentialusesofperception
verbs, a general overview of these verbs and their typology is in order.
1.2.1  The Five Sensory Modalities and the Verbs Examined in this Study
Since the perception verbs of English and German and their expressions of
evidential meaning are the focus of this study, I have taken a sampling of
themostprevalentverbsfromeachofthefivesensorymodalities.Forvisual
perception, I will focus on see and look in English, sehen and aussehen in
German. Englishhear andsound, along with Germanhören, (sich) anhören,
and klingen, are representatives of auditory perception. Feel in English
and the German fühlen are used in the discussion of tactile perception,
20	 Chapter 1
while English smell and German riechen cover for olfactory perception.
Finally, English taste is discussed alongside German schmecken for gusta-
tory perception.
1.2.2  The Perception Verb Hierarchy
Not all five sensory modalities enjoy equal status in linguistic representa-
tion.Somemodalitiesenjoygreaterprominencenotonlyintheirfrequency
of usage, but also in their ability to express polysemous meanings related
to other sense modalities. After an exhaustive cross-linguistic study of
perception verbs, Viberg (1983: 136) developed the following hierarchy of
sense modalities:
Sight > Hearing > Touch > { Smell, Taste
Vibergexplains,‘averbhavingabasicmeaningbelongingtoasensemodality
higher(totheleft)inthehierarchycangetanextendedmeaningthatcovers
some (or all) of the sense modalities lower in the hierarchy’ (136–7). Thus
we can expect verbs expressing visual perception to exhibit more polysemy
and/or degree of generalization than verbs of taste. The reverse, however,
does not hold. And this is exactly what the data reveal. As we will see in
subsequent chapters, not only are there more attestations of verbs at the
top of the hierarchy, but there is also a greater degree of polysemy related
to evidential meaning(s) associated with these verbs. This hierarchy may
explain why most of the attention paid to perception verbs is reserved for
those verbs signifying vision (cf. Sweetser 1990: 23–48; Schröder 1995;
Harm 2000; van der Does and van Lambalgen 2000; de Haan forthcom-
ing). But seeing that vision is our primary – and most reliable – means of
perceiving the world (whereas a modality such as smell is non-primary and
less reliable), it should come as no surprise that the verbs of visual percep-
tion enjoy a place at the top of the hierarchy.
There are also a few perception verbs in English and German that are
nonspecificwithrespecttosensorymodality:notice,observe,merken‘notice,
perceive’, bemerken ‘observe, perceive’, and of course, perceive/wahrnehmen
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 21
(Harm 2000: 203–6). Although these verbs can be used evidentially (e.g.
I perceive that …), they fall outside the scope of this study.
1.2.3  A Typology of Perception Verbs
It is useful to draw a two-way distinction among perception verbs, namely
between subject-oriented and object-oriented perception verbs. Such a
distinction has been made by Viberg (1983) as well as Harm (2000), and
it will assist us here because we find certain evidential meanings (as well as
complementation patterns) evinced by subject-oriented perception verbs
and others by the object-oriented perception verbs.
Subject-oriented perception verbs (‘experiencer-based’ in Viberg 1983)
areverbsthatdescribetheperceptiveactonthepartoftheagent.Grammati-
cally, they are transitive verbs and feature the perceiver as the grammatical
subject of the clause. These verbs can be further subcategorized into experi-
encer perception verbs and agentive perception verbs. The latter describes
an intended act of perception, whereas the former focus more on the act
of perception itself without any special reference to the subject’s intent.
Cases of agentive perception can be seen in (26) and (27) below:
(26a)	 Karen listened to the music.
(26b)	 Karen hat die Musik angehört.
(27a)	 Karen smelled the iris with delight.
(27b)	 Karen hat die Iris mit Vergnügen gerochen.
Here, the subject of the sentence (Karen) takes an active role in the percep-
tion; she intently listens to the music and smells the iris in the garden. But
in (28) and (29), the case is slightly different:
(28a)	 Karen heard the music.
(28b)	 Karen hat die Musik gehört.
(29a)	 Karen tasted the garlic in the soup.
(29b)	 Karen hat den Knoblauch in der Suppe geschmeckt.
22	 Chapter 1
Whereas Karen intended to listen in (26) and smell in (27), she has no such
intent here. Instead, she could just happen to hear music playing in (28)
and taste the garlic in her soup in (29). The focus is not on her intent, but
rather on the de facto perception (an experience, rather than a volitional
act, of perception).
Subject-oriented perception verbs include see (experiencer), look (at)
(agentive), hear (experiencer), listen (to) (agentive), feel (experiencer or
agentive),smell(experienceroragentive),andtaste(experienceroragentive)
inEnglish, sehen‘see’(experiencer), ansehen‘lookat’(agentive), hören‘hear’
(experiencer), anhören‘listento’(agentive), fühlen(experiencer), tasten‘feel’
(agentive), riechen ‘smell’ (experiencer or agentive), and schmecken ‘taste’
(experiencer or agentive) in German. Agentive perception verbs rarely,
if ever, attest evidential readings because they focus on the agent’s active
involvement in perception and not on the experience of perception, the
latter being the way in which evidence is acquired. One’s intent to perceive
does not and cannot provide evidence; it is the experience of perception
itself which is able to provide any evidence which may exist.
Object-oriented perception verbs (‘source-based’ in Viberg 1983) fea-
ture the perceived object as the sentential subject, and the perceiver is
sometimes wholly absent from the clause. These verbs are intransitive,
and it is the perceptual stimulus, rather than the perceiver, that serves
as the grammatical subject of the clause. Here, an attribute perceived or
bestowed by the speaker is what is in focus. When the attribute is one that
is perceived and not bestowed, evidential meaning is present. (30) and (31)
feature object-oriented perception verbs:
(30a)	 Karen looks healthy.
(30b)	 Karen sieht gesund aus.
(31a)	 The cake tastes good.
(31b)	 Der Kuchen schmeckt gut.
Neither Karen nor the cake are the perceivers here; rather, the speaker is the
perceiver and reports on what s/he perceives. In (30), the speaker concludes
by Karen’s external appearance that Karen is healthy (visual evidentiality).
In (31), the cake’s taste is deemed by the speaker to be good. Should the
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 23
speaker not be the perceiver, a prepositional to-phrase in English or a dative
object in German can sometimes be used:
(32a)	 The cake tastes good to the baker.
(32b)	 Der Kuchen schmeckt dem Bäcker gut.
Similarly,speakersmaywishtonotethattheassessmentisindeedtheirsand
therefore insert to me or mir in place of some external perceiver. Object-
oriented perception verbs include look, sound, feel, taste, and smell in Eng-
lish, aussehen ‘look, appear’, (sich) anhören ‘sound’, (sich) anfühlen ‘feel’,
schmecken ‘taste’, and riechen ‘smell’ in German. Obviously, some verbs in
English function both as subject-oriented and object-oriented perception
verbs, while German occasionally employs the prefixing of an- and aus- to
make this distinction.
As we will see shortly, this two-way distinction plays into when and
how evidential meaning can be expressed. Subject-oriented perception
verbs take different complementation patterns than object-oriented per-
ception verbs, and the types of evidentiality expressed in these construc-
tions vary as well.
1.2.4  Polysemy
When discussing the semantics of perception verbs, one cannot avoid the
inevitable issue of polysemy. One need only take a brief look at entries of
various perception verbs in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) or the
Deutsches Wörterbuch (DWB) to see how myriad the meanings of certain
verbs can be, especially regarding visual perception. It goes without saying
that the root meaning of perception verbs is physical in nature; but as we
will see, shades of non-physical (i.e. internal) perception are often present
24	 Chapter 1
as well (cf. Sweetser 1990: 23–48; Harm 2000). I would like to briefly
outline this polysemy below.6
At the heart of verbs denoting visual perception such as see, look, or
the German sehen, is an act of physical perception with the eyes. But as
both Sweetser (1990: 32–4) and Harm (2000: 127–61) make clear, verbs of
physical perception can often point to internal states of knowledge or intel-
lection. This meaning is salient in expressions such as I see what you mean
or Ich sehe, was du meinst, where one is hard-pressed to pinpoint exactly
what is physically perceived. Rather, the act is internal: one understands
what the speech partner is attempting to convey. In a similar vein, verbs of
physical perception can also signify what Sweetser calls ‘mental “vision”’
(33), i.e. the focusing of mental attention on an object or state of affairs.
Consider verbs such as look forward to or vorausschauen ‘foresee’: noth-
ing is being physically perceived here; instead, the concern is on mental
attention being focused on some future event. But given the strong affinity
between vision and knowledge (after all, the Latin videre ‘see’ is cognate
with English wise and German wissen ‘know’), such polysemy should come
as no surprise.7
Verbs of auditory perception exhibit some degree of metonymic
polysemy, namely in that these verbs of hearing can also denote the process-
ing of the content or the meaning of what is heard, rather than focusing
on the act of hearing itself. This is especially prevalent in cases of hearsay
evidentiality:
(33a)	 I heard that Karen isn’t coming to the party.
(33b)	 Ich hörte, dass Karen nicht zur Party kommt.
6	 My discussion of the polysemy found among the English and German perception
verbs is far from exhaustive. For more in-depth discussions of polysemy, as well as
historicalsemantics,readersarereferredtoSweetser(1990:23–48)andHarm(2000).
Relevant entries in the OED or DWB also provide exhaustive overviews of polysemy.
Readers interested in common Germanic should consult Kluge (2002), while those
keen on Indo-European roots are referred to Pokorny (2005).
7	 The metaphorical nature of this polysemy is discussed in Section 1.4.1.
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 25
As we see, the focus here is on the assertion that Karen is not coming to
the party. But even so, for this information to have been acquired, an act
of auditory perception was necessary, so the root meaning of ‘to hear’ is far
from absent. A bit more abstract are the cases where the sense of obedience
becomes associated with auditory perception. Consider the German Hör
auf deine Mutter! or the English Listen to your mother! This connection is
due no doubt to the fact that for someone to ‘take orders’ from someone
else, an act of auditory perception is necessary to know what is expected.
We now come to tactile perception, which oftentimes can denote not
only external perception, but also internal perception (emotional or intui-
tive). The verbs feel in English and fühlen in German enjoy such status. In
addition, Harm (2000: 194–202) notes that verbs of tactile perception
can, along with the verbs of visual perception, come to signify understand-
ing. This is evident in the German begreifen ‘comprehend, understand’
(<Middle High German grîfan ‘feel, touch’; cf. English grasp), as it is in
the English colloquial expression I feel you ‘I understand and empathize
with what you mean’.
Verbs of olfactory and gustatory perception don’t evince the regular
patterns of polysemy that other sensory modalities do. They do give rise
to some polysemy, however. This is often the case when the same verb
can function as both a subject-oriented and an object-oriented percep-
tion verb. When smell functions as a subject-oriented verb, for example,
it denotes the act of olfactory perception. But when serving as an object-
oriented perception verb, smell describes an omission of odors, rather than
an act of physical perception (e.g. I smelled the roses vs. The roses smelled
of decay). Sometimes verbs signifying gustatory perception can also mean
(or are derived from a sense of ) ‘try’ or ‘choose’. Consider the German
kosten ‘taste, try’, which involves a sense of gustatory perception as well as
sampling the food in question.
So what does this mean for evidentiality? The polysemy found among
the perception verbs can indeed transfer over into the evidential domain,
in that a related set of evidential meanings can be expressed by a single
perception verb. This will be part of the focus of the next section, where
I define an evidential perception verb, and then attempt to develop a
26	 Chapter 1
typology of evidential perception verbs in English and German based on
complementation patterns.
1.3  Evidential Perception Verbs
1.3.1  Defining Evidential Perception Verbs
Now that we have had an overview of evidentiality and of perception
verbs, it is possible to establish a working definition of evidential percep-
tion verbs. That evidentiality is deictic by nature was already recognized
by Jakobson (1971 [1957]); so any evidential use of perception verbs must
contain a deictic meaning in addition to the regular perceptive meaning.
This is best illustrated by (34) and (35):
(34a)	 I see the house.
(34b)	 Ich sehe das Haus.
(35a)	 I see the house burning.
(35b)	 Ich sehe das Haus brennen.
In (34), the only thing being indicated by the speaker is the experience of
visually perceiving a house. But in (35), there are two propositions instead
of one: one, the house is burning, and two, the speaker sees the house
burning. This second proposition – the indication by the speaker that s/he
has visual evidence for reporting that the house is burning – contains the
additional deictic component because it points to the speaker’s evidence
and does not solely indicate an act of perception. The perceptive evidence
always lies with the speaker, even when there is an object-oriented percep-
tion verb involved:
(36a)	 Karen looks sick.
(36b)	 Karen sieht krank aus.
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 27
The speaker may be absent in the syntactic structure, and there are not
two propositions here, but there are still two layers of meaning: Karen’s
visual appearance (the evidence), and the speaker’s inference based on
this appearance. Sentences (34) through (36) should also make clear that
subject-oriented perception verbs can only be evidential with a first-person
subject,whereastheobject-orientedperceptionverbsallowevidentialread-
ings with second- and third-person grammatical subjects.
1.3.2  Toward a Typology of Evidential Perception Verbs
Perception verbs can be employed in a variety of ways to signal evidential
meaning, and this is done primarily through a variety of complementation
patterns. Although there has been quite a bit of scholarship concerning the
complementation patterns of perception verbs (see, for example, Rogers
1971,1972;Vliegen1988;vonderMeer1994;Schröder1995;Poch&Verda-
guer 1997; Girard 1998; Felser 1999; van Gelderen 2004: 179–99), much
less attention has been given to evidential meaning. Those that have paid
attentiontoevidentialmeaning,e.g.Gisborne(1998),vanGelderen(2004:
179–99), and Gisborne & Holmes (2007), have limited their attention to
only certain perception verbs, and an overall typology has therefore not
been developed. None of this work has been comparative in nature, andthe
focushasbeenmainlysynchronic.Basedonextensivecorpus-basedresearch
of all five perceptual modalities, I have established a typology of evidential
perception verbs in English and German. There are a total of seven com-
plementation patterns, as well as two other construction types.
Type I: Perception Verb (PV) + Finite Complement Clause (FCC)
<PV + FCC>
This is the most common complementation pattern found among percep-
tionverbsinEnglishandGerman.Thecomplementizer(thatinEnglish,dass
in German) is not always present, however. Here are some examples:
28	 Chapter 1
(37)	 I now see plainly that Men cannot arrive at a full Satisfaction
by Riches, nor at Power by enjoying Principalities or Kingdoms,
nor at Esteem and Reverence by the Accession of Dignities, nor at
Nobility by Glory, nor at true Joy by carnal Pleasures. (Helsinki
Corpus:CEBOETH3,RichardPreston(trans.), Boethius (1695),
p. 124)
(38)	 Now I hear you were with the old man later on last night.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1960vidl.d8a, Gore Vidal, The Best Man,
In Best American Plays, 5th series 1957–1963, ed. John Gassner,
New York: Crown Publishers, 1963)
(39)	 Do es nue liecht ward, do sach wir, daz dy. herren zu einander
giengen in ain haws. (Bonner Corpus: Text 113, Helene Kot-
tanerin, Denkwürdigkeiten (1445–1452), S. 23)
	 ‘When it now became light, then we saw that the lords went to
one another in a house.’8
(40)	Auch vom Ausland drohen unserer Industrie Gefahren. Wir sehen
mehr und mehr, daß Länder, die bisher unsere Abnehmer waren,
selbst zur Produktion übergehen. (DWDS Corpus: ‘Deutscher
Reichstag’, in: Vossische Zeitung (Morgen-Ausgabe) (4.3.1908),
S. 15)
	 ‘Even from abroad dangers are threatening our industry. We
see more and more that even countries that were until now our
customers are transitioning to production.’
There is one particular construction exclusive to English, whereby the
present participle of the verb see (seeing) takes a complement clause but
behaves more like a conjunction than a pure verb:
(41)	 Seeing then thou knowest already which is the true Happiness, and
which the false one, it remains thou shouldst be informed from what

(42)	I never grudged money to her – how could I, seeing that more
than I can waste is given to me for nothing? (ARCHER Corpus:
1887shaw.f6b, George Bernard Shaw, An Unsocial Socialist)
In(41)and(42),seeingbehaveslikeacausalconjunctionbecauseitindicates
the grounds the speaker has for making an assertion about something else
in the apodosis. It is still evidential, however, for the speaker signifies via
seeing not only that the proposition is the reason for something else, but
that s/he has evidence for this assertion. Here, the evidence appears to be
the speaker’s direct experience and/or knowledge (based on the Seeing
is Knowing metaphor; see Section 1.2.4). This construction will be dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 2. This complementation pattern is taken
almost exclusively by the subject-oriented perception verbs.
Type II: PV + WH-Complement Clause (WH-CC)9
<PV + WH-CC>
Occurring far less frequently than, yet closely related to, the <PV + FCC>
construction is the pattern where one finds a wh-word rather than the that/
dass complementizer:
(43)	 We were there at ye time of ye fair & so saw what there chief mer-
chandise consisted of – namely, flax, hemp, sheep, horses, mules, &
such like, & pistols also which are there made & sold in great quan-
tities, it being a place for that sort of work ye most remarquable in
France.(ARCHERCorpus:1687ferr.j2b,RichardFerrier, Journal
of Major Richard Ferrier, Camden Society Publications)
(44)	nur fühlte ich, was ich schon oft bemerkt habe, auf das lebhafteste:
Leute von einigem Stande werden sich immer in kalter Entfernung
vom gemeinen Volke halten, als glaubten sie durch Annäherung
9	 I would like to thank Maurice Vliegen for drawing this complementation pattern
to my attention.
30	 Chapter 1
zu verlieren … (Goethe Corpus: Die Leiden des jungen Werther
(1774), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 6, S. 10)
	 ‘I just felt what I already often noted in the most lively way:
people of a certain standing will always keep themselves at a
cold distance from the common people, as if they believed they
would lose by approaching others.’
Thepresenceofawh-wordintheseconstructionstendtomaketheproposi-
tions less informative than if athat/dasscomplementizer were present; after
all, part of the proposition’s content is contained in thewh-word word. So
in (43), for example, we find out what the merchandise consisted of not
in the clause itself, but only later in the discourse (this is not always the
case with <PV + WH-CC> constructions). As with the <PV + FCC>
pattern, only subject-oriented perception verbs occur here.
Type III: PV + Direct Object (DO) + Non-Finite Verb (NFV)
<PV + DO + NFV>
Here, the perception verb takes a direct object and a non-finite verb –
either an infinitive, present participle (in English),10 or past participle – as
its complements:11
(45)	But a strange conceited, vain man he is, that ever I met withal,
in his own praise – as I have heretofore observed of him. Thence
home, and upon Tower hill saw about 3 or 400 seamen get together
10	 It must be made clear that the present participle in German only functions adjecti-
vally or adverbially, but not verbally as its English counterpart, as in (46). Hence the
grammaticality of in den kommenden Tagen ‘in the coming days’ but not of *Ich sehe
sie kommend (lit. ‘I see her coming’). Consequently, present participles will only be
discussed with regard to the English data.
11	 I do not mean to suggest there are no semantic differences between the infinitive,
present participle, and past participle complements (i.e. the nature of the evidence
provided); each of these three non-finite verbal forms merely forms a subtype of the
overarching <PV + DO + NFV> pattern.
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 31
… (Helsinki Corpus: CEDIAR3A, Samuel Pepys, The Diary of
Samuel Pepys (1666–1667), P VII, 415)
(46)	And Iohn bare record saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
heaven, like a Doue, and it abode vpon him. (Helsinki Corpus:
CNTEST2, The New Testament (1611), I, 20)
(47)	Ich fühle mich nun mit neuen Kräften gestärkt, der Wahrheit
nachzuforschen, nachdem ich die Versichrung des großen Mannes
für mich habe, daß meine erste Bestrebungen nicht ganz fruchtlos
gewesen. (Kant Corpus: AA XI, Briefwechsel 1789, S. 68–9)
	 ‘I feel myself strengthened with new powers to research the truth
after having the assurance of the great man that my first attempt
had not been fruitless.’
When an infinitive or present participle is used, the focus is on the action
at hand, although the English present participle contributes a progressive
aspectual flavoring, while the infinitive signals perfectivity. But when a past
participle is used (as in (47)), the focus is more on a present state result-
ing from a previous action (resultative meaning). And the speaker’s role
in this action was passive, i.e. the speaker was the patient, not the agent,
of whatever action has been done. This complementation pattern can be
found only with subject-oriented perception verbs.
Type IV: PV + Prepositional Phrase (PP)
<PV + PP>
Aperceptionverbcanalsobe usedevidentiallywhen coupled withaprepo-
sitional phrase:
(48)	Oder wenn der Sohn, als der Vater das Zusammensein mit der
blühenden Schwiegertochter etwas allzu begeistert schildert, dem
Alten zuruft: ‘Du –! Das riecht nach Inzest!’ – Nun ja, dies ist
eben ein Theaterskandal in Paris, und der Himmel weiß, daß wir
an andere gewöhnt sind. (DWDS Corpus: Paul Block, ‘Das Grab
unter dem Triumphbogen’, in: Berliner Tageblatt (Morgen-Aus-
gabe) (11.3.1924), S. 2–3)
32	 Chapter 1
	 ‘Oriftheson,whenthefathersomewhatalltoosurpriseddepicts
the encounter with his blossoming daughter-in-law, calls out
to his father: “You! That smells like incest!” Well, this is just a
theater scandal in Paris, and heaven knows that we’re used to
others like this.’
Literal perception is not involved here at all. Rather, the speaker uses the
perception verb metaphorically to indicate that s/he senses or infers that
something exists. A paraphrase here could be That appears to be incest or
Das scheint Inzest zu sein. Of course, the <PV + PP> construction need
not denote evidentiality (consider That soup smells like motor oil), but if
evidentialmeaningisexpressed,inferenceismostoftenthetypeofevidence
conveyed. The <PV + PP> complementation pattern is found only among
object-oriented perception verbs.12
Type V: PV + Adjective (ADJ)
<PV + ADJ>
This is another complementation pattern that need not be evidential,
but when it does specify speaker evidence, inference is involved. And this
inference is based on whatever sensory modality is expressed by the verb:
(49)	She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty
features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the
fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the
animation of eye which it had also produced.(ARCHER Corpus:
1818aust.f5b, Jane Austen, Persuasion, In The Complete Novels of
Jane Austen)
12	 There is usually only one preposition that can be coupled with any particular percep-
tion verb in such constructions. The particular preposition involved will be indicated
in subscript, so, e.g., in the discussion of the perception verb look where only the
preposition like is used (Section 2.3.2), the notation will be <PV + PPlike>.
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 33
(50)	 Mutter Aurelie schlug mich immer auf die Finger, wenn ich nach
der Karavine griff, der Vater sah so bös aus, ich dachte, er würde
mich schlagen. (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre
(1795–1796), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 7, S. 604)
	 ‘Mother Aurelie always wrapped my knuckles if I reached for
the Karvine, the Father looked so angry I thought he would hit
me.’
Here, the speaker infers from visual perception that something is the case.
In (49), the speaker judges from the woman’s physical appearance that
she is doing well. And in (50), the speaker judges that the Father is angry
based on physical appearance. Whether the girl in (49) or the Father in
(50) really are well or angry is another question; but they appear to be thus,
and this is the evidential meaning that is expressed. But like construction
type IV, this complementation pattern need not always carry evidential
meaning. It is possible for the adjective to be solely the speaker’s value
judgment, rather than an inference about a possible state of affairs. She
looks well, for example, can also mean that the speaker views the female’s
appearance positively. Rather than using visual evidence to make a claim,
the speaker merely expresses a value judgment on the physical attributes
of the female in question (of course, the bestowed attributes are based on
visual appearance). Only object-oriented perception verbs appear with the
<PV + ADJ> complementation pattern.13
Type VI: PV + Conjunction (CONJ) + Clause (C)

uncommon to find irrealis semantics in the subordinated clause:

Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 35
This complementation pattern allows for speakers to indicate that they
have evidence for a possible or hypothetical state of affairs. The evidence
usually does not point to what is, but to what might or could be. So in (54),
for example, the speaker – or, more precisely, the writer – takes as evidence
the premise that the documents in question presumably are forgeries, and
employs the perception verb klingen ‘sound’ to indicate that this premise
provides evidence for arriving at the subsequent conclusion that someone
made a hasty judgment about the authenticity of seventy documents. As
with most other complementation patterns, object-oriented perception
verbs are preferred in this pattern as well.
Type VII: PV + (Infinitive Copula (IC)) + ADJ or Noun (N) or ADJ + N
<PV + {IC + ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}>
This complementation pattern is limited to English, and there is variabil-
ity as to whether an adjective, a noun, or an adjective + noun follows the
copula verb:
(55)	 TheCaptainondeckandinajollymoodpointedouttousaniceberg
in the distance. It looked, through the glass, to be about 30 feet long
and 50 or 60 feet high. (ARCHER Corpus: 1850low.j6a, Garrett

(56)	 It looked to be public offices … (ARCHER Corpus: 1917firb.f7b,
Ronald Firbank, Caprice, In Three Novels, Norfolk, CT: New
Directions)
If there is only an adjectival complement as in (55), then the infinitive
copula is obligatory, ergo differentiating the construction from Type IV.
But if there is either a noun or an adjective plus noun, the copula is only
optional and can be elided from the construction:
(57)	 Peter looks a nice man. (Gisborne & Holmes 2007: 6)

	 ‘Peter appears to be a nice man’
Here however, the copula sein appears after the adjective + noun, but that
is simply due to German’s propensity to place non-finite verbs at the end
of clauses. Were this constructional pattern to appear with a perception
verb, it would be ungrammatical:
(59)	 *Peter klingt ein netter Mann zu sein.
	 ‘Peter sounds to be a nice man.’
Only object-oriented perception verbs can take this complementation
pattern.

Unliketheprevioussevencomplementationpatternsexhibitedbyevidential
perception verbs, parenthetical evidentials do not take any complemen-
tation pattern. Rather, they are superimposed on the syntactic structure
of the clause in which they appear and are thus not part of the sentence
proper. They are occasionally set off by punctuation and provide more of
a background to the sentence, rather than making the evidential meaning
the prime focus:

	 ‘Löbell repeats; I stick to what’s in this memo and refute most
emphatically the outrageous allegation which you made (to Erz-

most decisively.’
When a verb denoting auditory perception is used as a parenthetical, as it is
in (60), hearsay evidentiality is almost guaranteed. With other perception
verbs, meanings tend to be more abstract, metaphorical expressions of per-
ceptualevidentiality.Bothsubject-andobject-orientedperceptionverbscan
appear in parenthetical constructions, although in the corpora examined
for this study, only subject-oriented perception verbs were found.
Type IX: Perception Verb External to the Clause
<EXT>
The final use of evidential perception verbs we will examine is, like the
parentheticals, absent from the clause proper of the reported state or event.
But unlike parentheticals, the <EXT> evidentials are totally removed
from the clauses taken in their scope (the ‘evidentialized’ clauses). There
is often a pronoun that refers not to a singular entity, but to the entire
content of a portion of discourse, and it is the direct object of the percep-
tion verb. The <EXT> construction can work either anaphorically or
cataphorically:
(62)	 That night late his body was found in a ditch, about a mile out
of town, near St. Pancras church. His sword was thrust through
him, but no blood was on his clothes or about him. His shoes were
clean, his money was in his pocket: but nothing was about his neck,
and a mark was all round it, an inch broad, which shewed he was
38	 Chapter 1
strangled. His breast was likewise all over marked with bruises,
and his neck was broken. All this I saw; for Lloyd and I went to
view his body. (Helsinki Corpus: CEHIST3A, Gilbert Burnet,

II) (1640–1710), 1, II, p. 164)

I, Gedanken von der wahren Schätzung der lebendigen Kräfte und
Beurtheilung der Beweise … (1747), S. 071)
	 ‘From this we see: since the body is therefore not simply inelastic
in nature because its parts are pushed in, but rather only because
they don’t restore themselves with the same force with which
they were pushed in.’
In both (62) and (63), the writers point to some other part of the text or
discourse and indicate they have evidence for the information indicated.
In (62), the relationship is anaphoric, whereas it is cataphoric in (63). Such
evidentiality is the sole domain of subject-oriented perception verbs.
As we look at specific verbs in the following chapters, we will come
across several cases where evidential meaning may be ambiguous, or where
certain evidential constructions don’t fit perfectly into any of the nine
types of complementation patterns listed above. These will be addressed on
a case-by-case basis. We will also come across other phenomena – namely,
negation and the presence of modal verbs – that can make fleshing out
evidential meaning a bit more complicated than the clear-cut examples
above. These too will be addressed as they pertain to the discussion at
hand. The typology laid out here is a generalization that works quite
well in most cases, but it is not intended to be a comprehensive listing
of all possible construction types in which evidential perception verbs
can appear.
To conclude, the nine most prominent complementation patterns/
construction types evinced by evidential perception verbs are:

1.4  Other Issues
Before moving on to an in-depth examination of each sensory modality, I
wishtodiscussa fewmoreissuesthatarepertinentto theinterplaybetween
evidentiality and perception verbs. Metaphor, subjectivity and subjectifica-
tion, intersubjectivity, stance and engagement, and bleaching can all play
an important role in certain cases where perception verbs convey evidential
meaning. In addition, the workings of grammaticalization occasionally
manifest themselves, namely in the use of seeing as a conjunction. Finally,
I will give some attention to the role of text type/genre in the use of evi-
dential perception verbs.
40	 Chapter 1
1.4.1  Metaphor
As we already saw in Section 1.2.4, conceptual metaphor plays a major
role in the polysemy found among the perception verbs, and this polysemy
also exists when the perception verbs are used to signal evidential mean-
ing. This is perhaps most obvious in uses of the verb see/sehen to indicate
knowledge or understanding on the part of the speaker, rather than visual
perception (see Sweetser 1990: 32–4 and Lakoff & Johnson 2003 [1980]:
48). However, the Seeing is Knowing and Seeing is Understand-
ing metaphors do more than explain the polysemy of vision; indeed, they
reveal that we actually conceptualize knowledge itself through visual per-
ception. As Sweetser puts it, we conceive of knowledge and understanding
as ‘mental “vision”’ (33). In terms of evidentiality, such uses of see indicate
that the speaker draws on his or her understanding or knowledge as evi-
dence for an assertion:
(64)	Naytruly,Iseealreadyallisnaught,butyetIwillobiectthosethings
which haue caried me awrie. (Helsinki Corpus: CEHAND2A,
George Gifford, A Handbook on Witches and Witchcraft (1593),
p. E3V)
One can obviously not visually perceive that ‘all is naught’, but one may
certainly know or understand this to be the case. So in (64), see does not
indicate that visual perception is the evidence for declaring that there is no
hope; rather, the speaker indicates he knows that ‘all is naught’. Of course,
visual perception still plays a role here: since vision is our primary way of
acquiring information, one cannot help but suppose that the conclusion
arrived at in (64) is because of what was witnessed or seen. And this previ-
ous act of perception now forms the basis of knowledge and understand-
ing. Vision is not the only modality where metaphors of perception can
be found, but (64) illustrates the way metaphors of perception transfer
seamlessly into the evidential domain.
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 41
1.4.2  Subjectivity and Subjectification
Subjectivity, broadly defined as the presence of the speaker in the content
of the discourse, is another semantic/pragmatic phenomenon germane to
evidential perception verbs. Subjectification refers to the increasing pres-
ence of the speaker in the discourse. Two competing theories – those of
Traugott and Langacker – currently enjoy prominence in discussions of
subjectification (see, for example, essays in Stein & Wright 1995), and both
bear relevance in the discussion here.
For Traugott, subjectification is diachronic in nature, insofar as it
pertains to increasing speaker presence being signified by a single linguis-
tic item over time. In Traugott (1982), the general cline of propositional
> (textual>) expressive was postulated, which was further elaborated by
Traugott (1989: 34–5) and Traugott & Dasher (2002: 94–5) as three gen-
eral tendencies of semantic change (viewed as increased subjectification):
the first tendency is for meanings that describe external situations to begin
describing internal (i.e., cognitive, evaluative, or perceptual) situations. In
Old English, for example, the perception verb felan only meant ‘to touch’
anditfirstacquireditsinternalsenseof‘experiencementally’inthelateOld
English period. Next, meanings that describe internal or external situations
are employed to describe things in the metalinguistic or textual arena. In
the 1500s, observe merely meant ‘to perceive (that)’, but by the 1600s it had
acquired a new meaning: ‘to state that’, a speech-act verb that encodes a
metalinguistic situation. Finally, meanings can increasingly become based
on the speaker’s subjective attitude or belief regarding the proposition. The
epistemic use of the modal verbs – as in (14) – falls into this category. The
result of this third tendency is full-blown subjectivity.
Langacker (1990) has postulated a more synchronic, sentence-based
view of subjectivity. Unlike Traugott, where subjectification is the result
of semantic shifts, Langacker considers a sentence to be maximally subjec-
tive when the speech event and its participants are left unexpressed; more
objective sentences place the event in question ‘on stage’ as the focus of
attention. To use Langacker’s examples (1990: 17–20):
42	 Chapter 1
(65a)	 Vanessa jumped across the table.
(65b)	 Vanessa is sitting across the table from Veronica.
(65c)	 Vanessa is sitting across the table from me.
(65d)	 Vanessa is sitting across the table.
According to Langacker, (65a) is maximally objective because an event is
reported without regard to the location of the speaker or the hearer. Exam-
ples (65b,c) are more subjective because they feature some sort of reference
pointselectedbythespeaker:Veronicain(65b)andthespeakerhim/herself
in (65c). In (65d), maximal subjectivity occurs because the reference point
is the speaker him/herself (the ground); but unlike in (65c), this is taken
for granted and not even mentioned. Objective scenarios are viewed as ‘on-
stage’ events that can be viewed by speakers and hearers, whereas subjec-
tive scenarios involve the speaker (and hearer) being involved themselves
in the construal and interpretation of the event: the semantic content of
the sentence is thus ‘off-stage’ because it is not ‘objectively’ being viewed,
i.e. the speaker is not totally absent – whether physically or conceptually
– from the state or event being described.
These views of subjectivity and subjectification shed light on various
aspects of evidential perception verbs. On the one hand, Traugott’s view of
subjectification helps explain why various perception verbs have acquired
internalized meanings, and therefore why certain expressions of eviden-
tiality are based more on speaker-internal rather than speaker-external
evidence. For example, in (66),fühlen is used to signify evidence not based
on tactile perception, but rather on internal feeling or intuition:
(66)	Wir fühlen uns verraten und verlassen. (DWDS Corpus: Birgit
Cerha, ‘Eine Stadt in Angst und Elend’, in: Die Zeit 17.10.1997,
S. 13)
	 ‘We feel betrayed and abandoned.’
One cannot externally (sensorily) detect betrayal nor abandonment, but
one can internally feel that these actions have been committed, and that
is the case here. When perception verbs signify inferential evidence, the
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 43
degree of subjectification is even greater because the speaker’s attitude
towards the proposition is being expressed:
(67)	Daraussehenwir,dassalleunsereVorstellungenmiteinemGefühle
begleitet seyn, indem sie affectionen von dem Zustande der Seele
sind. (Kant Corpus: AA XV, Reflexionen zur Anthropologie,
Seite 268)
	 ‘Hence we see that all our ideas are accompanied by one feeling
because they are affections of the state of the soul.’
Here, Kant draws his conclusion about the causes of ideas from previously
discussed evidence. The perception verb sehen indicates no mere act of
physical, visual perception (although this is metaphorically present), but
rather points to Kant’s subjective inference about a state of affairs.
From a Langackerian perspective, on the other hand, subjectivity
would focus more on the speaker’s unmentioned presence in the percep-
tual act, rather than on the speaker’s subjective attitude expressed via a
perception verb. This is perhaps best seen in object-oriented perception
verbs, regardless of the presence or absence of evidential meaning: the
perception itself could be considered off-stage because the speaker is the
perceiver and therefore maximally involved in the action, even though s/he
is not syntactically expressed:
(68)	It looks like the floor is dirty.
Here, the speaker is maximally involved in the perception and inference,
and there is therefore no ‘on-stage’ event being described. The object-
oriented perception verbs are supposedly even more subjective when they
are raised:
(69)	The floor looks like it’s dirty.
Langacker (1999) believes raising constructions exhibit a higher degree
of subjectification because the speaker becomes even less self-aware, and
the sentence is therefore taken to be even more subjective (cf. Nuyts 2001,
44	 Chapter 1
Verhagen2005).Amore‘objective’statementwouldeithermarkthespeaker
him/herself as the perceiver (The floor looks to me like it’s dirty) or indicate
a perceiver other than the speaker (The floor looks to Vanessa like it’s dirty).
Subject-oriented perception verbs are more objective than their object-
oriented counterparts because perceptive acts can be reported without
regard to the speaker (70a), and even when the speakers are the perceivers,
they must explicitly indicate their role in the perception via first-person
pronouns (70b):
(70a)	 Vanessa sees the dirty floor.
(70b)	I see the dirty floor.
1.4.3  Intersubjectivity
Closely tied-in with subjectivity is intersubjectivity, the notion that
although there is a high degree of speaker involvement in the reporting of
the proposition, there is also an implicit presence of a larger speech com-
munity, whether that be only the hearer or an unspecified number of other
people (Nuyts 2001; Traugott & Dasher 2002: 19–24, 89–99; Verhagen
2005). To return to (68) and (69), for example, (68) could be considered an
intersubjective assessment of the floor’s condition because the impersonal
sentencestructure–thepresenceofthegrammaticalsubject it–signalsthat
this condition is perceivable or has been perceived by people other than the
speaker, all of whom could make this evidential assessment (Nuyts 2001:
270, 307; Verhagen 2005: 133). In (69), on the other hand, this assessment
lies solely with the speaker.14 More broadly, how to determine whether evi-
dence is subjective or intersubjective is best explicated by Nuyts (2001: 34):
‘does the speaker suggest that (s)he alone knows the evidence and draws
14	 I find this analysis problematic, especially as it relates to perception verbs and the
purported availability of evidence to a larger speech community. Particular problems
with this approach will be discussed in later chapters as they relate to each individual
perception verb.
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 45
a conclusion from it; or does (s)he indicate that the evidence is known to
(or accessible by) a larger group of people who share the conclusion based
on it’. So in terms of evidential perception verbs, this plays itself out in
speakers/writers (hereafter SP/Ws) indicating that they are not in sole pos-
session of the evidence but rather share it with a larger speech community,
or at least are bringing it to their addressee’s attention. In addition, one
could argue – in line with what Langacker claims – that the presence of
me or mir in constructions such as (69) also point to intersubjectivity (less
subjectivity in Langacker’s terms), insofar as the speaker explicitly points
out the assessment is indeed his/hers, thereby acknowledging that other
assessments may well be possible.15 This sort of intersubjective negotiation
of evidence also occurs in parenthetical constructions, which allow the
SP/W to make the force of asserted evidence more tentative.
1.4.4  Stance and Engagement
Also related to the speaker-hearer or writer-reader relationship in intersub-
jectivity is the notion of ‘stance and engagement’ (Hyland 2005; cf. Biber
& Finegan 1989, Biber, Conrad, and Reppen 1998). The notion of stance
is the ‘attitudinal dimension’ (Hyland 2005: 176) brought to the discourse
by the speaker, as it provides a way for speakers and writers ‘to stamp their
personal authority onto their argument or step back and disguise their
involvement’ (176). Evidentiality is obviously part of stance, as it provides
the means of indicating evidence for an asserted proposition, thus making
the speaker’s relation to the discourse more clear. Engagement, on the other
hand, allows speakers and writers to relate this evidence to their audience
in the intersubjective domain; it allows speakers and writers to pull their
respective audiences ‘along with their arguments, focusing their attention,
15	 Nuyts (2001: 342), however, argues that the presence of me or mir is actually a marker
of increased subjectivity. I tend to agree more with Langacker that clauses contain-
ing these dative pronouns are indeed less subjective (more intersubjective), rather
than more subjective, as the SP/W admits overtly that the assessment is indeed his/
hers.
46	 Chapter 1
acknowledgingtheiruncertainties,includingthemasdiscourseparticipants,
and guiding them to interpretations’ (176). So when the evidence is first
brought to the addressee’s attention, the addressee’s analysis of available
evidence is guided in any way, the SP/W indicates that other analyses of
the evidence are possible, or at least indicates that this evidence is shared
with others, it is a case of intersubjective engagement. This often occurs
when subject-oriented perception verbs occur with a plural grammatical
subject (as in (66)), thereby indicating – at the least – that the SP/W is
not the only one is possession of the perceptual evidence. Parenthetical
constructions are also instances of intersubjective engagement, as they
allow the SP/Ws to comment explicitly on the evidence with the addressee
in mind, as is seen in (61) and (62).
1.4.5  Bleaching and Grammaticalization
Semantic bleaching, the fading away of a word’s semantic (i.e. lexical)
content, is often discussed in the context of grammaticalization (Sweetser
1988, Hopper & Traugott 2003: 94–8), but it is not limited to grammatical
phenomena (see examples in Traugott & Dasher 2002: 59). And although
thebleacheditemmayloselexicalcontent,itusuallygainspragmaticmean-
ing which it did not previously possess. This is perhaps most apparent in
the grammaticalized use of the English seeing as a conjunction:
(71)	 And ({yet{), if ({I{) had so ({done{) indeed, my lords, as master
Rich hath sworne, seing it was spoken but in Familiar secreate
talk, nothing affirminge, and only in puttinge of cases, without
other displeasaunt circumstances, it cannot iustly be taken to be
spoken maliciouslye; And where there is no malice, there can be no
offence. (Helsinki Corpus: CEBIO1, William Roper, The Lyfe of
Sir Thomas More (1500–1570), p. 89)
Here, the speaker is responding to allegations, which obviously cannot be
visually perceived. Instead, he employs seing not only to serve as a causal
conjunction (the grammaticalized, additional pragmatic meaning), but
Evidentiality and Perception Verbs: An Overview	 47
also to indicate that he has evidence for the proposition that falls within
its scope. But because of semantic bleaching, it is unclear exactly how this
evidence was acquired. At the least, it was not acquired primarily through
vision, although certain metaphorical extensions are possible. Given the
context, it appears that the speaker is pointing to common or undisputed
knowledge as the source of ‘it was spoken …’, i.e. the speaker is not the only
one who knows this and is drawing on this common ground as evidence for
his argument in the next clause (that nothing was spoken maliciously).16
1.4.6  Text Type/Genre
Whereas phenomena such as metaphor, (inter)subjectivity, subjectifica-
tion, stance, engagement, and bleaching help explain how, when, and why
the evidential uses of perception verbs can occur, text type and genre can
assist us in examining where one is likely to find these evidential perception
verbs. Whereas genre is the cover term used to apply external criteria such
as thematic content and textual function to the classification of texts, text
type is a term that highlights specific linguistic features such as the use of
subordination or hedges one might find associated with certain texts, i.e.
the focus is text-internal rather than text-external (Brinton & Traugott
2005: 156–9). So in what kind of genres or text types is one likely to find
evidential perception verbs most frequently? Given evidentiality’s deictic
nature, one would expect to find these evidential perception verbs in texts
16	 Mair (1994) has suggested that the infinitive to see may be undergoing grammati-
calization when coupled with the verb look (e.g. I will look to see what can be done.),
arguing that what is here is a main clause with look conjoined by a purpose clause
signaled by to see. Therefore, to see functions as a conjunction. However, Mair fails
to take into account the difference between subject- and object-oriented perception
verbs (which plays a role here), as he does with the metaphorically-driven polysemy
that one finds exhibited by the verb see (here, see appears to mean something along
the lines of ‘to examine,’ which is clearly lexical). Calling to see a conjunction seems a
bit premature when one compares its semantic and syntactic behavior with the causal
conjunction seeing discussed above, keeping metaphor, polysemy, and perception
verb typology in mind.
48	 Chapter 1
where the SP/W exhibits a major presence. Therefore, diaries, memoirs,
travel logs, transcripts of court proceedings, plays, etc. are likely to con-
tain more evidential uses of perception verbs than those genres where the
SP/W is a mere ‘objective’ reporter and virtually absent, e.g. in chronicles
or other types of historical accounts, laws, biographies, etc. I am unfor-
tunately unable to provide any quantitative data concerning text type/
genre in this study because of the varying structures of the corpora I am
using (see Section 1.5); however, I have generally found the above trend
among text types and genres to be the case in examining evidentiality and
perception verbs.17
1.5  The Data
Data for this study were drawn from a number of English and German
language corpora. These corpora represent various periods of English and
German as far back as the Early Modern Period. Although the focus of this
study is not on the historical development of evidential perception verbs,
I do feel that an historical perspective is prudent so we can see what if any
recent trends or developments are occurring, such as the evolution of new
complementationpatternsand/orevidentialuses.ForEnglish,theHelsinki

17	 Some work on the connection between deixis and text type/genre has already been
done. In Diewald (1991), for example, it was found that certain types of deixis (per-
sonal, locative, etc.) prefer certain discourse contexts over others. So, for example,
personal pronouns enjoy a higher frequency of usage in telephone conversations
than they do in objective scientific writing.

periods they represent, or where this is not the case (namely, eighteenth-
and nineteenth-century German), they are the most accessible and varied

occurrences of linguistic units, i.e. words), 551,000 of them coming from
the Early Modern section. Each section contains a broad variety of text
types. The Early Modern section is subdivided into three parts: 1500–1570
(190,160 tokens), 1570–1640 (189,800 tokens), and 1640–1710 (171,040
tokens). This distinction will not be made here, however; the entire Early
Modern English section will be treated as a unified whole. Citations from
the Helsinki text will include the file name, author, title, date (or date range
where exact date is unavailable), and page number. See Kytö (1996) for an
in-depth description of the Helsinki Corpus’s structure.
1.5.1.2  The ARCHER Corpus
ARCHER (A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers, here-
after ARCHER Corpus) is a large corpus with representative British and
American English texts from 1650 through 1990, so there is some overlap
with the Helsinki corpus. Texts in the ARCHER Corpus are grouped
into fifty-year periods (1650–1699, 1700–1749, etc.), and there are a total
of 1,789,309 tokens in the entire corpus. I will treat the ARCHER Corpus
as one unified whole, making note of dates only when the emergence
of new evidential complementation patterns or meanings may be con-
cerned. Because the amount of bibliographic information on the files in
the ARCHER Corpus varies, cited examples will also vary as to how much
bibliographic information is provided. At the least, the file name (which
50	 Chapter 1
includes the original date of publication), the author’s name, and the title
of the work will be indicated.

I have used the Kant and Goethe corpora as representative of eight-
eenth and nineteenth century German, given that there is no all-encom-
passing corpus that covers this period. Although there is not as much of a
variety of text types here as there are elsewhere, there is still a mixture of
fiction, philosophical writings, and personal correspondences.

1.6  Chapter Summary
Evidentiality is just as pervasive in English and German as it is in any other
language, even though it is, for the most part, not expressed by grammatical
means. We have seen that SP/Ws of English and German can mark eviden-
tial meaning in various ways, one of the most prominent classes of markers
being perception verbs. Perception verbs can be divided into the two broad
categories of subject-oriented and object-oriented perception verbs, and
each of these two types exhibits unique complementation patterns when
52	 Chapter 1
evidentialmeaningisexpressed.AnumberofEnglishandGermanlanguage
corpora provide the basis for the study of evidential perception verbs from
the Early Modern period to the present, to which we now turn.
Chapter 2
Visual Perception
As was already discussed in Chapter 1, visual perception enjoys prominence
among the other sensory modalities, so it should come as no surprise that
verbs of visual perception are the primary carriers of evidential meaning
among perception verbs as well (Whitt forthcoming). In this chapter, I
will examine the various ways the verbs of visual perception in English and
German express evidential meaning. First, the subject-oriented verbs see
and sehen will be discussed in light of data found in the various corpora.
Then I will turn to the object-oriented look and aussehen, also reporting
on the corpus-based findings. Finally, I will attempt to note any overarch-
ing, general tendencies that can be found, as well as any recent historical
developments which have occurred.
2.1  see
2.1.1  Quantitative Results
The verb see is the most prolific of the English perception verbs examined,
both in terms of overall occurrence and variety of evidential meanings
expressed. In the Early Modern English section of the Helsinki Corpus,
see occurs a total of 1,168 times. Of these attestations, ninety (7.7%) were
foundtoexpressevidentialmeaning,i.e.containadeicticmeaningpointing
to the SP/W’s evidence for the proposition. See is the most often attested
perception verb in the ARCHER Corpus as well, occurring a total of 3,119
times. In all, 280 (9%) of these instances are carriers of evidential meaning,
54	 Chapter 2
just a bit higher than the percentage in the Helsinki Corpus. The exact
breakdown of complementation patterns in these two corpora can be
found in Table 1:

2.1.2  <PV + FCC>
Most uses of see in this complementation pattern do not evince a purely
literal interpretation, i.e. there is almost always more involved that mere
visual perception. There are some instances, however, where vision does
provide evidence for what is indicated in the complementment clause.
Interestingly, in only one of the ten instances in the Helsinki Corpus where
the that-complementizer is present is direct vision indicated, whereas the
ARCHER Corpus readily has the complementizer occurring where the
use of visual evidence is intended:
(72)	 And soe at last I standinge still: I said if it bee a bible give it mee

1	 I initially intended to also provide quantitative results of the various evidential mean-
ings expressed within each respective complementation pattern (whether the type of
evidentiality expressed was visual, inferential, knowledge-based, etc.). This proved
virtually impossible when examining each individual example, which contains its
own fine-grained semantic and pragmatic idiosyncracies. For example, some cases of
visual evidentiality based on observation could also be considered to express varying
degrees of inferential meaning. So rather than establish overly rigid, inconsistent, and
artificial criteria, I will only report on the general semantic and pragmatic tendencies
of the data.

In (74), for example, the crocodile moving its upper jaw was an act that
could be visually perceived, and this visual perception is the evidence on
which Lauder draws to make his assertion. The case is slightly different in
(72), for here vision is not used as evidence to indicate a certain event is
occurring or has occurred, but rather to point to a certain state of affairs,
namelythattheobjectbeingobservedisaBible.Becausethespeakerimme-
diatelyrecognizedupon observation thatthe bookin hishandswasa Bible,
inference (see below) is not involved. There must have been tell-tale signs
for the speaker to report, rather than infer or suppose, this to be the case.
The use of the plural pronoun we in several of these examples indicates
that the visual evidence is not available only to the SP/W alone, but also
to everyone else who is or was present and able to perceive the event(s) in
question (i.e. intersubjective evidence). In (74) and (75), for instance, the
Visual Perception	 57
writers indicate that they simply share this visual evidence with others.
But there is an additional layer of intersubjective engagement in (77),
where the writers invites their audience to share a particular perspective
in viewing the scene. And in (73), it appears as if the author expects that
his readership shares his visual experience (evidence) and thus arrives at
the same conclusion.
Sometimes the evidential meaning is a bit broader, indicating that the
SP/W has arrived – via inference – at some sort of conclusion based on
the witnessing or observation of events. It is not uncommon to find the
that-complementizer absent in such uses:
(78)	 And soe on the other Side, we see many Times that forgetting and

(83)	 We therefore see that due to the slower rise of the probability for

‘On the Precise Measurement of the Critical Potentials of Gases’,
Proceedings of the Royal Society, London, Ser. A 107: 291–309)
Rather than report on a perceived event, the SP/W indicates that they
have inferred something based upon (visual) observation or witnessing.
In (80), for example, the speaker infers – based on what he has seen – that
the woman (Madam) with whom he is speaking knows what he’s trying to
say. Sometimes, the visual evidence is specified, as it is in (81): the speaker
infers from demeanor and clothing that those she is observing are young.
See can take multiple clauses in its scope as well:
(84)	Admirable well: I see, thou art so perfect in thy Lesson, that I
may spare my self, and thee the Labour of a farther examination.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1671cary.d2b, John Caryll, Sir Salomon; or
The Cautious Coxcomb)
Both clauses are reported based on observation and inference. First, the
speaker indicates that he has observed the addressee’s performance and
deems this to be ‘perfect’; then, based on this evidence, he judges that
further examination is not necessary. No one particular state or event is
being reported on as it is in (72) through (77), but rather the outcomes
of a series of events (or at least what the SP/Ws infer to be the outcomes)
is what falls within the scope of the evidential see in (78) through (84).
After all, no one is able to visually perceive the forgetting or forgiving of
(78); however, one can witness (visually perceive) what the results of these
apparent actions are, and thus arrive at a conclusion about what these non-
visible actions can achieve. Vision certainly plays a role here, but it is less
immediate than in cases of direct visual perception.
Finally, evidential see in the <PV + FCC> construction can take on
metaphoricalmeanings,namelythoseofknowledgeorunderstanding.Here,
the SP/W cites internal cognitive abilities of intellection as evidence:
Visual Perception	 59
(85)	 ‘I see’, quoth I, ‘that vicious men haue no wrong, tho they be said
by property of their mynde to beastes be transformd, tho in show
they kepe the forme of humayn body. And yet I wold not haue, that
the cruell & wicked mynde should be sharpnid by the fall of good
men.’(HelsinkiCorpus:CEBOETH2,QueenElizabeth(trans.),
Boethius (1593), pp. 84–5)
(86)	I now see plainly that Men cannot arrive at a full Satisfaction
by Riches, nor at Power by enjoying Principalities or Kingdoms,
nor at Esteem and Reverence by the Accession of Dignities, nor at
Nobility by Glory, nor at true Joy by carnal Pleasures. (Helsinki
Corpus:CEBOETH3,RichardPreston(trans.), Boethius (1695),
p. 124)
(87)	And I see that you must do it your own way. (ARCHER Corpus:
1951andr.d8a, Maxwell Anderson, Barefoot in Athens)
(88)	 And I see by reason and experience that nothing is more calculated
to arouse their contempt.(ARCHERCorpus:1988shus.h8a,Mar-
guerite Snow, ‘Revelation’, In God, Creation, and Revelation by
Paul K. Jewett, Grand Rapids, MI: W. B. Eerdmans, 1991)
Yet even when such metaphors are involved, one cannot deny that visual
perception continues to play a role. In (85), for example, Boethius must
have witnessed (seen) a series of events over time that helped shape his
understanding of human satisfaction. The source domain (vision) of the
Seeing is Knowing metaphor is almost always present, even when
the target domain (knowledge) finds itself in focus. In (88), on the other
hand, the writer actually cites reason and experience as the basis for her
knowledge. The metaphorical use of evidentialsee is not as prevalent as the
observation-inference use attested in (78) through (84).
Out of the forty-two instances of see appearing with the that-com-
plementizer in the ARCHER Corpus, seven are preceded by the modal
verb can/could, and of the forty cases without the complementizer, six are
modalized. The modal verb can was found to occur in cases where direct
visual perception is involved, as well as in cases where observation and
inference are signified:
60	 Chapter 2
(89)	 They were enough to tow all thro’ in 2 trips – but I can see he is in
no hurry. (ARCHER Corpus: 1853hall.j6b, William Hall, The
Diaries of William Hall, In Sea Saga, ed. Louise King-Hall et al.,
London: V. Gollancz, 1935)
(90)	We can see that he is looking at the other carefully while they talk.
Now he sways a little. (ARCHER Corpus: 1943haml.d7b, Patrick
Hamilton, The Duke in Darkness: A Play in Three Acts)
(91)	 But even from that distance, I could see that this man was no intel-
lectual giant. (ARCHER Corpus: 1976coov.f8a, Robert Coover,
The Public Burning)
One would normally not expect an item that falls within the scope of a
modal verb to still indicate evidential meaning. Consider I must see him
coming or I will see him coming, for instance. In both these cases, the speaker
does not indicate s/he has visual evidence for the proposition. Rather,
the modal verb cancels out the evidentiality because it has scope over the
item that would assume evidential meaning. So with must, for example,
an element of necessity is added, while with will, a comment on the future
is made. But in both cases, the speaker fails to indicate there is any actual
evidence available; s/he merely comments that the presence of such evi-
denceiseithernecessary,possible,orverylikely(butnotcertain).AsPalmer
(2001: 47) points out, however, English often couples a perception verb
with the modal verb can to indicate sensation, rather than ability (e.g. I
can see the moon, I can smell something burning, etc.). Exactly how much
modal meaning of physical (or mental) ability is indicated here remains
to be seen. Sometimes, one is tempted to analyze can as signaling physical
ability rather than mere idiom:
(92)	 Reaching a point which commanded a considerable view along the
side of the mountain, I could see that in many places the road was
completely lost to sight on account of the great snow-drifts piled up
on it. (ARCHER Corpus: 1892stoc.f6a, Frank Stockton, The
Dusantes)
Visual Perception	 61
Here, context suggests that the speaker arrived at a point on the mountain
that was conducive to physical observation, i.e. the speaker was able to see
that the road was lost to sight because of the snow. However, evidentiality
is still apparent because vision provides the evidence of the road’s being lost
to sight due to the snow drifts. I merely wish to point out that the modal
verb can does not necessarily cancel out an evidential reading,2 as all other
modal verbs would do. And even if ability indeed is what is indicated, an
act of seeing – whether that be visual or mental perception – still occurs, so
evidential meaning is still indicated when the modal verb can is present.
Different from the cases discussed above is the use of the present par-
ticiple seeing as a quasi-conjunction. Here, the speaker takes whatever falls
within the scope ofseeing for granted (in the protasis) and indicates it is the
reason for some other proposition (the apodosis); hence, as a conjunction,
seeing behaves similar to because. But there is an added evidential meaning
here: the perceptive nature of seeing allows for the speaker to indicate s/he
is in possession of some sort of evidence for the given proposition – which
is probably why the content of the proposition appears to be a given, i.e.
it is or at least ought to be clear – although it is oftentimes not exclusively
of a visual nature. Inference and knowledge can also play a role. The par-
ticular type of evidence involved varies from attestation to attestation, as
seen in (93) through (97):
(93)	 ‘What the good yere, master Moore’, quoth she, ‘I mervaile that

2	 This applies only to indicative can and could, and not subjunctive could. Since the
latter would mark irrealis possibility, as opposed to realis ability, there would be no
evidential meaning. For something to be evidential, there must be real – rather than
hypothetical or potential – evidence.

Visual Perception	 63
If any visual evidence is still to be indicated, it is much clearer in (93) than
in any other cases; after all, it is possible to visually perceive a house in
Chelsey, but no such thing is possible with the will of God (94) or diplo-
matic relations (97). The basis of the claim in (94), for example, appears
to be knowledge or understanding, and although this meaning appears in
(93) as well, there is also a visual component to the evidence as well. There
is more subjectivity here than with non-conjunctive see(ing). Whereas
the other evidential uses are already mildly subjective in that they indicate
not only perception of but also the speaker’s evidence for the proposition,
this conjunctive use adds in extra textual and metalinguistic commentary
(Traugott’s subjectification). And since seeing here is grammatically sub-
jectless, and yet embeds the speaker’s view of and evidence for the reported
event (hence the speaker is linguistically less self-aware), we also find ele-
ments of Langacker’s subjectivity at work. This is the one instance where
an evidential perception verb finds itself grammaticalized, in this case
transitioning from a lexical perception verb to a conjunction. And of all
twenty-fourattestationsofthisuseintheHelsinkiCorpus,onlyone(exam-
ple (94)) employs the that-complementizer. Perhaps this avoidance of the
complementizer is another indication thatseeing is, in this use, being gram-
maticalized.Afterall,non-conjunctiveevidentialusesof seeappearwiththe
complementizer a greater percentage of the time. Oddly enough, eight of
the twenty ARCHER attestations appear with the that-complementizer,
and all of the cases where the complementizer is absent occur either in the
seventeenth century or in the early part of the eighteenth century. And
ARCHERoffersonlytwentyattestationsofthisconstructionfora340year
period, whereas Helsinki boasts twenty-four cases for roughly a 200 year
period. The use ofseeing as a conjunction is alive and well in Contemporary
English, so in this case, the lack of attestations in the ARCHER Corpus
is most likely not an indicator of a decrease in usage of grammaticalized
seeing, but a more detailed study of this particular construction would be
necessary before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.
64	 Chapter 2
2.1.3  <PV + WH-CC>
The same types of evidential meaning one finds expressed by see in the
<PV + FCC> constellation can be found here as well. Of course, this
construction occurs far less often, and because some of the proposition’s
content is contained in the wh-word, the overall expression lacks a degree
of specificity. Consider:
(98)	 Now comparing all the Schooles which we have in (^England^),
with some that I read of in other countries, (that I may speak freely,
and without offence to any man, submitting my self herein also to
the judgement of those of my Profession) I do not know one that is
so compleated, as (perhaps) many might easily be, with all necessary
accommodations, and advantages to improve children to what they
are capable of, in their playing years, and wherein we evidently see,
how many places of education beyond the Seas, do quite outstrip us.
(Helsinki Corpus: CEEDUC3B, Charles Hoole, A New Discov-
ery of the Old Art of Teaching Schoole (1660), p. 217)
Hoole indicates with see that observation – and probably a certain degree
of inference – have led him to assert that foreign schools are ‘outstripping’
English schools. However, the how in the following clause fails to make
clear the nature of other schools’ supposed superiority to English schools
(exactly how are English schools being ‘outstripped’?). One could perhaps
argue that how in this instance is an emphatic marker coupled with many
to drive home the dire state of English education. In either case, we do
know that Hoole has observed the reported state of education to be the
case and indicates this with see, so the construction is evidential regardless.
Interestingly, see falls within the scope of another evidential marker (the
adverb evidently), so there is a double layer of evidential meaning here: one,
that the superiority of foreign schools is an intersubjective observation and
assessment (we … see), and that this is the most obvious reaction to what
already has been observed (evidently).
Themetaphoricalextensionofseeasamarkerofknowledgeandunder-
standing appears with this construction as well:

(99)	As the last year keeps slipping away, I think more and more of
our happy meeting; but for your love and comfort I think I should
have broken down … but now we both see how things are guided
for the best. (ARCHER Corpus: 1863tayl.d6b, Tom Taylor, The
Ticket-of-Leave-Man,InPlaysbyTomTaylor,ed.MartinBanham,
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985)
Although the proposition within the scope of see does not indicate exactly
how ‘things are guided for the best’, this is indicated earlier in the discourse
(the effects of the ‘happy meeting’ on the speaker). And now the speaker
indicatesthathe,alongwithhisaddressee,knowthismeetingtohaveindeed
been the best possible scenario, and this knowledge is signified by see.
There were two instances, both from the ARCHER Corpus, where
the modal verb can takes see in its scope. In one instance (100), vision and
observation are indicated; the other case (101) is one of knowledge and
understanding:
(100)	 I can see what you do. (ARCHER Corpus: 1957lark.f8b, Philip
Larkin, A Girl in Winter)
(101)	 I could see what she meant. (ARCHER Corpus: 1951marq.f8a,
John Phillips Marquand, Melville Goodwin, USA)
As in (89) through (92), the modal verb does not cancel out any evidential
meaning; at the most, it indicates the speaker was physically able to visually
or mentally ‘see’ a certain state of affairs. At the least, the appearance ofcan
isidiomatic.Andaswithothercasesofthe<PV+WH-CC>construction,

This use is clearly not restricted to the present tense, as is shown by (103).
The SP/W can provide evidence for a past action that they witnessed, in
this case the assembling of numerous sailors. There are a few instances
where, rather than direct visual perception, evidential see mandates the
observation/witnessing reading:

68	 Chapter 2
placed at the forefront. There were two cases of the infinitive complement
being preceded by the infinitive particle to, one in the Helsinki Corpus
and one in the ARCHER Corpus:
(110)	 Such a Schoole then as may be fit for the education of all sorts of
children (for we have seen the very poorest to have come to digni-
ties of preferment by being learned) should be situated in a City or

ally addicted, and sufficiently accommodated to entertain Tablers,
and are unanimously well-affected towards Piety, Learning, and
Vertue.(HelsinkiCorpus:CEEDUC3B,CharlesHoole,ANew

(111)	 GOV. MORTON: Davenport, you can help me. And you are the
only man who can. I’ve got an order to deliver and it is a very
delicate one and I don’t know just how it is going to be received.
It may cost me the friendship of the man I must deliver it to.
	 GRIFFITH: Why don’t you mail it with a fine letter?
	 GOV. MORTON:<Gettingupandgoingtowindow>Thatwon’t
do. It is from the President – it is confidential and it is to one of
my very dear friends and I am ordered to deliver it in person.
	 GRIFFITH: From the President? I – I see nothing to do but to
deliver it. (ARCHER Corpus: 1899hern.d6a, James Herne, The
ReverendGriffithDavenport,In America’sLostPlays,ed.Barrett
Clark, 1940)
The existence of the infinitive particle in (110) appears to add an aspectual
flavoring to the sentence (contrast with we have seen the very poorest have
come to dignities …): there is a greater sense of the completedness of the
action than when the particle is present, i.e. perfectivity is emphasized by
the presence of the infinitive marker. The evidence signified by see is also
slightly different here. Rather than signal the witnessing of an event, here
the focus is the end-point of the event. There is less a sense of direct visual
perception and more a sense of bearing witness to a process and its out-
come (poor children succeeding in education). In (111), see is used more
metaphorically in a sense of knowing or understanding. Griffith concludes,
Visual Perception	 69
after his exchange with Governor Morton, on how important the item in
questionisandthatpersonaldeliveryisindeedthebest–andonly–option
available to the governor. A possible paraphrase might be something like
I can think of nothing else to do but to deliver it. See is definitely indicative
of a mental, rather than a perceptual, process. In addition, the absence of
the infinitive particle to would render this sentence ungrammatical, and
there is no aspectual flavoring contributed by the particle as there is in
(110). This is no doubt due to the fact that nothing to do is a special con-
struction unto itself (I see nothing to do, I have nothing to do, etc.). I have
included in the <PV + DO + NFV> category, however, because nothing
does function as a direct object of the perception verb and there is a non-
finite verb present in the form of to do. This combination of nothing with
to do occurs readily in English, and it just happens to occur in an evidential
construction in (111).
I also found two instances of evidential see falling within the scope of
the cognitive verb think:
(112)	 I thought I saw Jack Temple and his wife pass by me to-day in
their coach – but I took no notice of them. (ARCHER Corpus:
1710swft.x3b, Jonathan Swift, The Journal to Stella: AD 1710–
1713, ed. Frederick Ryland, London: G. Bell and Sons, 1924,
pp. 5–6)
(113)	 Methought I saw a concealed joy sparkle in his eyes, while, with
a harsh and unfeeling tone he pronounced these words: ‘Prepare
yourself for the worst! – your wife is dead!’ (ARCHER Corpus:
1799lee-.f4a, Harriet Lee, Constantia de Valmont)
In these cases, the evidential meaning is not totally absent, but rather, it
is made tentative. That is, the speaker indicates that s/he believes s/he has
visual evidence to assert the proposition, which in a sense provides two
layers of evidential meaning: one of belief and one of perception. The
visual evidence is indeed existent; it is only subject to the mental evidence
in whose scope it falls. Example (113) is also interesting because joy cannot

70	 Chapter 2
visual evidence – eye contact – to infer that the man in question brought
the news of the wife’s death with ‘concealed joy’.
2.1.4.2  Present Participle
Aspect assumes a prominent role when a present participle is used as the
verbal complement in the <PV + DO + NFV> complementation pat-
tern. Here, there is an emphasis on the progressive nature of the unfolding
events:
(114)	 And Iohn bare record saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
heaven, like a Doue, and it abode vpon him. (Helsinki Corpus:
CNTEST2, The New Testament (1611), I, 20)
Contrast this with (115):
(115)	 And Iohn bare recorde sayinge: I sawe the sprete descende from
heven,lykevntoadove,andabydeaponhim…(HelsinkiCorpus:
CNTEST1, William Tynsdale (trans.), The New Testament
(1534), I, 20)
In (115), the event is reported as a mere past occurrence, but in (114), atten-
tion is drawn to the on-going descent of the Spirit from heaven. Additional
focus is on the process of the descent, thanks to the progressive aspectual
meaning carried by the present participle. This is also the case with the
majority of cases found in the ARCHER Corpus:
(116)	 I saw at that time (saith the Observer) the Sun, in a sky every
where serene enough, being yet some degrees above the Horizon,
and shining very bright, yet lancing out very long and reddish
rays, 40 or 50 degrees toward the Zenith … (ARCHER Corpus:
1674leew.s2b,AnthonzLeewenhoeck,‘TouchingtheCompres-
sion of the Air’, Philosophical Transactions 10.114)
(117)	 This morning early, the wind came about to the westward, and
we saw the French fleet in a line, standing to the southward about
Visual Perception	 71
4 leagues distant. (ARCHER Corpus: 1704poco.j3b, Thomas
Pocock, Sea Diary, In Memoirs Relating to Lord Torrington,
Camden Society New Series)
(118)	 I saw the left of the enemy hesitating, and some pressing towards
their centre, the sowars in rapid retreat. (ARCHER Corpus:
1858peo2.n6b, The People’s Paper)
(119)	 When I got out of the patch of long grass I was in, I saw twenty
or thirty of the great beasts charging up and down the line and
throwingheadlessbodiesintheair,forthefirstthingyourelephant
does is to pull off the head. (ARCHER Corpus: 1925garn.f7b,
David Garnett, The Sailor’s Return)
So in (119), for example, the charging of the beasts is reported as an on-
going, rather than a completed (perfective) event. (Perfectivity is generally
signaled by an infinitive complement.) There are also cases of inferential
evidentiality similar to (113):
(120)	 SayratherofrevivingGuilt;away!IseeDishonourflaminginyour
Eyes, impure Desire, and base degenerate Thoughts, like mounting
Winds with unresisting Force have ruffed all that gentle calm of
Love: How can you say you love, what you profess to ruin? You
said you lov’d my Virtue, and yet seek to sully and pollute it with
Dishonour. So Tigers love their Prey, and so pursue <persue> it.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1706estc.d3b, Richard Estcourt, The Fair
Example: or The Modish Citizens)
(121)	 You are not so cruel – I see pardon beaming from your eye, and
frolic smiling on your cheek. (ARCHER Corpus: 1785macn.d4b,
Leonard MacNally, Fashionable Levities)
In (120), eye contact is the visual evidence that leads to the speaker infer-
ring that the addressee has dishonorable motives, even though he claims
otherwise. And in (121), facial gestures are observed to infer the addressee’s
state of being. As with infinitives, see coupled with a present participle can
signal that the speaker uses observation as evidence, rather than a single
act of visual perception:
72	 Chapter 2
(122)	 I see the country going to ruin, and no man with brains enough
to save it. (ARCHER Corpus: 1768.walp.x4b, Horace Walpole,
Selected Letters of Horace Walpole, ed. W. S. Lewis, New Haven:
Yale University Press, 1973, pp. 144–5)
There are also four cases of the cognitive verb think taking scope over the
perception verb and its complements (only two examples given here):
(123)	 Andyet,methinksIseetheblindragg’dBoyLaughingthetott’ring
Globe out of my hand: It must not, shall not be. (ARCHER
Corpus: 1686fane.d2b, Sir Francis Fane, The Sacrifice)
(124)	 MethinksIseehisstarshiningintheheavens.(ARCHERCorpus:
1837ains.f5b, William Harrison Ainsworth, Crichton)
The visual evidence is made tentative in these sentences because the speaker
cannot report with absolute certainty that this evidence exists, but it is not
negated because even though the presence of think/methinks qualifies the
evidence, it does point in the direction of certainty (positive evidence)
rather than doubt or negated evidence. And in (123), the speaker is not
reporting on an absolute state of affairs, but rather on a perceived state,
i.e. the boy (scornfully and metaphorically) laughing the globe out of the
his hand. Here, see has been bleached of much of its visual meaning and
become an indicator of general perception (or even imagination). Some
sense of vision still exists, though, because the speaker can imagine the
globe leaving his hands – a visually perceivable event. In addition to these
two cases, there are six instances in the ARCHER Corpus where see falls
within the scope of the modal verb can/could. In all but one of these cases,
direct visual perception is involved:
(125)	 AT half past three o’clock the signal was given to disengage the bal-
loon from the earth, when it rose in near a perpendicular direction
moving very slowly, during which time we could see the Doctor
waving his hat to the spectators who were very numerous on the
occasion, and proceeded well towards Yarmouth. (ARCHER
Corpus: 1785gen1.n4b, The General Evening Post)
Visual Perception	 73
(126)	 I looked round and round me, as we jogged along over the height,
down on the far distant country, that spread out as if it had been
a great big picture, with hills, and fields, and woods; and I could
still see to the norward the ships lying at their anchors on the sea,
and the shores of Fife far, far beyond it. (ARCHER Corpus:
1828moir.f5b, David Macbeth Moir,The Life of Mansie Wauch,
Tailor in Dalkeith)
In one attestation, can appears to function more as a marker of a displaced
event: the actual event occurs at a time previous to the speech event, even
though the present tense of the verb is used:
(127)	 I can see him now sitting at this table here and all of us quiet
as mice while he ate. (ARCHER Corpus: 1964berg.f8b, John
Berger, Corker’s Freedom)
The speaker is recounting a recurring past event where his father was sit-
ting at the table and everyone else remained silent. This event was visually
perceived, so see remains evidential. But the presence of the present tense
on the modal verb plus the adverb now is a narrative strategy used to frame
this as a current recollection of a past event.
2.1.4.3  Past Participle
When a past participle appears as the non-finite verbal complement, either
a passive event or a resultant state is presented:
(128)	 And then wee came farther where frendes meetinge place was &
there wee stayde all night & there was ye same report alsoe: &

(132)	 And indeed the case I met with, in which the disorder (and in no

the most powerful antiseptics faithfully administered, which not
only failed of success, but did not even mitigate the symptoms,
was what first led me to enquire more minutely into the nature
of the disease, and of the remedies which had been used with most
success in its cure. (ARCHER Corpus: 1769bard.m4a, Samuel

B. Hamley, The Life of Sir Edward Bruce Hamley, vol. II, ed.

In (128), it is unclear whether the erection of the pulpit is being witnessed
or whether the pulpit was already erected when the report was made, and
George Fox is only reporting on an event which already occurred. If the
case is the former, then this is merely a passive report: Fox reports that he
and those who were with him witnessed a pulpit being erected, but he does
not mention who was doing the work. But if the case is the latter, where
the pulpit was already erected when witnessed, then there is an additional
resultant meaning alongside the passive meaning: Fox is pointing to a cur-
rent state of affairs (the pulpit already being erected) that is the result of
previous actions (the actual erection of the pulpit). This could also be the
case in (129). Are the things being accomplished during the narrative, or
is their accomplishment merely being reported ex post facto? In any case,
(129) evinces more a sense of witnessing than the direct visual percep-
tion of a single event, as is the case with see in (108) for instance. In (130),
(133), and (135), the speaker provides visual evidence for a current state of
affairs which results from an already performed action. For example, in
(130), the child’s coat has already been stained with blood; the staining
occurred previously to the visual perception. So the patient of the action,
rather than the agent, serves as the direct object in constructions involving
76	 Chapter 2
the past participle. In (131), (132), and (134), the event being described is
perceived as it happens, although the agent is often obscured. In (132), the
author saw that antiseptics were administered to the child, but he fails to
mention who is responsible for the administration, probably because it is
irrelevant to the discourse.
There are two instances of the cognitive verb think taking scope over
the evidential see, and it signals the same tentative visual evidence it does
when infinitives or present participles are involved:
(136)	 Oh! to be sure, he is a most amiable creature; I think I see him
now, seated on his cushion, a bowl of sherbet by his side, and a long
pipe in his mouth. (ARCHER Corpus: 1794rows.d4a, Susanna
Rowson, Slaves in Algiers or a Struggle for Freedom)
(137)	 I think I have seen it in one case seated in the ligaments of the
liver, and giving rise to very obscure and anomalous symp-
toms. (ARCHER Corpus: 1820aber.m5b, John Abercrombie,
‘Researches on the Pathology of the Intestinal Canal. Part II’,
Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal 16)
In (137), a doctor is describing a case of gangrene he believes he witnessed
in the liver, and the verb see also takes a present participle (giving) in its
scope. Neither case attests a passive semantics; both describe a current state
which is the result of previous actions.
I also found a few instances of an evidential perception verb occurring
alongside a direct object and past participle, but not in the linear order
suggested by the <PV + DO + NFV> label. For one, there is an instance
of evidential see occurring in a relative clause, which naturally alters the
syntax of the construction:
(138)	 I thought it the more so, as the accounts which I had received of
Washington while at Philadelphia, and the plan which I had
seen hung up in the dining-room at Bladensburg, had prepared
me for something rather more advanced. (ARCHER Corpus:
1795twin.j4b, Thomas Twining, Travels in America)
Visual Perception	 77
Here, the city plan is seen hung up in the dining room, hence the present
state of previous action. But since plan is modified by a relative clause, in
which evidential see appears, the relative pronoun/direct object which
precedes the perception verb and its past participle complement. So the
order here is more like DO + PV + NFV. I consider this merely to be the
manifestation of <PV + DO + NFV> in relative clauses, so there is no
need to create another typological category to account for this construc-
tion. In another instance, I found that the direct object appeared after the
past participle, although extraposition to the right or, more likely, the fact
that the direct object is so long (syntagmatically) accounts for this:
(139)	 In cool blood, yet with firm attachment, we now see blended in
her, the peerlessness of enterprise, the deportment, ardor and hero-
ism of the veteran, with the milder graces, vigor and bloom of her
secreted,softersex.(ARCHERCorpus:1797mann.f4a,Deborah
Sampson and Herman Mann, The Female Review)
It appears that general observation rather than literal vision is involved
here: one cannot visually perceive peerlessness, ardor, heroism, etc., but
one can observe/witness traits commonly associated with these attributes,
and that is what is signified by the verb see in (139).
2.1.4.4  Non-Evidential Readings
There were also a few instances where the <PV + DO + NFV> pattern
failed to yield evidential readings, but this is no doubt due to other sen-
tential factors. When a conditional conjunction appears in a clause and
indicates a hypothetical state of affairs, for example, any possible eviden-
tial reading is negated because the conditional here implies a non-existent
state. And the non-existence of evidence means no evidence, and lack of
evidence entails the absence of evidentiality. Consider (140):
78	 Chapter 2
(140)	 So, if I can see this Girl well match’d, I shall think the Pains I
have been at in coming to this stinking Town are well rewarded.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1730mott.d3b, John Mottley, The Widow
Bewitch’d)
The point is that, at the current juncture, the girl in question is not ‘well
match’d’, so there can be no evidence that is the case. That, plus the fact
that see in this instance probably means more see to it that rather than to
perceive visually. But even if this is not the case, and the speaker wishes
more to convey a sense of imagination or general perception, the seman-
tics of conditionals disallow any evidential reading here. Perhaps the case
is clearer in (141):
(141)	 After priuat praier I saw a mans Legg dressed, took order for
thinges in the house, and wrough tell dinner time … (Helsinki
Corpus: CEDIAR2B (Margaret Hoby,Diary of Lady Margaret
Hoby (1599–1605), p. 72)
Here,seedoesnotdenoteanactofvisualperception,butratherindicatesthe
speakertookanactiveroleinarrangingfortheman’slegtobedressed(apar-
aphrase would read something like I saw to it that …). There is one instance
of evidential see and a present participle occurring with the modal can and
a temporal conjunction, and here, evidential meaning is also absent:
(142)	 Before we can see the miracle of nations entering the kingdom
of God … the Church mst be raised nearer to the standards of
New Testament efficiency. (ARCHER Corpus: 19xxcadm.h7b,
SamualCadman,‘ANewDayforMissions’,InTheWorld’sGreat
Sermons, vol. X, ed. G. Kleiser, London: Funk & Wagnalls,
1909)
Theeventdescribedhere–theviewingofthenationsenteringthekingdom
of God – has yet to come to pass. In fact, another event, the betterment of
the Church, is a necessary precursor to this. Therefore, since the event has
yet to occur, it hasn’t occurred at all. And as we’ve already made clear, there
Visual Perception	 79
can be no evidence for non-existent events. On a final note, the presence
of a negator in a clause generally cancels out any evidential meaning that
may be present. Consider:

Since the evidential see falls within the scope of the negative particle not,
it is negated. And since evidentiality involves the reporting of speaker evi-
dence for a claim, negated evidence – or the absence of evidence – means
no evidence at all. In (144), for example, the speaker explains that there is
no visual evidence to assert that the man in question drank anything. The
case would be different with I saw him drink nothing or I saw that he didn’t
drink anything, where the speaker indicates there is evidence that a male
referent did not drink. But here, there is an absence of visual perception
(evidence), and evidential meaning is therefore also absent. None of these
non-evidential readings of see are included in the breakdown in Table 1.

as there are of the previously discussed construction types. When they do
occur, they exhibit just as much polysemy as other complementation pat-
terns. They can indicate direct observation and consequential inference:

Clearly nothing is being directly seen in several of these cases. One cannot,
for example, directly see effectuality, but one is able to witness events or
outcomes and then infer what can be deemed effectual. The case is similar
in(149),wherealthoughpainitselfisnotvisuallyperceivable,people’sreac-
tions to it are. So here the writer infers from the actions of G. that he was in
much pain. In (148), auditory perception would seem to play a larger role
than visual perception, even though a general, non-modal specific sense of
‘observation’ is also possible. In any case, the meaning here is not limited to
vision. There were a few cases (2 in Helsinki, 2 in ARCHER) of the modal
verb can appearing in the parenthetical construction:
(150)	 And this is the lest poynt that any man may with his saluacion

Corpus: 1839plan.d5b, James Robinson Planché, The Garrick
Fever, In Plays by James Robinson Planché, ed. Donald Roy,
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986)
Thomas More’s understanding – or his ability to understand – of human
salvation is at issue in (150), while in (151), the speaker infers from observa-
tion of physical attributes that the woman in the chaise is old. Literal vision
is always apparent in all cases of parenthetical see, but it is never the sole
meaning and there are always additional evidential meanings of inference,
observation, and general perception. In addition, the presence of the con-
junction as centers the act of interpretation on the speaker, while leaving
open the possibility that others may arrive at different conclusions when
perceiving the same material or examining the same data. Thus there is an
increased degree of intersubjective engagement here because not only do
the SP/Ws make their claim, but they implicitly acknowledge that others
may perceive the evidence differently or at least arrive at alternate conclu-
sions when examining the same evidence (Nuyts 2001: 122–9; cf. Ifantidou
2001: 119–59, Hyland 2005: 183).
2.1.6  <EXT>
The evidential use of see external to the ‘evidentialized’ clause also evinces
a broad variety of types of evidence. Direct visual perception is one:
(152)	 That night late his body was found in a ditch, about a mile out
of town, near St. Pancras church. His sword was thrust through
him, but no blood was on his clothes or about him. His shoes were
clean,hismoneywasinhispocket:butnothingwasabouthisneck,
and a mark was all round it, an inch broad, which shewed he was
strangled. His breast was likewise all over marked with bruises,
and his neck was broken. All this I saw; for Lloyd and I went to
view his body. (Helsinki Corpus: CEHIST3A, Gilbert Burnet,
82	 Chapter 2
Burnet’s History of My Own Time (Part I: The Reign of Charles
II) (1640–1710), 1, II, 164)
(153)	 Oons, Madam, they’re broke in to the House with Fire and Sword,
I saw them, heard them, they’ll be here this Minute. (Helsinki
Corpus: CEPLAY3B, George Farquhar, The Beaux Stratagem
(1707), p. 60)
In both these cases, the events in question are directly seen by the SP/W.
And in (153), the home invasion was also heard, hence the appearance of
evidential heard alongside saw. And this visual perception provides the
evidence the SP/W needs to back up the content of the proposition. There
is also a more general meaning of see here, where long-term observation
and witnessing provide the evidence:
(154)	 All that is so, long must last & holde togither, as it is one, but
must needes perish & decay, whan so it leaves to be; as in beastes
we see, when they ingender, & be made of lyfe & body, then it is
a Creature. (Helsinki Corpus: CEBOETH2, Queen Elizabeth,
Boethius (1593), p. 66)
(155)	 Aninquisitiuemanisapratler:sovponthelikereason,acredulous

beleeue rumors, will as easily augment rumors, and adde some-
what to them of his owne, which (^Tacitus^) wisely noteth, when
he sayth: (\Fingunt simul creduntq\) ; so great an affinitie hath
fiction and beleefe. (Helsinki Corpus: CEEDUC2B, Francis
Bacon, The Twoo Bookes of the Proficience and Advancement of
Learning (1605), 21V)
In both these cases, the writers point to (intersubjective) observation of
certain behaviors or phenomena as evidence for their assertions: the life
cycle in (154) and the behavior of credulous men in (155). Visual percep-
tion nonetheless occurs, for the events described in both examples are
capable of being observed visually. There is simply more being observed
than a one-time event, as is the case with (152) and (153). The other use of
Visual Perception	 83
the evidential see in <EXT> constructions is to express inference on the
part of the speaker:
(156)	 I expect every hour the definitive sentence that must separate us
for ever – I am sure you feel for me – I see you do – pardon these
tears! (ARCHER Corpus: 1764walp.f4b, Horace Walpole,The
Castle of Otranto)
(157)	 Nay, <egad,> I am sure you do admire her extremely, I see it in
youreyes.(ARCHERCorpus:1766garr.d4b,DavidGarrick,The
Country Girl, In The Plays of David Garrick, vol. 4, ed. Gerald
M. Berkowitz, New York: Garland Publishing, 1981)
But as with all cases of inferential evidentiality expressed by see, visual
observation is at least in part responsible for this inference, which is espe-
cially clear in (152) (cf. (113), (120), and (121)). There are three instances of
see in its <EXT> use falling within the scope of can, two of which signify
observation and subsequent inference:
(158)	 Major Sanford’s example has had great influence upon our society
ingeneral;andthoughsomeofourolddonsthinkhimratherlicen-
tious; yet, for aught <ought> Ican see, he is as strict an observer of
decorum, as the best of them. (ARCHER Corpus: 1797fost.f4a,
Hannah Webster Foster, The Coquette, or the History of Eliza
Wharton)
(159)	 I’m optimistic in your case, and I have seen a world of malad-
justment. There’s hope for you. You don’t really want to destroy
yourself. You’re trying hard to keep your feelings open, Wilhelm. I
can see it. (ARCHER Corpus: 1951bell.f8a, Saul Bellow, Seize
the Day)
So in (158), the speaker infers from observing Major Sanford’s behavior
that this official is a strict ‘observer of decorum’. Wilhelm’s behavior is
most likely what leads to the speaker’s inference in (159). The one other
use of see in its <EXT> use that occurs with the modal verb can has a more
metaphorical sense of understanding:
84	 Chapter 2
(160)	 There is much in it that is not authentic, merely fanciful, & quasi-
sentimental–I can see now.(ARCHERCorpus:1900bent.x7b,
Arnold Bennett, Letters of Arnold Bennett, vol. II: 1889–1915,
ed. James Hepburn, London: Oxford University Press, 1968,
pp. 135–6)
The writer here expresses his understanding metaphorically via the percep-
tion verb see. Of course, visual perception is not totally absent here either,
for Bennett is reacting to his experience of watching an ordination process.
And watching this process helped shape his view that much inauthenticity
exists. Vision may not be at the forefront of many evidential meanings of
theverbsee,butweobservetimeandagainthatvisualperceptionisinescap-
able when dealing with evidentiality. The evidence itself may not directly
have to do with such vision, but at the same time, it might well have been
acquired through visual perception to begin with.
2.1.7  Summary of see
When used evidentially, the verb see expresses a wide variety of meanings.
This should come as no surprise since the polysemy is no less rich with
non-evidential uses of this perception verb. In the <PV + FCC> pattern,
the most prominent of the complementation patterns, direct perception
is sometimes indicated, although observation and inference enjoy greater
prominence. The metaphorical notions of knowing and understanding are
also occasionally expressed by see in this complementation pattern. The
same holds for the <PV + WH-CC> construction. With the <PV + DO
+ NFV> structure, the second most frequently used construction, literal
perception is much more likely to be expressed, but other possibilities are
not excluded. When the non-finite verb is an infinitive, the event(s) seen
or observed are presented in their totality (perfective aspect), whereas a
present participle adds a progressive aspectual flavoring. The past parti-
ciple, on the other hand, often presents the event in a ‘passive’ sense: i.e.
the agent of action can be obscured in the discourse. In addition, the past
Visual Perception	 85
participle also can present a current state which is the result of previous
action, hence provide a resultant meaning to the described event. Par-
entheticals (<PARENTH>) favor internal evidence (mostly inference),
although literal perception is occasionally expressed as well. Finally, when
functioning externally (<EXT>) to the proposition in question, evidential
see can express both literal, more indirect, or metaphorical modes of visual
perception. As an evidential marker, see signals both literal visual evidence
and more abstract, metaphorical evidence related to intellection across its
various complementation patterns, and both types of evidence appear to
be expressed at relatively the same rate.

2.2.1  Quantitative Results
As with English see, German sehen is the most prolific evidential percep-
tion verb found in the examined corpora. In the Bonner Corpus of Early
New High German, there are a total of 852 attestations of sehen, and thirty
(3.5%) of these attestations are carriers of evidential meaning. In the Kant
Corpus, 1,756 instances of sehen can be found, sixty-eight (3.9%) being
evidential. The Goethe Corpus provides us with 3,555 attestations of sehen,
274 (7.7%) used evidentially. And in the DWDS Corpus, I found a remark-
ably low percentage of evidential uses: out of a random sample of 1,500
cases of sehen, only nineteen (1.3%) signaled evidential meaning. The exact
breakdown of complementation patterns is given in Table 2:

Several tendencies of evidential sehen mirror those of see. For one, Types
I and III complementation patterns enjoy the highest frequency of usage.
And excepting the Goethe Corpus, Type I is used more frequently than
Type III. There are far fewer cases of Types II, VII, and VIII. There was
also one instance of a nonce construction in the corpora: one attestation
of the Type IV construction – which generally favors object-oriented per-
ception verbs – occurring in the Kant Corpus. And unlike the English see,
sehen’s present participle form (sehend) does not lend itself to uses either
as a conjunction in the <PV + FCC> pattern or as the non-finite verbal
complement in <PV + DO + NFV> constructions.

sie sich in einer Folge einzelner Entwickelungen zeigt. (Goethe

(1817–1824), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 13, S. 99)
	 ‘If we inspect the growth more closely, then we see that where
the plant continues from joint to joint, from leaf to leaf, by
sprouting sprouts, a reproduction also occurs, and this propa-
gation differs from that which occurs with flowers and fruit,
which occurs at once, and it is different insofar as it is succes-
sive, that shows itself to result as a consequence of a series of
individual developments.’
In (162), for example, the speaker has visual evidence for describing the
procedure of distributing food leftovers from a wedding because he has
personally seen this happen. In (164), the syntax of the initial clause – the
placement of the verb in initial position – appears to indicate some sort
of conditionality, and one would not expect conditional semantics to be
conducive to evidential meaning. After all, the conditional makes reference
to a yet nonexistent or unfulfilled state or action. And since this has yet to
come to pass, there can be no evidence for that which has yet to occur (and
may never occur at all). But in (164), the scenario and evidence are very
real, not merely possible. In this case, the inspection of the plants – which
provides the evidence for reporting on floral reproduction – is not pre-
sented as some hypothetical, non-existent action, but rather as a ‘next step’
in a series of observations. Actual, current observation, rather than possible
observation, of the plant’s growth provides very real evidence here.
There is one instance of the modal verb können ‘can’ having scope over
sehen in the DWDS Corpus, and here literal vision is also signaled:
(165)	 Ueberall konnte ich sehen, daß der Fuchs genau die Fährte hielt.
(DWDS Corpus: ‘Fuchsgeschichten’, in: Berliner Tageblatt
(Morgen-Ausgabe) (2.3.1904), S. 7)
	 ‘I could see everywhere that the fox maintained the scent
exactly.’
Visual Perception	 89
As with cases of the modal verb can in English, evidential meaning remains
intact because the additional modal meaning of ability does not in any
way diminish the meaning expressed by the perception verb, i.e. the event
here was still seen, and the writer merely adds that he was able to see the
fox hunt.
More often one finds sehen employed to mark observation and sub-
sequent inference on the part of the SP/W. Visual perception can still be
gleaned from the meaning, but only indirectly:
(166)	 Und die gedoppelte Gnade habe ich erfahren / als ich sahe / daß

	 ‘We see that the people’s standard of living has become better,
and moreover, the further expansion of the railway system will
influence economic development positively.’
In (166), the writer is obviously incapable of physically viewing abstract
conceptssuchassafetyandnecessity,buthecaninferfromobservationand
experience that Poliarchus is safe and that he need not reveal his secrets.
Kant no doubt bases his conclusions on what he has observed through his
experiences,althoughin(168),directobservationishighlyunlikely.Rather,
Kant’s evidence is more likely evidence which he has acquired through
the acquisition of information (news, hearsay, etc.), rather than through
direct observation of France’s national assembly and other governmental
institutions. In (167), on the other hand, direct observation is probably
more likely because Kant has been able to directly observe the behavior of
fellow philosophers. Example (168) is particularly interesting because, as
the translation indicates, soviel stands in apposition to the complementizer
clause and functions as the direct object ofsehe, but the rest of the syntax is
congruent with the Type I complementation pattern. Hence this example
is subsumed in the <PV + FCC> category. In both (168) and (169), there
is no literal event being observed; however, Goethe indicates with the use
of sehen in (169) that certain events or phenomena can be observed that
can lead one to make claims about such abstract topics as adept manners of
imitation, the free will, and safety. Direct observation is indicated in (161)
through (165), whereas indirect observation is marked in (166) and (170).
But the evidence for the assertion is provided nonetheless by observation.
Visual Perception	 91
Inference can be said to play a role here as well, insofar as part of these asser-
tions is based on inference from observation rather than from observation
alone. The assertion in (170) that the standard of living has gone up, as well
as the positive consequences railroad expansion will have, are supported
by personal observation of economic behavior and material culture. One
singular event is not being witnessed, but rather general social tenden-
cies and behaviors – which although abstract on one level, are observable
phenomena – provide evidence for the assessment of the current and near
future state of affairs. As in English, intersubjectivity is indicated when
the plural pronoun serves as the grammatical subject of the clause in (169)
and (170): the writers engage with their audience in the presentation of
the perceptual knowledge as shared evidence, and they expect their audi-
ence to arrive at the same conclusions based on this evidence, e.g., that the
standard of living has become better in (170).
Therearecases,however,wherethesenseofinferenceisattheforefront
of evidential meaning and observation is a mere given:
(171)	 Ich sehe, daß du bist voller bitterer Galle und verknüpft mit
Ungerechtigkeit. (Kant Corpus: AA X, Briefwechsel (1774), S.
161)
	 ‘I see that you are full of bitter gall and associated with
injustice.’

	 ‘I see, you hesitate, you gaze at the beautiful figure without
being able to destroy it.’
(173)	 ich suchte nach meinem Schuster und fand ihn bald in der Vor-

aus, junger Herr, daß Ihr ein wunderlicher Christ seid’. (Goethe
Corpus: Dichtung und Wahrheit (1811–1833), Hamburger Aus-
gabe, Band 9, S. 319)
	 ‘Ilookedformyshoemakerandsoonfoundhimintheoutskirts,
sitting on his footstool, and he received me kindly and after he

had read the letter, said smilingly: “From this I see, young man,
that you are a peculiar Christian.”’
(174)	 sie betrachtete die Lage der Karten sorgfältig, schien aber zu
stocken und wollte mit der Sprache nicht heraus. – ‘ich sehe schon’,
sagte die jüngere, die mit der Auslegung einer solchen magischen
Tafel schon näher bekannt war, ‘Ihr zaudert und wollt meiner
Schwester nichts Unangenehmes eröffnen; aber das ist eine ver-
wünschte Karte!’ (Goethe Corpus: Dichtung und Wahrheit
(1811–1833), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 9, S. 392)
	 ‘She examined the position of the cards meticulously, but
appeared to hesitate and didn’t want to speak. “I already see”,
said the younger girl, who was already more familiar with the
interpretation of such a magic board, “you hesitate and don’t
want to disclose anything unpleasant to my sister; but that is
an accursed card!”’
In (172), direct observation leads to the inferential evidentiality, whereas
the contents of a letter cause the shoemaker to infer that the young man is
a ‘peculiar Christian’ (173). Magical signs – or more precisely, the obser-
vation and consequent interpretation thereof – lead to inference in (174).
After all, interpretation is nothing more than inference based on the con-
ceptualization of a set of data. These cases show that the basis of inference
(i.e. observed phenomena) can range from purely physical occurrences to
the interpretation of already perceived signs.

	 ‘Sulzer’s theory was always abhorrent to me because of its incor-

Of course, this understanding or knowledge may well be arrived at via
observation and inference. That is, inference and observation are prob-
ably responsible for shaping the speaker’s knowledge in (175). Sometimes
it is impossible to disambiguate the evidential meanings, i.e. readings of
inferential evidentiality or speaker-based knowledge are equally possible.
This demonstrates that sometimes visual perception is not even absent
from metaphorical senses of knowledge and understanding because, after
all, much of what we know and understand is based on what we have seen.
In (177), for example, the fact that the described party’s failure to consider
a general law of nature can only be reported by Kant if he has had some
direct observation of how they conduct themselves, or more abstractly,
what they believe. And even in (176), in which observation and inference
are expressed, one cannot deny that a sense of knowledge or understanding
is expressed as well. Kant now ‘understands’, after all, that philosophers are
no better than children because of what he has observed. Also, for Goethe
to know that one is supposed to go about one’s own business in (178), he
musthavevisuallyperceivedorbeeninformedofprotocolbeforethespeech
event. And he thus now knows that such action is to be taken. There may
well be multiple readings to these uses of the verb sehen, and thus several
evidential meanings in a single instantiation; I have merely tried to high-
light to most salient reading in each example.
Unlike some cases in the English corpora, the presence or absence of
the dass-complementizer among the German data appears inconsequen-
tial – i.e. there is nothing noteworthy or remarkable about cases where the
complementizer does (not) appear, plus it tends to be present much more
often than in English – and will not be discussed further.

2.2.3  <PV + WH-CC>
SimilartoEnglish see,German sehen inthe<PV+WH-CC>construction
attests a wide array of evidential meaning similar to those found in the <PV
+ FCC> constellation. There is direct visual perception, for example:
(181)	 vndIch,HelenaKottannerinwasauchdabeivndtruegdieJungen

Heiligen Kron, do ward das Gwelb verslossen vnd die tuer an

Helene Kottanerin, Denkwürdigkeiten (1445–1452), S. 10)
	 ‘AndI,HelenaKottannerin,wasalsothereandcarriedtheyoung

how the door was sealed on the vault with many seals where
the holy crown was placed.’

S. 338)
	 ‘Here we see once again how the retina recuperates from a
violent external impression little by little through a succession
of oscillations.’
So in (181), direct vision provides Kottanerin with evidence as to how the
vault was locked and the door was sealed, as it provides Goethe and his
readership with evidence as to how the retina recuperates after a ‘violent
external impression’ (gewaltsamen äußern Eindruck). And although the
wh-word wie ‘how’ lacks the specificity as to the manner of these affairs,
this information is indicated in both these examples by a prepositional
phrase: mit vil sigeln ‘with many seals’ in (181) and durch eine Sukzession
von Schwingungen ‘through a succession of oscillations’ in (182). A more
general sense of observation can also be indicated in the <PV + WH-CC>
construction:

(183)	 Bis hieher haben wir gesehen, wie sich Leibnizens Anhänger

	 ‘UptonowwehaveseenhowthefollowersofLeibnizhavemade
use of the clash of elastic bodies to defend the living forces.’
(184)	 Mit einem gewissen Amüsement sehe ich, wie jetzt die National-

	 ‘I see with a certain amusement how the national liberals –
and free thinkers – now bind bouquets of demands by trades-
men together at their party congresses, out of fear of the next
election.’
But unlike (181) and (182), there is no additional information as tohow the
events observed occur.3 Yet we do know that Kant in (183) and the writer
of the newspaper article in (184) have indeed observed the phenomena
they are describing, and they employ sehen to mark their observation as
evidence for the assertion. And finally, sehen in this construction can also
be a marker of knowledge and understanding:

	 ‘And the Lord testifies so that we see again how this is to be
understood by the visible Catholic Church.’
3	 This has nothing to do with the specific type of evidential meaning being discussed;
it is merely the case with these particular examples.

	 ‘Forgiveme,Mylord,Iseeyousmilingandknowrightwell,that

(191)	 wir sehen die Entzweiung an ihm entstehen, sich fortpflanzen

	 ‘We see the divisiveness emerging in it (iron), propagating itself
and disappearing, and then easily arising anew …’
(192)	 ja indem er es aufnimmt, ist es schon geadelt, und so sehen wir

(Goethe Corpus: Maximen und Reflexionen. Kunst und Kün-
stler (1833), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 12, S. 492)
	 ‘Yes, by his taking it up it is already ennobled, and thus we
see the greatest artists exercising their right to majesty with
boldness.’
The word order is a bit different in (186) – PV + NFV + DO – but this
does not affect the evidential meaning: the speaker still directly perceives
that a large man is standing next to him. In both (187) and (188), Kant’s
evidence for reporting on the perceived situations is direct visual percep-
tion as well; he sees no such star glimmering in the heavens, as well as the
ship drifting downstream. In (189) and (190), direct visual perception of
a singular state or act is more in focus, whereas observation of repeated
or less tangible phenomena are indicated in (191) and (192). In contrast
to English, which employs the present participle to differentiate progres-
sive aspect from the totality or completedness of an event (perfectivity),
German makes no such formal distinction; the aspectual meaning of the
non-finite verb, i.e. the infinitive, can be either, although in (186) through
(192), progressive aspect appears more likely than perfective aspect.4
Of course, even with an infinitive complement, a more general sense
of observation can also be expressed:
4	 This could also be a matter of imperfectivity vs. perfectivity, in which case the infini-
tive complements in (186) through (192) are imperfective, i.e. the events described
are unbounded.
Visual Perception	 99
(193)	 Daher sehen wir bei allen Völkern durch ihre blindeste Vielgöt-
terei doch einige Funken des Monotheismus durchschimmern,
wozu nicht Nachdenken und tiefe Speculation, sondern nur ein
nach und nach verständlich gewordener natürlicher Gang des
gemeinen Verstandes geführt hat. (Kant Corpus: AA III, Kritik
der reinen Vernunft (1787; 2. Aufl.), S. 396)
	 ‘Thus we see with all peoples by their blindest polytheism that
some sparks of monotheism shine through, whereto contem-
plation and deep speculation have not led, but rather only a
gradual understandable course of general understanding.’
(194)	 Wir sehen eine neuerliche Steigerung der Provisionen (um rund
400000M–)undderEinnahmenaufZinsen-undWechselkonto
(um 1 313 000 M –) hervortreten. (DWDS Corpus: (‘Der Auf-
schwung des …’), in: Vossische Zeitung (Morgen-Ausgabe)
(3.3.1912), S. 10)
	 ‘We see a recent increase of provisions (about 400,000M)
and the revenues from interest- and acceptance accounts (at
1,313,000M) emerging.’
Kant observes in (193) how aspects of monotheism manifest themselves in
polytheism, but he is not directly visually perceiving a single event, and see
therefore has more of a sense of observation and consequential inference.
I found one instance where evidential sehen fell within the scope of
the modal verb können, but evidential meaning is still signaled because an
act of perception occurs nonetheless:
(195)	 ‘ganz recht’, versetzte Eduard; ‘einige Schritte von hierkonnte ich
die Leute arbeiten sehen’. (Goethe Corpus: Die Wahlverwandt-
schaften (1809), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 6, S. 242)
	 ‘“Exactly”, replied Eduard; “a few steps from here I could see
the people working”.’
An act of perception occurs here, regardless of the presence of the modal
verb. Eduard has seen the people working indeed, and he merely wishes
to indicate that he was able to do this.
100	 Chapter 2
And sometimes the ‘vision’ indicated by sehen is purely speaker inter-
nal: an internal state or action is being viewed as if it were external. Con-
sider (196):
(196)	 eine solche freundlich-belehrende Unterhaltung ist mir durch
Stiedenroths Psychologie geworden. alle Wirkung des Äußern
aufs Innere trägt er unvergleichlich vor, und wir sehen die Welt
nochmals nach und nach in uns entstehen. (Goethe Corpus:
MaximenundReflexionen.DenkenundTun (1833),Hamburger
Ausgabe, Band 12, S. 403)
	 ‘Suchafriendly,didacticconversationaroseformefromStieden-
roth’s psychology. He incomparably lectures on every effect of
the external on the internal, and we see the world arise in us
again and again.’
This concept of the world arising inside of the speaker is certainly meta-
phorical, yet sehen continues to carry evidential meaning because Goethe
indicates that an internal change is occurring in response to Stiedenroth’s
lectures,andthatsomeunspecifiedsensoryevidenceisproofofthis.Theuse
of sehen metaphorically frames this scenario as a viewable phenomenon. Of
course, Goethe expects he shares this experience with his audience, hence
the use of the plural pronoun wir. Similar to (196) is the use of sehen to
indicate an imagined or yet unfulfilled state, whereby the speaker ‘sees’ a
state or action which has yet to come to pass:
(197)	 ich sehe sie im Geiste schon sitzen und schreiben, und rechnen,
laufen, handeln und trödeln … (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm
Meisters Lehrjahre (1795–1796), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band
7, S. 501)
	 ‘I see them (my children) in my mind already sitting and writ-
ing, and doing arithmetic, running, bargaining and dallying …’
Thespeakerdoesnotclaimthathehasdirectvisualevidenceforhischildren
actually engaging in a variety of activities, but rather that such a scenario
is conceivable. That is, the speaker currently has evidence (internal and
Visual Perception	 101
highly subjective) that these imagined activities are possible and may well
come to pass. They are visually perceivable in the speaker’s mind, and this
is made clear by the addition of im Geiste ‘in (my) mind.’
Of Goethe’s 114 uses of an infinitive complement in the <PV + DO
+ NFV> pattern, thirteen are coupled with haben. These are cases of the
German double infinitive construction. Consider:
(198)	 ich habe ihn soeben zum Seitentor hineinreiten sehen. (Goethe
Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (1795–1796), Hamburger
Ausgabe, Band 7, S. 190)
	 ‘I have just now seen him ride in through the side gate.’
Thoughtherearetwoinfinitives,thesemanticsintheseconstructionsareof
perfectivity. The witnessed action occurred in the recent past and has just
come to a conclusion. Though one might ‘normally’ expect a past partici-
ple, the double infinitive construction is not and has not been unknown
to SP/Ws of German, and it is certainly not limited to the writings of
Goethe. The Goethe Corpus is merely the only place such constructions
were found.
I found one case where an infinitive complement coupled with a per-
ception verb and direct object did not yield an evidential reading, and this
was due to implied conditional semantics:
(199)	 haben wir bisher die entgegengesetzten Farben sich einander
sukzessiv auf der Retina fordern sehen, so bleibt uns noch übrig
zu erfahren, daß diese gesetzliche Forderung auch simultan beste-
hen könne. (Goethe Corpus: Zur Farbenlehre – Didaktischer
Teil (1793), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 13, S. 343)
	 ‘Ifwehavehithertoseentheoppositecolorssuccessivelyproject
themselves on the retina, then it remains for us to experience
that this compulsory demand may also exist simultaneously.’
Whether the colors have or have not been seen remains a question, and
sehen therefore is non-evidential because the writer is only describing the
sceneconditionally.Thatis,therewouldbevisualevidenceiftheproposition
102	 Chapter 2
holds in reality. In contrast to (197) – where the perceptual evidence does
hold in reality, although that for which there is evidence is only an imag-
ined possibility – the evidence itself in (199) is discussed only in possible,
conditional terms: it does not currently exist, whereas the evidence in (197)
does. Due to the conditionality of the evidence’s availability in (199), evi-
dential meaning is absent.
2.2.4.2  Past Participle
When the past participle appears as the non-finite verbal complement
in the <PV + DO + NFV> construction, it can signal a passive sense of
action by obscuring the agent:
(200)	Wir sehen auch diese Theorie in der Praxis hinreichend bestätigt.
(Kant Corpus: AA VIII, Über den Gemeinspruch (1793), S.
303)
	 ‘We even see this theory adequately confirmed in practice.’
(201)	 es ist zwar dies die alte Geschichte, die sich bei Erneuerung und
Belebung starrer stockender Zustände gar oft ereignet hat, und
mag also für ein literarisches Beispiel gelten dessen, was wir in der
politischen und kirchlichen Geschichte so oft wiederholt sehen.
(GoetheCorpus:Tag-undJahreshefte(?),HamburgerAusgabe,
Band 10, S. 442)
	 ‘This is in fact the old story which often came about with the
renewal and recovery of fixed stagnating conditions, and may
also be considered a literary example of that which we see so
often repeated in political and ecclesiastical history.’
(202)	 wir sehen hier das schönste Talent zu ebenso glücklicher Stunde
entwickelt, als es unter ähnlichen Bedingungen und Umständen

	 ‘Weseeherethemostbeautifultalentdevelopedinjustashappy

Visual Perception	 103
Examples (200), (201), and (202) indicate that certain events are being
observed (and are observable), but who exactly is performing these actions
orresponsibleforthemisleftunspecified.Thepastparticiplecanalsosignal
that the current perceived state is the result of previous action:
(203)	 vom Tigris zum Euphrat, vom Euphrat zum Nil sehen wir die
Erde bevölkert … (Goethe Corpus: Dichtung und Wahrheit
(1811–1833), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 9, S. 131)
	 ‘From the Tigris to the Euphrates, from the Euphrates to the
Nile we see the earth populated.’
(204)	den heutigen Tag war jedoch diese Erleuchtung recht am Platze;
denn wir sehen in einem der Zimmer eine Art von Christbe-
scherung aufgestellt, in die Augen fallend und glänzend. (Goethe
Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (1829), Hamburger
Ausgabe, Band 8, S. 201)
	 ‘This enlightenment was, however, today totally appropriate;
for we see in one of the rooms what seems to be a variety of
Christmas gifts arranged, which are shining and attracting
attention.’
(205)	 Als ich eines Tages die Straße betrat, sah ich an der nahen Station
derUntergrundbahneineMenschenmengeversammelt.(DWDS
Corpus:(P.B.),‘DasJahrinParis’,in:BerlinerTageblatt(Abend-
Ausgabe) (3.3.1908), S. 1–3)
	 ‘One day when I entered the street, I saw a crowd of people
assembled at the nearby subway station.’
So in (203), for example, the settlement of the Orient is not what is being
witnessed, but rather the resulting populated state is described ex post facto.
And in (205), the writer here describes a scene concurrent with the percep-
tive act and which is the result of previous action, namely the gathering
of people near the subway station. There is one instance in the Goethe
Corpus similar to (197), where the vision occurs only in the imagination
of the speaker:
104	 Chapter 2
(206)	ich versprach ihm alles mögliche Stillschweigen, und sah schon
im Geist den Titel meiner Piece an den Ecken der Straßen und
Plätze mit großen Buchstaben angeschlagen. (Goethe Corpus:
DichtungundWahrheit(1811–1833),HamburgerAusgabe,Band
9, S. 108)
	 ‘Ipromisedhimallpossiblesilence,andalready saw inmymind
the title of my piece on street corners and other squares posted
in big letters.’
The resultant sense of the scene is maintained because the posting of the
author’s title has already occurred, but this entire scene does not play out
in the external world, but rather in the world of SP/W imagination. And
again, the presence of the phrase im Geist ‘in (my) mind’ makes this clear.
But here as well as in the more ‘real’ world events, vision – albeit imaginary
to a degree – provides the speaker’s evidence in asserting that this action
has already happened at the moment of utterance.
Finally, the past participle complement is able to indicate an internal
emotive or intellectual state of the SP/W without any direct indication
of visual perception.
(207)	Jch sihe mich aber an dieser Rache verhindert / durch diesen
Moenchen / der mit mir sich weder schlagen noch vertragen will.
(Bonner Corpus: Text 137, Sigmund von Birken, Spiegel der
Ehren des Erzhauses Oesterreich (1668), S. 70A)
	 ‘I see myself hindered in this vengeance by this monk who
neither wants to fight nor reconcile himself with me.’
(208)	 Ich sehe mich durch meinen Zweck nach Gesetzen der Freiheit
genöthigt, ein höchstes Gut in der Welt als möglich anzunehmen,
aberichkannkeinenAnderndurchGründenöthigen(derGlaube

	 ‘I see myself compelled by my intended purpose according to
the laws of freedom to accept as possible a highest good in the
world, but I cannot compel anyone else by any means (belief
is free).’
Visual Perception	 105
(209)	 … und je lebendiger irgend ein Wissen in uns wird, desto mehr

	 ‘… and the more lively any knowledge becomes in us, the more
weseeourselvescompelledtopursueitupwardsanddownwards

(210)	 als ich den übrigen nachzueilen rannte, fand ich die Leiter schon

	 ‘When I ran to catch up to the others, I found that the ladder
had already been lifted up and saw all hope of saving myself
entirely barred.’
(211)	 Ich sah mich veranlaßt, sie hervorzutreten … (DWDS Corpus:
1902)5
	 ‘I saw myself forced to bring them forth.’
Unlike most other cases of a past participle complement thus far, however,
the agent of the action – the monk who is hindering the speaker – is indi-
cated in (207). And the speaker cites his own belief here as the evidence,
for sihe does not indicate visual perception. Kant similarly cites an internal
state as the reason he is compelled to engage in action in (208). In a sense,
sehen here has more a sense of fühlen (see Chapter 4) because it signals
some sort of emotive perception, although there is still a sense of mental
perception: Kant mentally ‘sees’ himself being compelled to accept ein
höchstes Gut ‘a highest good’. This use is quite frequent with Kant, in fact.
Of the 16 cases of the <PV + DO + NFV> taking a past participle, seven
havegenötigt‘compelled’astheverbalcomplement,while gedrungen ‘urged,
compelled’ is used twice. So over half of Kant’s uses of the past participle

106	 Chapter 2
with evidentialsehen are for the purpose of reflecting on an internal mental
and/or emotive state that drives him to certain actions or conclusions. That
is, visual perception or general observation does not provide the evidence
here; the evidential source lies rather in belief or feeling.
2.2.5  <PV + ADJ>
I found one peculiar instance in the Kant Corpus ofsehen taking an adjec-
tival complement. This is particularly odd because only object-oriented
perceptionverbstendtotakeadjectivesascomplements.However,thiscase
is very similar to the internal mental or emotive use of the past participle
discussed above and exhibited by (207) through (211). Here, Kant reflects
on an internal state, although this state is not exclusive to himself because
he uses the plural pronoun wir:
(212)	 DadurchsehenwirunsindengeheimstenBeweggründenabhängig
von der Regel des allgemeinen Willens, und es entspringt daraus
in der Welt aller denkenden Naturen eine moralische Einheit
und systematische Verfassung nach bloß geistigen Gesetzen. (Kant
Corpus: AA II, Träume eines Geistersehers (1766), S. 335)
	 ‘Thusweseeourselvesinthemostsecretmotivationsdependent
on the rule of the general will, and a moral unity and systematic
constitution according to mere spiritual laws arises from this
in the world of all thinking beings.’
The perceived state here is dependency, and Kant employs the percep-
tion verb sehen to signal that he considers himself to be in this state, and
because Kant probably assumes his readers will share his perceptions, he
uses wir instead of ich.
Visual Perception	 107
2.2.6  <PARENTH>
When used parenthetically, evidential sehen is capable of expressing literal
vision and observation:
(213)	 und die ellenlangen Zeitungen da liegen vor mir auf dem Tische,
es stehen Nachrichten darin aus der ganzen Welt, wie ich sehe,
und ich weiß nicht, was sie bringen. (Goethe Corpus: Zweiter
römischer Aufenthalt (1786–1788), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band
11, S. 424)
	 ‘And those long newspapers lie there on the table before me;
there is news in there from all over the world, as I see, and I
don’t know what they bring.’
(214)	 ‘was aber fangen wir mit Felix an?’ fragte Makarie, ‘welcher,
wie ich sehe, mit der Betrachtung jener Bilder schon fertig ist
und einige Ungeduld merken läßt’. (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm
Meisters Wanderjahre (1829), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 8, S.
117)
	 ‘“But what are we going to do with Felix?”, asked Makarie,
“who, as I see, has already finished observing those pictures
and is showing some impatience”.’
(215)	 Löbell – wiederholt; Ich – halte diese Aktennotiz im vollsten
Umfange–aufrechtundweisedenunerhörtenVorwurf–,denSie

wieichsehe,heutewiederholen,mitderallergrößtenEntschieden-
heitzurück.(DWDSCorpus:‘DeutscherReichstag’,in:Berliner
Tageblatt (Morgen-Ausgabe) (5.3.1907), S. 20–1)
	 ‘Löbell repeats; I stick to what’s in this memo and refute most
emphatically the outrageous allegation, which you made (to
Erzberger) on Saturday and which you, as I see, repeat again
today most decisively.’
In (213), visual observation via reading is what provides the evidence for
asserting that news from all over the world can be found in the newspapers,
while the same visual evidence through the observation of Felix’s behavior
108	 Chapter 2
provide the basis in (214) of Makarie’s assertion that Felix is no longer
looking at the pictures and becoming impatient.
Parenthetical sehen is more likely, however, to indicate an internal
belief or intellectual state of the SP/W:
(216)	 EswäreeinäußerstfatalerStreich,wenn(wiedochaufpreußischen
Posten nicht zu erwarten ist) der Brief gar verloren gegangen seyn
sollte; da wie ich sehe Hr. P. K. keine Abschrift davon behalten.

	 ‘It would be an extremely fatal blow if (as is not to be expected
from the Prussian post offices, however) the letter should have
gotten lost; for as I see it, Mr P. K. has kept no copy of it.’
(217)	 So viel ich sehe gebrauchen Sie in der Crit. d. R. V. den Ausdruck

	 ‘As I see it, you understand the expression “recognition” in
the Critique of Practical Reason in a double sense, once that it

that ways of viewing and conceptualizing are of the same kind

see, for the insights of the former are intuitive, while those of
the latter are, on the other hand, only discursive realizations.’

	 ‘My words were not, as far as I see, the first words disclosed in
the newspaper report.’
In (216) and (217), sehen appears to indicate some sort of combination of
understanding and belief. Kant assesses the described situation in terms
of his own (internal) perception of what is going on. So in (216), Kant
asserts that, as far as he knows or understands the current state of affairs,
he believes that Mr P. K. has not kept a copy of the letter about to be sent.
In (218), however, the focus is a bit different: instead of using sehen to
express belief, Kant instead uses this perception verb to signal a conclu-
sion based on explicitly mentioned facts (i.e. the nature of mathematics
and philosophy). The conclusion is no doubt subjective, but it is marked
in relation to explicitly mentioned ‘objective’ facts, and it is not as tenta-
tive as the beliefs expressed in (216) and (217). And in (219), the events
cannot be visually perceived, but they can be metaphorically expressed as
a form of internal, mental ‘vision’, and that is exactly what Goethe is doing
with evidential sehen. The writer in (220) indicates that the extent of his
knowledge allows him to make the assertion that his first words were not
disclosed in the press. But as has been the case with all such previous exam-
ples, some form of vision or observation must have occurred in the past
for the writer to arrive at such a conclusion. As we see, visual perception
often underlies several metaphorical and non-metaphorical extensions of
sehen’s root meaning, which is also the case with English see.
I also found a few instances where sehen is used in an anaphoric sense
of referring to previous discourse content:
110	 Chapter 2
(221)	 da uns nun zu mancherlei Gebrauch ein reinliches Weiß höchst
nötig und angenehm ist, wie wir uns besonders gern der leinenen
undbaumwollenenZeugeungefärbtbedienen,auchseideneZeuge,
das Papier und anderes uns desto angenehmer sind, je weißer sie
gefunden werden, weil auch ferner, wie wir oben gesehen, das
Hauptfundament der ganzen Färberei weiße Unterlagen sind …
(Goethe Corpus: Zur Farbenlehre – Didaktischer Teil (1793),
Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 13, S. 456)
	 ‘Becausenowapurewhiteisextremelynecessaryandpleasantto
us in various uses, as we especially like to use undyed linen and
cotton products, and also silk products, paper and other things
are therefore more pleasant, the more white they can be found
because furthermore, as we saw above, the primary foundation
of the entire dye works is the white raw material …’
Here, Goethe employs the parenthetical construction anaphorically to
point back to previous material as evidence for the current assertion, i.e.
the primacy of white materials when working with dyes. This is not a case
of an <EXT> evidential, however, for sehen – although not part of the
syntactic structure it takes scope over – is integrated nonetheless into its
structurebecauseit‘interrupts’theflowofthesentence,whereasan<EXT>
construction occurs outside the clause altogether.
And similar to parenthetical English see and the presence of the con-
junction as, the appearance of the conjunction wie alongside parentheti-
cal sehen produces the same intersubjective effect: the evidence, whether
perceived literally or metaphorically, is left open to a larger speech com-
munity for alternative interpretations. In (217), for instance, Kant indicates
how he perceives the reader of his letter to have interpreted his Critique
of Practical Reason, but also implicitly acknowledges that the addressee
may well have interpreted it differently. In (218), on the other hand, Kant
acknowledges he shares this evidence with others by using the pronoun
wir, but he also assumes that his those with whom he shares the evidence
also share his conclusions.

	 ‘“She is healthy and happy.” Yes, I saw that when you paddled
by.’
All three cases in the Kant Corpus of sehen in an <EXT> construction
involve observation combined with direct visual perception, although
in (224), the observation is more indirect. After all, the manifestation of
love towards parents and children is something that can only be witnessed
indirectly, i.e. through observing behaviors that manifest love, for human
emotions themselves are not physically tangible. In (225), Goethe com-
ments on the artist Raffael’s work and comments that this work was done
perothers’specifieddesires.Hisbasisforthisassertionisdirectobservation
of Raffael’s work, particularly The Ecstasy of St. Cecilia (‘Cäcilia’). Likewise
in (226), where observation of a geistiger … Verknüpfung ‘spiritual combi-
nation’ serves as evidence for asserting the comment about what supports
life. Punctuation contributes to the <EXT> function of sehen because the
Visual Perception	 113
colon separates the clause with the evidential perception verb from the
clause (or proposition) over which it has scope in examples (223) through
(225). And in (227), there is an additional inferential meaning because the
speaker has visually observed and subsequently inferred that the woman
accompanyingtheaddresseeisgesundundmunter‘healthyandjolly’,andhis
inference is then confirmed by the addressee. Visual perception is involved
here indeed (through the viewing of the woman), but so is inference, for
one cannot visually perceive the state of someone’s health, but merely infer
based on physical appearance and behavior.
2.2.8  Summary of sehen
The evidential uses of German sehen are remarkably similar to those of
English see. The same three complementation patterns – <PV + FCC>,
<PV + WH-CC>, and <PV + DO + NFV> – as well as the parenthetical
(<PARENTH>)andexternalevidentialmarker(<EXT>)usesoccurwith
bothverbsatcomparativefrequencies.Theonlystrikingdifferencebetween
English and German is that, because German does not employ the present
participle verbally, any aspectual differences (perfective versus progressive
and/or imperfective) made in <PV + DO + NFV> constructions with the
infinitive are not formally indicated and are to be garnered from context.
Thesedifferencesaside,theevidentialmeaningsexpressedbyGerman sehen
are the same as those found in Englishsee. In the <PV + FCC> pattern, for
example, one is able to find direct visual perception, general observation
and possible subsequent inference, as well as knowledge or understand-
ing form the basis of the evidential meaning. These differences are purely
context-dependent; that is, one must examine the semantics of the evi-
dentialized proposition to see exactly what type of evidential meaning the
SP/W is wishing to convey. When internal states or desires are expressed,
for example, one can pretty much exclude direct visual perception as a pos-
sible evidential meaning. Rather, inference or understanding are the more
likely candidates for types of evidential meaning. The case is similar with
the <PV + WH-CC> complementation pattern. Regarding <PV + DO
+ NFV>, the taking of an infinitive complement generally means that the
114	 Chapter 2
content of the proposition is visually perceived directly or being observed
or witnessed over a period of time. The past participle, on the other hand,
either obscures or deemphasizes the agent of action, or it presents a current
state which is the result of previous action or event. The parentheticals,
like the Type I complementation pattern, can signal either external visual
perception or internal cognitive or emotive perception, depending on
context. And regarding the external markers of evidentiality, visual percep-
tion and observation or witnessing are most often the evidential meanings
expressed. So similar to English see, German employs evidential sehen to
signal external perceptual evidence and internal intellectual evidence, and
both types of evidence appear equally prominent.
2.3  look
2.3.1  Quantitative Results
We now turn our attention to the object-oriented perception verb look
and its evidential uses in the English corpora. In the Helsinki Corpus,
look appears a total of 291 times, and eleven (3.8%) of these instances attest
evidential meaning. There are several more attestations in the ARCHER
Corpus (a total of 1,648), and 145 (8.8%) of these are evidential. Table 3
presents us with the exact breakdown of complementation patterns.
We can see here that object-oriented perception verbs prefer construc-
tion Types IV, V, VI, and VII, whereas subject-oriented perception verbs
occur in Types I, II, III, VIII, and IX. The occurrence of evidential look is
most prevalent with an adjectival or adverbial complement, although look
also occurs often with a clause introduced by some sort of conjunction.
Nominal and prepositional complements are also to be found here, gener-
ally with lesser frequences.

2.3.2  <PV + PPlike>
When evidential look is coupled with a prepositional phrase headed by
like, it can signal that the SP/W infers – based on visual evidence – that
the object of like is coreferential with the grammatical subject of the entire
clause, i.e. the object of perception. For example:
(228)	 … the town looks like a thriveing place by the substantiall houses,
well pitched streetes which are broad enough for two Coaches to
go a breast, besides a pitch’d walke on either side by the houses …
(Helsinki Corpus: CETRAV3A, Celia Fiennes, The Journeys
of Celia Fiennes (1640–1710), p. 142)
(229)	 Perhaps this is the lady who wrote to Henry, she looks like a
woman of quality, if I may judge from her dress. I’ll ask her. –
You wish to leave this country, lovely Moor? (ARCHER Corpus:
1794rows.d4a, Susanna Rowson, Slaves in Algiers or a Struggle
for Freedom)
(230)	 Well, Thomas, why? Make me understand – because I’ll tell you
now, from where I stand, this looks like cowardice! (ARCHER
Corpus: 1960bolt.d8b, Robert Bolt, A Man for All Seasons)
116	 Chapter 2
In (228), the overall appearance of the town causes the speaker to infer that
the town is a ‘thriveing place’, while the lady’s apparel in (229) provides the
speaker with evidence to infer that this lady is a ‘woman of quality’. The case
is a bit different in (230) because cowardice obviously cannot be visually
perceived. Instead, actions of cowardice are observable, and the speaker
here infers from Thomas’ actions that Thomas is a coward. There are no
singular entities that can be perceived, as there are in (228) and (229), to
provide the basis of evidence; instead, generally observable phenomena –
Thomas’ deeds – provide the basis of inference in (230).
It must be made clear that not all instances of the <PV + PPlike> con-
struction are carriers of evidential meaning. Sometimes a mere compari-
son is made without regard to any sort of visual evidence, as is the case in
(231):
(231)	 But methinks, the Seat of our Family looks like (^Noah’s^) Ark,
as if the chief part on’t were design’d for the Fowls of the Air, and
the Beasts of the Field. (Helsinki Corpus: CEPLAY3A, John
Vanbrugh, The Relapse (1640–1710), p. I,57)
Clearly the family seat cannot be Noah’s Ark, nor does the speaker infer
(based on visual evidence) that this is the case. The speaker here merely sees
a resemblance to Noah’s Ark based on visually perceivable attributes of the
family seat, but he in no way intends to indicate that the physical appear-
ance of the family seat is a reason for inferring that the seat is none other
than Noah’s Ark. Evidential meaning is absent here, and such instances do
not appear in the tabulations of Table 3.
2.3.3  <PV + ADJ>
This construction is the best attested complementation pattern of eviden-
tial look and allows speakers to express an inference about some state or
attribute of the object of visual perception:
Visual Perception	 117
(232)	 And trust me, I was comming to you: you looke very ill. (Helsinki
Corpus: CEPLAY2A, William Shakespeare, The Merry Wives
of Windsor (1602), p. 43.C2)
(233)	 He is in perfect good Health, an looks extreamly well. (ARCHER
Corpus: 1715eve1.n3b, The Evening Post)
(234)	 The young men, their Assistants, looked very eager, and cast fre-
quent glances of awe upon so distinguished a practitioner as the
venerable Cuticle. (ARCHER Corpus: 1850mlvl.f6a, Herman
Melville, White-Jacket)
(235)	 An hour or so later when I was sitting on the back verandah, sip-
ping a gin and tonic and feeling as if I had been run over, Robin
appeared looking cheerful … (ARCHER Corpus: 1960cowa.
f8b, Noel Coward, Pomp and Circumstance)
Things such as illness, eagerness, or cheerfulness are obviously incapable
of being seen, but their existence can be inferred from visual cues. One’s
demeanor can be indicative of one’s mood, as it can be of one’s health.
Thus in (233), the man’s physical appearance is viewed as an index of the
man’s physical wellness: in this case he is deemed to be healthy because he
‘looks … well’. Many cases of this complementation pattern involve the use
of well as an adjectival complement, and health status is always the object
of inference (with regard to visual perception).
Sometimes the adjectival complement is actually a participle, and here
the verbal sense is not totally absent from the scene in question:
(236)	 We were obliged to double-reef the topsails as soon as we hauled to
the wind, and the weather looked very threatening. (ARCHER
Corpus:1836marr.f5b,CaptainFrederickMarryat, PeterSimple,
In The Complete Works of Captain Marryat, vol. 1, Leipzig: Fre-
derick Fleischer, pp. 135–50)
(237)	 She looked for a moment almost offended; it was the natural
instinctive method of defence. (ARCHER Corpus: 1886giss.f6b,
George Gissing, Isabel Clarendon)
118	 Chapter 2
(238)	 Dottie’s cryptic expression changed and she looked delighted.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1951marq.f8a, John Phillips Marquand,
Melville Goodwin, USA)
In (236), the present participle is used to indicate the on-going threat of
inclement weather, while in (237) and (238), the past participle conveys not
only a passive sense of action, but also a resultant state of being: on the one
hand, the agent of offence in (237) or delight in (238) is left syntactically
unexpressed, and at the same time, this previous action leaves the object
of perception in a currently perceived state. Hence the act of delighting
has left Dottie in an apparent state of delight in (238). There are two such
uses of adjectival participles in the Helsinki Corpus and twenty-one in
the ARCHER Corpus.
In previous discussions of negation as it relates to the subject-oriented
see and sehen, it was argued that negation does away with any possible
evidential meaning because negated evidence implies no evidence. And
no evidence means no evidential meaning. The tendency is different with
object-oriented perception verbs, for here, negation contributes to the
evidential meaning expressed by look. Consider the following two cases
from the ARCHER Corpus:
(239)	 You observed, yourself, you know, that Hester did not look well;
and indeed the few weeks after your accident were so trying to
her, – the exertions she made to conceal her feelings were so ...
But I must spare her delicacy. (ARCHER Corpus: 1836marr.
f5b, Captain Frederick Marryat, Peter Simple, In The Complete
Works of Captain Marryat, vol. 1, Leipzig: Frederick Fleischer,
pp. 135–50)
(240)	Yes, Child, I’ve been in twenty Places buying Pennyworths
<Penn’worths> this Morning: but methinks you don’t look well,
Miss Bell, what’s the matter with you? (ARCHER Corpus:
1730mott.d3b, John Mottley, The Widow Bewitch’d)
Negation does not indicate that no perceptual act occurred at all (as is
often signified by not + see), but rather, the speakers judge Hester’s and
Visual Perception	 119
Miss Bell’s appearances and demeanor and conclude that they are in poor
health. Whereas the evidence drives the speaker to conclude positively
about the object of perception’s health in (233), (239) and (240) show
how the speaker can also infer that the perceived object is in bad health.
So as far as object-oriented perception verbs are concerned, negation does
not cancel out any evidence; it merely alters the consequential inference
resulting from the perceptual act.
When look is used only to denote some sort of value judgment on the
part of the speaker, evidential meaning is absent. The speaker only makes a
comment about some sort of physically tangible attribute of the perceived
object but does not use perception as a basis for inference:
(241)	 The day was fine, and the grounds looked very pretty. (ARCHER
Corpus: 1805knig.j5b, Ellis Knight, The Autobiography of Miss
Knight: Lady Companion to Princess Charlotte, ed. Roger Ful-
ford, London: Kimber, 1960)
Thewriterherefindsthegroundsvisuallypleasingandthusnoteshisdelight
with the object-oriented perception verb; he does not, however, draw any
sort of conclusion or inference from what he perceives, and (241) is thus
void of evidential meaning. The same can be said when look is used to
describe physical characteristics:
(242)	You will go before me though, I shall wear weeds for my love –
your facelooksthis instant pale as marble… (ARCHER Corpus:
1785macn.d4b, Leonard MacNally, Fashionable Levities)
A face can physically appear flushed and pale, and look in (242) thus does
not provide evidence for any sort of inference or conclusion; it merely is
used to state a tangible fact about someone’s physical appearance.
120	 Chapter 2
2.3.4 <PV + CONJ + C>
When evidential look is coupled with a clause that is not introduced by the
that-complementizerbutratherwithsomeotherconjunction(thatdoesnot
introduce a complementizer clause), it indicates that visual evidence exists
that points to a possible or hypothetical state of affairs. One finds like used
as a conjunction, but the phrasal conjunctions as if and as though are used
more often. With the latter, it is not uncommon to find irrealis semantics
attached to the verb of the evidentialized clause. Hence we find:
(243)	 You confess’d you were forc’d to bilk your Coach, to get rid of the
Coxcombs, that dog’d you from the Play-House, and being pursu’d
by the Coachman, and Footmen (for I don’t doubt but you gave
the Gentlemen encouragement enough, to come home with you)
you looked <lookt> as if you belong’d to a Cellar, in some of the
Allies you were hunted through, and had been caterwawling in
all the kennels in Town. (ARCHER Corpus: 1692soth.d2b,
Thomas Southerne, The Wives Excuse or Cuckolds Make)
(244)	But I protest you look as if you had been in tears! you are mel-
ancholy, my dear. (ARCHER Corpus: 1796sarg.d4a, Judith
Sargent Murray, The Gleaner, vol. III)
(245)	 Therefugeesfromtheterrorlookedasthoughtheyhadbeentramp-
ingthroughthenight.(ARCHERCorpus:1930toml.f7b,Major
Henry Tomilson, All Our Yesterdays)
In (244), for example, the speaker – thanks to visual evidence – infers that
the addresse was very likely in tears, or at least that this scenario was pos-
sible. The same is true of (245): based on the physical appearance of the
refugees, it is very likely that they ‘have been tramping through the night’.
If they have not been doing this, then the visual evidence at least points
out that this was a possible playing out of events in the past. It thus makes
perfect sense why irrealis meaning is present here. Because the speaker
cannot say for certain the event x or y occurred in the past, but only that
current visually perceivable conditions make this possible, s/he refuses to
Visual Perception	 121
assert for certain what has happened, but rather points to a possible or
likely scenario inferred from very real visual evidence.
It is not uncommon to find non-raised look in this construction, i.e.
the impersonal, ‘dummy’ subject it precedes look in the matrix clause. In
fact, nearly half (seventeen, 43.6%) of the cases of look appearing in the
<PV + CONJ + C> pattern are not raising constructions. And this is the
only place where like functions as a conjunction (a total of five instances
were found). Consider:
(246)	It looks as if there had been a violent storm and it had froze the
waves, just as they were justling <sic> and beating against one
another, and the billows and foam and white froth were grown
stiff just as they were at the height of their hurry. (ARCHER
Corpus: 1716ryde.j3b, Sir Dudley Ryder, The Diary of Dudley
Ryder, 1715–1716, ed. W. Matthews, London: Methuen & Co.,
1939)
(247)	IT begins to look as though our Western civilisation were rapidly
retrograding to the old days, when the whole population of the
border was divided into hostile camps of rogues and regulators.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1872gla2.n6b, Glasgow Sentinel)
(248)	Arose and tried to shave with a razor so dull that every time I
scraped my face itlooked as if I was in the throes of cholera morbus.
(ARCHERCorpus:1885edis.j6a,ThomasA.Edison,TheDiary
and Sundry Observations of Thomas Alva Edison, ed. Dagobert
A. Runes, New York: Philosophical Library, 1948)
(249)	Well, Lulu, it looks like you’re settled here. (ARCHER Corpus:
1954park.d8a, Dorothy Parker and Arnaud d’Usseau,Ladies of
the Corridor)
Inference from vision and observation are indicated by these construc-
tions, as it is in the raised counterparts. It has often been argued that,
because raised constructions are supposedly more subjective, sentences
(246) through (249) are more intersubjective because they are not raised
(Nuyts 2001: 270, 307; Verhagen 2005: 133–4; cf. Langacker 1999): we
would hence expect the evidence indicated here to be available to a larger
122	 Chapter 2
speech community and not exclusively to the SP/Ws. However, there is no
clear indication – linguistic or otherwise – that the evidence is available
to anyone but the SP/Ws in the above cases. Nor is it clear that the SP/Ws
are attempting to engage their audience with the evidence by bringing it to
their attention for the first time, or expecting their audience to share the
same inferences. The inference that Lulu is ‘settled here’ in (249) is made
by the speaker alone, and there is no indication in this sentence itself, or in
the larger discourse context, that anyone besides the speaker has made or
can make a similar inference based on evidence shared by a larger speech
community. Therefore, at least as far as evidential uses of object-oriented
perception verbs are concerned, it cannot be said that raising or non-raising
affects the degree of (inter)subjectivity indicated by SP/Ws.
There was one instance where the visual evidence is made tentative
by the adverb almost:
(250)	 It almost looks as though the Stockton and Darlington Railway
was, in its early years, a Pease proprietary article! (ARCHER
Corpus: 1827whit.j5b, Thomas Whitwell, ‘A Darlington’,Jour-
nal of the Friends Historical Society 24)
The writer here doesn’t wish to fully commit to stating that he has inferred
about the origins of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, but he does
feel that the evidence he has may bear relevance to the discourse context.
He openly leaves it to the possibility of being falsified without negating it
completely. In other words, he believes his inference may well be correct,
but leaves the possibility open that he is in error.
Finally, there were a few instances where a grammatical subject was
altogether absent, but I interpreted these as non-raised constructions as
well because no grammatical subject besides the impersonal it would be
plausible:
(251)	 LookslikethisBishop’svisitisgoin’tobeacurseinsteadofablessin’!
(ARCHER Corpus: 1955ocsy.d8b, Sean O’Casey, The Bishop’s
Bonfire)
Visual Perception	 123
Much as with (246) through (249), observation leads to the inference that
the Bishop’s visit is not going to have positive consequences.
2.3.5  <PV + {IC + ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}>
This construction type is the least attested of all types taken by evidential
look, and – if the dates of the ARCHER Corpus are any reliable indica-
tion – a recent historical development. There is one attestation from the
eighteenth century, and the rest are from the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. In the majority of cases, the infinitive copula is elided:
(252)	 I was extremely struck with the sight. It is all froze over, but by
the snow and the tide, which has broke the ice and heaped it one
upon another, it looks the most wild and confused sight I ever
saw. (ARCHER Corpus: 1716ryde.j3b, Sir Dudley Ryder, The

iceberg in the distance. It looked, through the glass, to be about 30
feet long and 50 or 60 feet high. (ARCHER Corpus: 1850low-.
j6a, Garrett W. Low, Gold Rush by the Sea, ed. Kenneth Haney,
Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1941)
Much as with other complementation patterns taken by evidential look,
this one allows SP/Ws to indicate that they have visual evidence driving
them to infer about the specificity of a certain object under observation.
In (254), for example, observation allows the writer to infer the size of the
iceberg. Interestingly, the earliest attestations of this type have an elided
copula; only two of the eight attestations (example (254) and one from the
year 1917) contain the infinitive copula. One might historically expect the
124	 Chapter 2
opposite, but this is not what the data show. There are too few attestations
to make any definite conclusions, but it is interesting to note that this is
the only complementation pattern that appears rather late; all other pat-
terns can be found at or near the beginning of the Early Modern period of
English, which probably means they were in use even earlier.6
2.3.6  Summary of look
Evidential look, regardless of what complementation pattern it occurs in,
fails to display the degree of polysemy attested by its subject-oriented coun-
terpart see. All cases of look involve direct visual perception as evidence, or
at least general observation of behavior, leading to subsequent inference.
Several complementation patterns, especially <PV + PPlike> or <PV +
ADJ>, are not solely limited to expressing evidential meaning. That is,
constructions of this sort are also capable of allowing the SP/W to denote
othertypesofmeaningsuchascomparisonandvaluejudgments.Purported
colorings of intersubjective meaning were not found in the non-raised
constructions of the <PV + CONJ + C> type. And some constructions
appear to have developed more recently, as can been seen with the <PV
+ {IC + ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}> complementation pattern.
See, on the other hand, appears to have been displaying a wide variety of
evidential meanings throughout the (Early) Modern Period of English.
Look has only taken on evidential meaning in certain complementation
patterns more recently.
6	 One could make an exception here for the non-raised constructions of the <PV +
CONJ + C> complementation pattern. They are also first attested in the eighteenth
century.

2.4.1  Quantitative Results
The German aussehen does not enjoy the same degree of frequency or
polysemy of evidential meaning when compared with its subject-oriented
counterpart sehen. In the Bonner Corpus, there are a mere seven instantia-
tions ofaussehen, and two (28.6%) exhibit evidential meaning. Twenty-one
cases of this verb were found in the Kant Corpus, and evidentiality was
expressed in only three (11.1%) examples. There are a total of 179 occur-
rences of aussehen in the Goethe Corpus, twenty-five (14%) enjoying use
as evidential markers. Finally, in the DWDS Corpus, 468 cases ofaussehen
were found, and sixty-six (14.1%) of these cases attest evidential meaning.
Although there are not nearly as many cases of evidential aussehen than
there are of sehen, the former appears (statistically speaking) to be used
evidentially a greater percentage of the time than the latter. This is not the
case withtheEnglish look,whoseevidentialuses appear atroughlythe same
rate as those of subject-oriented see. The breakdown of complementation
patterns can be found in Table 4.
7	 Aussehen is a combination of the verbal particle aus + the perception verb sehen. For
the German data, only cases of the verbal particles that are relevant to the discussion
of evidential meaning, i.e. cases of aussehen and anhören ‘to sound’ (when used with
reflexive pronoun sich), are counted, and their count is separate from the rootssehen
(Section 2.2) and hören (Section 3.2). Consequently, other instances of perception
verbs occurring with verbal particles not treated in the discussion here, e.g. an- in
ansehen ‘to observe, look at’, are excluded from any numeric counts included in this
discussion.

With the exception of the DWDS Corpus, complementation pattern V
is the preferred construction type in the corpora. There are also a healthy
number of Type VI constructions, and these are in fact preferred in the
DWDS Corpus. Unlike English, which has a fair number of Type IV com-
plementation patterns for evidential look, I found only one such instance
for aussehen in the DWDS Corpus. And German completely lacks con-
struction Type VII, which enjoys some – albeit a small amount of – usage
among English language evidential perception verbs.
2.4.2  <PV + PPnach>
There is only one attestation of evidential aussehen in all the corpora exam-
ined, and it comes from the DWDS Corpus:
(255)	 Die Ausgaben mußten reduziert werden, und Provianthäuser
und andere Anlagen wurden aufgehoben. Alles sah nach tiefstem
Frieden aus. Nur Butler war sich über die Lage klar – derselbe,
dem man später vorwarf, er habe es unterlassen, die Regierung
vor der bevorstehenden Gefahr zu warnen. (DWDS Corpus:
‘Das Vorspiel des Burenkrieges’, in:Berliner Tageblatt(Morgen-
Ausgabe) 4.3.1911, S. 1–2)
Visual Perception	 127
	 ‘The expenditures had to be reduced, and the houses used to
store provisions and other facilities were closed. Everything
looked like the most profound peace. Only Butler was sure
about the situation – the same one who was later accused
of neglecting to warn the administration about the existing
danger.’
The meaning of aussehen here is clearly not focused on a single entity, but
rather on an overall situation. Thus there is only observation of general
happenings, for peace is nothing that is visible to the human eye. Only the
perception of a larger situation can lead one to infer that this situation is
peaceful. Of course, things were not as they appeared to be because Butler
‘war sich über die Lage klar’, but at the time of perception, things appeared
to be quite peaceful.
2.4.3  <PV + ADJ>
The corpora provided several more instances of this complementation
pattern than that involving a prepositional phrase introduced by nach.
Here aussehen behaves much like its English counterpart look, indicating
the SP/W’s use of visual evidence to infer about a state or disposition of
the perceived object, person, or situation:
(256)	 Justitia sahe sawer auß vnd achtete keines Mänschen. (Bonner
Corpus: Text 237, Hans Michael Moscherosch, Gesichte Phi-
landers von Sittewald (1650), S. 23)
	 ‘Justitia looked peeved and didn’t regard anyone.’
(257)	 Der Cholerische sieht trotzig aus. Also ist seine Freundlichkeit
ceremoniös und verstellt. (Kant Corpus: AA XV, Reflexionen

	 ‘The choleric man looks defiant. Thus his friendliness is cer-
emonious and feigned.’
(258)	 der älteste Junge lief mir entgegen, sein Freudengeschrei führte
die Mutter herbei, die sehr niedergeschlagen aussah. (Goethe
128	 Chapter 2
Corpus: Die Leiden des jungen Werther (1774), Hamburger
Ausgabe, Band 6, S. 76)
	 ‘The oldest boy ran to meet me, his cries of joy brought the
mother over, who looked very disheartened.’
(259)	 Dr. Zeigner – sieht krank aus, seine Augen sind tief umschattet,
seinHaaristandenSchläfenstarkergraut.SeineGesichtsfarbeist
gelb;Möbiushateinfrisches,ordinäresGesicht.(DWDSCorpus:
‘Ministerpräsident Zeigner vor Gericht’, in: Vossische Zeitung
(Abend-Ausgabe) 14.3.1924, S. 4)
	 ‘Dr Zeigner looks sick, his eyes are deeply shadowed, his hair
is extremely grayed on his temple. His face is yellow; Möbius
has a fresh, plain face.’
The objects of perception in (256) through (259), usually betrayed by their
facial expressions, provide the SP/W with visual evidence to infer about a
certain state of affairs. So in (259), Dr Zeigner’s physical appearance leads
the writer to infer that he is sick, and the specific physical symptoms are
then specified. Sometimes conclusions are drawn based on what is inferred,
as is the case in (257): based on the choleric man’s seemingly sullen looks,
Kant infers that this man’s behavior is feigned and insincere. Things are a
bit different in (258), where the adjective is also a past participle (niederge-
schlagen ‘disheartened’). The same principle of inference applies here, but
the actual cause, i.e. the agent(s) of the disheartening, is left unspecified
(we later learn that the mother has lost her youngest servant and that her
husband has returned unsuccessful from a business venture in Switzer-
land, and he is also sick with the fever). Sometimes a more general sense
of observation is involved, where the actual attribute in question is not
perceivable, but rather, externally perceivable states or actions provide the
grounds for inference:
(260)	Das Künstlerpaar, der Bursch und das Mädel, sahen höchst ver-
dächtig aus. (DWDS Corpus: 1922)
	 ‘The pair of artists, the boy and the girl, looked extremely
suspicious.’
Visual Perception	 129
Here, the behavior of the boy and the girl who accompanies him leads
the speaker to infer that their actions are suspicious in nature. This is a bit
more subjective than examples (256) through (259) because here not only
is the inference signaled by aussehen a subjective act, but the value judg-
ment indicated by verdächtig ‘suspicious’ is subjective as well. Whereas
sickness, for example, is an externally verifiable phenomenon, suspicion
is purely a subjective, internal assessement of the situation at hand. This
is, of course, still evidential because the evidence perceived in the boy and
the girl’s behavior are what lead to the (internally assessed) inference of
suspicious actions.
2.4.4  <PV + CONJ + C>
The <PV + CONJ + C> construction, as is the case in English, allows
speakers to indicate that there is visual (or observational) evidence not for
an existing state of affairs, but rather for a possible or hypothetical state of
affairs. The conjunctions one finds most often here are als, als ob, and als
wenn (all mean roughly ‘as if ’). Hence the verb of the subordinate clause
always appears in the present or past subjunctive:
(261)	 ‘er sieht aus’, versetzte der eine, ‘als ob er nicht mit sich spaßen
lasse’. (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (1829),
Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 8, S. 379)
	 ‘“He looks”, proclaimed one of them, “as if you can’t mess with
him”.’
(262)	 sieht es doch aus, als wolltet Ihr mir ins Handwerk greifen und
mir die Kundschaft entziehen. (Goethe Corpus: Dichtung und
Wahrheit (1811–1833), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 9, S. 179)
	 ‘But it looks as if you wanted to meddle in my affairs and take
away my customers.’
(263)	 In der Nacht vom Donnerstag auf Freitag schlug jede Minute eine
schwere Granate in die Stadt ein. Manche Stadtteile sehen aus,
als habe ein schweres Erdbeben stattgefunden. Aus einer Meldung
des ‘Petit – Parisien –’ geht hervor, daß zahlreiche Dörfer in der
130	 Chapter 2
Umgebung von Verdun geräumt worden sind. (DWDS Corpus:
‘Die Zerstörung Verduns’, in: Vossische Zeitung (Morgen-Aus-
gabe), 2.3.1916, S. 1)
	 ‘OnThursdaynight,ashellstruckthecityeveryminute.Certain
parts of town look as if a major earthquake occurred. Accord-
ing to a report in the Petit-Parisien, numerous villages in the
vicinity of Verdun have been evacuated.’
(264)	Nichts unterscheidet ihn von dem knorrigen, zähen, vorsichti-
gen, pfiffigen Schlag, mit dem nicht allzu gut Kirschen essen ist,
so saftig sie dort wachsen. Er sieht aus, als ob er immer in dieser
Enge gelebt hätte. Und ist doch der Maler Professor Hagemeister
… (DWDS Corpus: Fritz Stahl, ‘Der alte Hagemeister’, in:
Berliner Tageblatt (Morgen-Ausgabe) 12.3.1918, S. 2)
	 ‘Nothing differentiates him from the gnarled, tough, careful,
sharp type with whom you can’t mess around. He looks as if
he always had lived in this narrowness. And yet is it none other
than the painter Professor Hagemeister.’
In (261) and (263), where the present subjunctive is used, evidence points
to the very likely possibility that the content of the conjoined clause is real,
although the use of the past subjunctive makes things a bit more tentative
in (262). In (263) and (264), however, the situations are only hypothetical
because it is known that what is described in the subordinate clause is not
thecase.Forexample,thecontextof(263)makesitclearthatnoearthquake
has occurred, but rather that the damage from the military onslaught is
responsible for the damage. But nevertheless, the extent and nature of the
destruction provide visual evidence for asserting that an earthquake could
have happened. And as (263) shows, non-raised constructions are also to
be found with the <PV + CONJ + C> pattern in German; indeed, the
majority of cases (nine out of ten (90%) in the Goethe Corpus; thirty-one
out of forty-two (73.8%) in the DWDS Corpus) of evidential aussehen in
this complementation pattern are not raised. But as is the case with raised
versus non-raised instances of Englishlookin 2.3.4, it is not apparently clear
whether instances of non-raised aussehen are indeed more intersubjective
than their raised counterparts either. Nothing in the immediate linguistic
Visual Perception	 131
context, nor in the larger discourse contexts, points to the perceptive act
and subsequent inference being made by anyone besides the SP/W.
There are also a few cases (primarily in the DWDS Corpus, although
there is one instance in the Goethe Corpus as well) where the adverbs
beinah(e) and fast (both translate ‘almost’) make the perceived evidence
tentative without completely negating it:
(265)	 Drüben setzt sich unvermittelt die Gruppe der Offiziere in Bewe-
gung. Es sieht fast aus, als hätten auch diese die Ankunft der
Russin erwartet. (DWDS: Annie Jader, ‘Most’, in: Vossische Zei-
tung (Morgen-Ausgabe), 7.3.1923, S. 6)
	 ‘The group of officers over there abruptly begin to stir. Italmost
looks as if they also had expected the arrival of the Russian
woman.’
Here, the author supposes the actions of the officers indicated that they
may well have expected the Russian woman to arrive, but she does not
assert this visual evidence to be wholly indicative of this possibility and
thus uses the adverb fast. However, this possibility is left open because the
evidence signaled by aussehen is not negated completely, but merely left
open at a lesser degree of authorial commitment.
2.4.5  Summary of aussehen
German aussehen behaves much like its English counterpartlook: with the
exception of <PV + {IC + ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}>, it evinces
the same complementation patterns expressing the same evidential mean-
ings, namely inference resulting from direct visual perception or observa-
tion. There is only one case of the <PV + PPnach> construction, however.
Based on the scarce data provided by the Bonner and Kant corpora, it is
difficult to ascertain whether any historical trends or shifts are at work.
Goethe employs the <PV + ADJ> construction type more often than the
<PV + CONJ + C> pattern, whereas the opposite is true of examples
in the DWDS Corpus. It would not, however, behoove us to draw any
132	 Chapter 2
conclusions about historical trends here because we’re dealing with a single
author versus several authors, as well as varying text types in both corpora,
not to mention corpus size and total number of evidential attestations in
each corpus. But it is safe to conclude that evidentialaussehen, like eviden-
tial look, is solely a marker of inference and fails to display the high degree
of polysemy evinced by its subject-oriented counterpart sehen.
2.5  Chapter Summary
Whether we are dealing with the subject-oriented see and sehen or the
object-oriented look and aussehen, the English and German data exhibit
remarkably similar behavior, especially when it comes to the types of evi-
dential meaning expressed by the varying complementation patterns. See
and sehen, when appearing in the <PV + FCC> constellation, attest a
high degree of polysemy: they can signal direct visual perception, observa-
tion, inference, knowledge, or understanding as being the evidence for the
proposition in the complement clause. Such is also the case in the <PV +
WH-CC> construction. The only major difference here is the use of the
presentparticipleofEnglish see (seeing)asanevidentialconjunction,which
not only denotes causality between two clauses (i.e. seeing x, (thus) y), but
also that the speaker possesses some sort of evidence for the clause directly
within the scope of seeing, and thus of the causality itself. The same holds
for the English present participle in the <PV + DO + NFV> construc-
tion, which differentiates progressive aspect from the perfective aspect
marked by an infinitive complement. In German, any aspectual difference
is not formally marked and is thus to be understood from context. But in
both English and German, this complementation pattern is where one is
most likely to find direct visual perception functioning as the evidential
component (although other evidential meanings are also possible). And
when the past participle serves as the non-finite verbal complement in
both English and German, visual evidence for either a passivized sense of
Visual Perception	 133
action or for a resultant state is indicated. Parentheticals (<PARENTH>)
tend mostly to signal an internal mental process or state (i.e. inference or
knowledge and understanding) of the SP/W, while the use of see and sehen
external (<EXT>) to the clause can signal either literal or metaphorical
visual evidence in both English and German. When the plural pronoun we
or wir is used as the grammatical subject of the perception verb, shades of
intersubjectivity are present: either the SP/Ws indicate that the perceptual
evidence available to them is available to a larger speech community as well,
or they explicitly assume their audience shares the perceptual evidence –
and any subsequent inference based thereon – with them.
Regarding look and aussehen, there are also more similarities than dif-
ferences. Both serve as markers of inference grounded in visual perception
or observation. Rasing versus non-raising is not an overt indicator of sub-
jectivity or intersubjectivity with either English look or German aussehen,
even though this has been argued to be the case with such constructions
(Langacker1999; Nuyts 2001; Verhagen 2005). Englishattests a<PV + {IC
+ ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}> construction which has no direct
German equivalent, but here too, the same type of evidential meaning is
expressed as that found in <PV + PP>, <PV + ADJ>, and <PV + CONJ
+ C> complementation patterns.
We have also seen that the presence of modal verbs cancels out any
evidential meaning, as does negation when coupled with subject-oriented
perception verbs. The only exception here is if the modal verb denotes
ability or knowledge, i.e. if can or können are used. When this occurs, the
modal meaning contributes to the evidential meaning, addding shades of
dispositional ability to the perceptive act. An act of perception still occurs
– which is not the case when any other modal verb is used – which conse-
quently means that the available evidence for the proposition in the scope
of the perception verb continues to be present. Evidential meaning is also
absent when a subject-oriented perception verb falls within the scope of
a negator, which entails that this percetpual evidence is not present at all.
And where there is no evidence, there can be no evidentiality. However,
when a negator takes scope over an object-oriented perception verb in
the <PV + ADJ> complementation pattern, evidence continues to exist;
it is merely opposite in meaning to its non-negated counterpart. That is,
134	 Chapter 2
the negator’s semantic scope falls over the attribute in question, not over
the evidence itself (e.g. being well vs. not being well). And finally, the evi-
dential reading can be weakened (but not obliterated) by the presence of
matrix clauses such as I think or methinks, which contain a cognitive verb,
or adverbs such as almost, beinah(e), and fast.
Chapter 3
Auditory Perception
We now turn our attention to the evidential verbs of auditory perception,
the second most prominent sensory modality. The subject-oriented verbs
under investigation are English hear and German hören, which tend to
express only two types of evidential meaning: direct auditory perception
and the content of first- and second-hand reported information (the latter
is known as hearsay). In terms of object-oriented perception verbs, we will
look at English sound, as well as German (sich) anhören and klingen. These
verbs tend to express inference based on auditory evidence.1 The verbs
of auditory perception fail to evince the variety of evidential meanings
expressed by verbs of visual perception, but quantitatively speaking, they
do enjoy a high frequency of usage and their evidential uses actually occur
at a higher rate than their visual counterparts.
3.1  hear
3.1.1  Quantiative Results
After see, English hear is the second most frequent occurring perception
verb that appears in both the Helsinki and ARCHER corpora. Of a total

signal evidential meaning. And in the ARCHER Corpus, 200 (24.5%) of

Both corpora show a tendency for the Type I complementation to be pre-
ferred among SP/Ws of English. The Type III pattern also enjoys a rela-
tively high frequency of usage. And both the parenthetical and external
evidential constructions are used significantly less often than construction
Types I and III (as was also the case in Chapter 2). Finally, the Type II pat-
tern occurs least of all.
3.1.2  <PV + FCC>
When hear occurs in this construction type, it is almost always an indicator
of hearsay evidence, i.e. the SP/W reports that the information was received
from some second-hand source, and this source is generally left unspecified:

In all these examples, no event has been heard directly; rather, it is reported
that the content of the proposition has been acquired via hearsay. That is,
the SP/W has heard someone else assert the content of the proposition,
and this content is to be believed. So in (269), the writer did not literally
hear Captain Park and his men arrive in St. Margate’s Bay, but he rather
heard someone else report this event to have happened. That is, the focus
here is more on the content of what was heard rather than on the hearing
itself.Anactofauditoryperceptiondoesoccur,butitisthemeansbywhich
the reported information was acquired rather than direct evidence for this

In (272) and (275), the geographical origin of the reported information
is indicated, although the specific individual responsible for relaying this
material is left unspecified. In (273) and (274), the actual source of infor-
mation is indicated. Indeed, (273) is one of the only cases of a non-hearsay
evidential in the <PV + FCC> complementation pattern because the
source of information is synonymous with the topic of information: Mary
Proud’s husband is reporting about his own health, and the information
is therefore first-hand and not second-hand. In (274), on the other hand,
the source of information concerning James and his whereabouts is not
James himself, but rather the addressee’s aunt. We find ourselves with sec-
ond-hand information and thus a hearsay evidential. Interestingly, hearsay
sometimes is explicitly marked as such, i.e. the speech-act verb say occurs
right alongside the perception verb hear:
(276)	 Iheardsaythatyourhusbandwouldnowputyouinyourhood,and
silke gowne, I pray you is it true? (Helsinki Corpus: CEFICT2B,

Auditory Perception	 139
Here, the speaker indicates that a non-specified individual (or individuals)
hasassertedthecontentofthepropositiontobetrueandexplicitlyindicates
that this was said and subsequently perceived through hearing.
Here, as with several other cases of evidential perception verbs, the
presence of a negator eliminates any possible evidential meaning from the
utterance:
(277)	 I do not hear yet, that you have spoken one word against me; here
is no Treason of mine done: If my Lord (^Cabham^) be a Traitor,
what is that to me? (Helsinki Corpus: CETRI2B, The Trial of
Sir Walter Raleigh (1570–1640), p. I,209.C1)
Since the speaker has not heard that the addressee has attempted to slan-
der him, there can be no hearsay evidence – or any evidence at all for that
matter – for (yet) unasserted claims. A lack of evidence exists because the
perceptual act required to obtain this evidence, i.e. the hearing of reported
speech, is also lacking.
3.1.3  <PV + WH-CC>
There are only two cases in the Helsinki Corpus where hear occurrs with a
wh-complementizer clause, and they are both from the same source:
(278)	 Thence I up to the Lords’ House to enquire for Lord Bellasses;
and there hear how at a conference this morning between the two
Houses, about the business of the Canary Company – my Lord
Buckingham leaning rudely over my Lord Marquis of Dorches-
ter, my Lord Dorchester removed his elbow. (Helsinki Corpus:

1667), P VII, p. 414)

Diary of Samuel Pepys (1666–1667), P VIII, pp. 317–18)
Hear in (278) appears to be more a marker of hearsay evidence, for Pepys
is reporting on an event – Lord Buckingham’s rude behavior at a confer-
ence – at which he assumedly was not present and was only told about.
But in (279), Pepys is present at the events at Westminster Hall and reports
on what he heard occurring, so there is more of a sense of direct auditory
perception here. Of course, the wh-word how leaves the manner of the
events in (278) and (279) unspecified, but there is still (auditory) evidence
that these events occurred.
3.1.4  <PV + DO + NFV>
3.1.4.1  Infinitive
As was the case with evidential see, the taking of an infinitive complement
in the <PV + DO + NFV> construction is where one is most likely to
find hear signaling direct auditory perception. That is, unlike in the <PV
+ FCC> pattern, the focus is on the hearing itself rather than on reported
information:
(280)	 I heare you mumble (^Dauy^). (Helsinki Corpus: CEPLAY2B,
Thomas Middleton, A Chaste Maid in Cheapside (1630), p. 5)
(281)	 But here the Knight will be immediately; for I heard him give
Orders to lock up the Doors, till he return’d from the Coffee-house.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1709cent.d3b, Susanna Centlivre, The
Man’s Bewitch’d, or, The Devil to Do about Her, In The Plays of
Susanna Centlivre, vol. 2, ed. Richard C. Frushell, New York:
Garland, 1982)
(282)	 Well, I must even be going too. I have my cattle to water. I but
bolted in when I heard the poor lass screech, thinking I might do
somewhat.(ARCHERCorpus:1893wilk.d6a,MaryE.Wilkins,
Giles Corey, Yeoman)
Auditory Perception	 141
Of course, the content of what is heard is not necessarily irrelevant, as is
the case in (281). The writer reports that the knight has given orders to
lock the doors, and his evidence is that he directly heard this, as opposed
to hearing from someone else that orders were given. I found one instance
where the infinitive particle to was present:
(283)	 For I have heard some foreiners to blame us (^English-men^) for
neglecting this mean to a plain and audible speaking, saying, that
the cause, why we generally do not speak so fully as they, proceeded
from an ill habit of mumbling, which children got at their first
learning to read; which it was their care; therfore to prevent or
remedy betimes, and so it should be ours, seeing (^Pronouncia-
tion is that that sets out a man, and is sufficient of it self to make
one an Oratour^). (Helsinki Corpus: CEEDUC3B, Charles
Hoole, A New Discovery of the Old Art of Teaching Schoole
(1660), pp. 3–4)
The content of what is heard is also relevant here vis-à-vis (281), and the
writer is the one who has directly heard the accusations of foreigners. The
presence of the infinitive particle does not seem to add or detract anything
from the meaning of the construction; perhaps this is merely writer pref-
erence, or this was the historical norm which has since become obsolete.
In any case, this was the only instance in the corpora examined, so further
investigation would be necessary before any definitive claims could be
made.
Sometimes when the infinitive complement that occurs withhear is a
speech-act verb, there is an additional clause that follows the <PV + DO
+ NFV> construction. When this occurs, there is an additional evidential
meaning of reported speech because not only is the actual perceptive act
described by hear indicated, but also the content of what was heard:
(284)	 I heard you say, if I did not mistake your speech that there be
witchesthatworkebythedeuill.(HelsinkiCorpus:CEHAND2A
(GeorgeGifford,AHandbookonWitchesandWitchcraft(1593),
p. B4V)
142	 Chapter 3
(285)	 … and I have often heard him say, a fat Living was the best Meat
in the World. (Helsinki Corpus: CEPLAY3A, John Vanbrugh,
The Relapse, (1640–1710), p. I,64)
(286)	 Indeed,Ihaveheardoneofthebesthusbandsintheworld,declare,
in the presence of his wife, that he had always loved a princess with
adoration. (ARCHER Corpus: 1751fiel.f4b, Henry Fielding,
Amelia)
In(284)through(286),theSP/Wsmerelypresentuswithindirectdiscourse
in the complementizer clause (for which there is auditory evidence), but
they also claim to have direct auditory evidence concerning the uttering
of this propositions.
One could argue that all cases of hear coupled with a speech-act verb
should fall under the <PV + DO + NFV> category. The absence of a direct
object (see (276), for example) could be argued to be due to elision because
the speaker does not wish to mark the source of information. However, I
do not take this position here because there is a clear semantic distinction
between pure hearsay evidentiality when there is no direct object present
and direct or indirect discourse – whether it be hearsay or not – is being
reported, and when a direct object is present. In addition, the coupling of
hear with a speech-act verb such as say or tell appears at least partially idi-
omatic: again, consider the differing semantics of I hear say versus I hear
you/her say.2
Sometimes, the writer will indicate that there is evidence for direct
discourse through the use of the <PV + DO + NFV> pattern with the
cited discourse in quotation marks:
(287)	 (‘We’re the scum of the earth and there’s always somebody around
to remind us of it’, I heard one of them say last week) – but not
Gary. (ARCHER Corpus: 1973cole.j8a, John Coleman, Blue
Collar Diary: A College President’s Sabbatical)
2	 This position is also taken in the discussion of German hören in Section 3.2.
Auditory Perception	 143
Although the exact speaker is not pinpointed here, the discourse content
is cited verbatim, as signified by the quotation marks.
There are two instances (one in Helsinki, one in ARCHER) where
the modal verb can takes scope over evidential hear, and in both cases, it
is clear that auditory abilitiy – as opposed to simple idiomatic usage – is
in focus:
(288)	 wee can heare now and then a Harquebusse or a Musket goe off,
which they doe seldome discharge in vaine … (Helsinki Corpus:
CETRAV2A, John Taylor, The Pennyless Pilgrimage (1630),
p. 136.C1)
(289)	 Sure they must needs hear me knock, for I can hear them gabbel
… (ARCHER Corpus: 1671cary.d2b, John Caryll,Sir Salomon;
or The Cautious Coxcomb)
These are still evidential uses of hear because, even though the ability to
hear is emphasized by the modal verb, an event is still perceived auditorily
by the writers, and this perception continues to provide evidence for the
event being described. Interestingly in (289), another evidential meaning
is present, namely that of inference. But this is not expressed by the percep-
tion verb; instead, the modal verb must in the preceding clause describes
the inference resulting from the act of auditory perception (or, maybe to
be a bit more precise, the ability to hear the gabbling). Because the writer
possesses auditory evidence for gabbling, he infers that those inside the
house have heard him knock. It should be clear by now that evidential
meanings need not occur in isolation, but rather, they can interact with
one another, as well as with modality, aspect, and tense.
In a similar vein, there are three instances (two in Helsinki, one in
ARCHER) of hear being preceded by the cognitive verb think:
(290)	 And then me thought I harde you saye euen nowe that you had a
watche word, at which word we wyll all stepforth, being fiue of vs
besydes you, for you shalbe none because it is your husbande, but
gette you to bed at your accustomed houre. (Helsinki Corpus:
144	 Chapter 3
CEFICT1B, Thomas Harman, A Caveat or Warening for
Commen Cursetors Vulgarely Called Vagabones (1567), p. 71)
(291)	 But nowe me thynketh I heare one saye vnto me, wotte you what
yousay?(HelsinkiCorpus:CESERM1B,HughLatimer, Sermon
on the Ploughers (1549), p. 24)
(292)	 Oh, ’tis intollerable: methinks I hear a great she Devil call for
Groat’s <Groats> worth of the Crispe of my Countenance. – They
are all for Gristle. (ARCHER Corpus: 1675duff.d2b, Thomas
Duffet, The Mock-Tempest, In Three Burlesque Plays of Thomas
Duffet, ed. Ronald Eugene DiLorenzo, Iowa City: University
of Iowa Press, 1972)
The auditory evidence here is made a bit more tentative because the SP/
Ws cannot say for certain exactly what was heard, but as is the case with
the modal verb can, an act of perception nonetheless occurred and the SP/
Ws describe – to the best of their ability – what they think they heard.
In (290) and (291), discourse (indirect in (290); unclear in (291)) is what
was perceived, while a singular act of auditory perception is described in
(292).
I found a few instances in the Helsinki Corpus where, although hear
appeared in the <PV + DO + NFV> complementation pattern with an
infinitive complement, no evidential meaning was expressed. This was due
to the semantics of hear having more a sense of ‘listen to’ (agentive) rather
than ‘hear’ (experiential):
(293)	 After priuat praier I walked and did eate my breakfast : then I
reed a chapter of the Bible to my mother, and repeted the Doctrins
which from thence I had hard Mr Rhodes Colecte : then I went to
the church, wher I hard Mr Pamer speak, but to small profitte to
any … (Helsinki Corpus: CEDIAR2B, Margaret Hoby, Diary
of Lady Margaret Hoby (1599–1605), p. 73)
In such cases there is no evidential meaning because the speaker is focusing
more on their active attempt at perception (agentive perception) rather
than the experience of perception as a source of information. As has already
Auditory Perception	 145
beendiscussedinSection1.2.3,thefocusisonthesubject’sintenttoperceive
rather than on the perception itself, and since evidential meaning arises
from perception itself rather than from the intent to perceive, such agen-
tive perception verbs such as listen or look (at) are rarely, if ever, carriers
of evidential meaning. This is certainly the case in (293), where Margaret
Hoby indicates she listened to Mr Rhodes ‘colecte’ and Mr Pamer ‘speak’,
but she does not indicate that her experience of auditory perception pro-
vides her with evidence for these propositions; she only indicates that she
took an active role in the perception of what Mr Rhodes and Mr Pamer
were doing. Such cases are not included in the figures in Table 5.
3.1.4.2  Present Participle
There are no cases of evidential hear taking a present participle as a verbal
complement in the Helsinki Corpus, but there are several in the ARCHER
Corpus,andmostatteststraightforwardreadingsofdirectauditorypercep-
tion as evidence for the proposition over which hear has scope:
(294)	 I hear her coming; this is her hour for music and dancing.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1753foot.d4b, Samuel Foote, The Eng-
lishman in Paris, In The Works of Samuel Foote, vol. 1, ed. Jon
Bee, London: Sherwood, Gilbert, and Piper, 1830)
(295)	 I just sold a customer of mine a bill of machshoves – and when he
came to the door here I heard Bronson speaking to Mr. Winslow,
so I waited on the outside, and, what do you think, Rebecca? Mr.
Winslow is going to take Miss Ellen to Mlle. Celesta tonight, so
she may see for herself that Jack goes there. (ARCHER Corpus:
1880jess.d6a, George H. Jessop, Sam’l of Posen, In America’s
Lost Plays, vol. 4, Eds I. Goldberg and H. Hefner, 1940)
(296)	 It was a little like her old apartment in the Village and I also
thought of the suite at the Ritz in Paris when I heard Dottie
whistling in her bedroom. (ARCHER Corpus: 1951marq.f8a,
John Phillips Marquand, Melville Goodwin, USA)
146	 Chapter 3
The speaker in (295), for example, can report that Bronson was speaking to
Mr Winslow because he heard this conversation as it happened, and audi-
tory perception thus serves as evidence for the reporting of its occurrence.
And as was the case with evidential see, the present participle contributes
a progressive aspectual flavoring to the event being described.
There is one instance where this construction functions as evidence
for the reporting of indirect discourse, similar to examples (284) through
(288):
(297)	 Well, I heard Ben Plunkett sayin’ that he’d bought, but wasn’t
<wuzn’t> to say anything about it tell the time come. and <An’> I
thought a father ought to know what’s going on in his own family.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1878eggl.f6a, Edward Eggleston, Roxy, In
Americans in Fiction Series No. 31, 1968)
As with cases where an infinitive complement was used, the speaker here
indicates that he heard what Ben Plunkett said and provides the informa-
tion here in the form of indirect discourse. There was also one instance of
the modal verb can appearing in this verbal constellation:
(298)	 That he didn’t even remember me, let alone what I’d threatened
to do to him – and I could hear the children quarrelling in the
garden, the baby crying in her cot, and when I sat down in the
sitting-room there was a piece in The Times on the phasing out of
Public Schools and Private Health, lumped together, and it all
seemed – well! (ARCHER Corpus: 1975gray.d8b, Simon Gray,
Otherwise Engaged: A Play)
Here,auditoryevidenceisprovidedfortheassertionthatchildrenarequar-
reling and the baby is crying, and the writer adds the modal flavoring of
ability to the narration without cancelling the already existing evidential
meaning. The same is true in the one instance of the cognitive verb think
taking scope over evidential hear:
Auditory Perception	 147
(299)	 I must not hearken to such Sophistry – Hark! Ithink I hear some-
body coming, and have reason to believe that of late I have had
Spies upon my Actions – Step into the Closet, while I see who ’tis.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1735hayw.d3b, Eliza Haywood, A Wife to
be Let)
The evidence is made tentative by the presence of think, but it is not elimi-
nated completely, as is the general case with negation.
Hearsay evidentiality can also be expressed here, but only when the
verbal particle of appears with hear:3
(300)	We have heard too much, of the troops and ships coming over,
we suppose you mean; we have not heard more, if more there be.
(ARCHER: 1776leac.d4a, John Leacock, The Fall of British
Tyrany, In Representative Plays by American Dramatists, ed.
Montrose J. Moses, New York: E. P. Dutton & Co., 1919)
Here, the arrival of the troops and ships is not something that has been
perceived directly by the speaker, but instead it is an event that has been
reported to this speaker, who in turn indicates that, according to hearsay,
this is indeed going on. Sometimes both a present and a past participle
occur as complements to hear of, and in all cases, being serves as the present
participle:
(301)	 I have heard of a Tetanus being cured in the island of Grenada
by large doses of mustard. (ARCHER Corpus: 1786rus2.m4a,
Benjamin Rush, ‘Observations on the Cause and Cure of the
3	 Whereascasesofverbalparticlescoupledwithperceptionverbsaretreatedasseparate
lexical items in German, they are merely considered a specific usage (and hence a
subtype) of the perception verbs in English. This is the standard practice of lexicog-
raphers (contrast respective entries in the DWB with the OED, for example), and
regarding the quantiative data, I will follow the same practice here. Hence aussehen
and (sich) anhören are presented as separate items from sehen and hören, whereas
cases of hear of are subsumed under hear.
148	 Chapter 3
Tetanus’, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, vol.
II (1786), pp. 225–31)
(302)	 I only hear of my letter being published by a telegram from Mr
Ross…(ARCHERCorpus:1897wild.x6b,OscarWilde,Selected
Letters of Oscar Wilde, ed. Rupert Hart-Davis, Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 1979, pp. 39–40)
The reported event in such cases is presented in a passivized sense; however,
the presence of the present participle being adds a progressive aspectual
coloring to the event in question. There were a total of six cases in the
ARCHER Corpus of hear of occurring with a present participle comple-
ment, five being present + past participle couplings. One could perhaps
include this count under the past participle category, but since the present
participle here takes scope over the past participle, I decided to include
these examples among the count of present participle constructions.
3.1.4.3  Past Participle
When a past participle is employed as the non-finite verbal complement in
the <PV + DO + NFV> construction, the event is presented in a passive
sense with the agent either obscured or altogether absent. Direct auditory
perception is always the type of evidence which is signified here:
(303)	 Secondly, Besides I have heard it spoken to the great commenda-
tion of some Countries, where care is had for the well education
of children, that every Peasant (almost) is able to discourse with a
strangerintheLatinetongue …(HelsinkiCorpus:CEEDUC3B,

(304)	 Ihaveheardthepresentdiminutionofthehumanbodyinstrength
and size, compared with its ancient vigor and form, ascribed in
part to the introduction of linen garments. (ARCHER Corpus:

Increase of Bilious and Intermitting Fevers in Pennsylvania,

Philosophical Society 2, 206–12)
(305)	 We have only heard her spoken of as a very pleasant lady, who
has been very kind to Willie. (ARCHER Corpus: 1863holm.
j6a, Emma Holmes, The Diary of Miss Emma Holmes, ed. John
F. Marszalek, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press,
1979)
So in (304), the writer has heard directly from some unspecified source
that the introduction of linen garments has been ascribed to the ‘present
diminution’ of the human body. The perceived act is presented passively
because the agent of the action (the ascriber of the introduction of linen
garmentstothe‘diminution’ofthehumanbody)isleftunspecified.Whatis
more important here is the content of what was reported, rather than who
is reporting the information. The direct object is no longer the agent, but
rather the patient of the perceived action; the ascribing of the ‘diminution’
of the human body is what is in focus in (304), rather than who is ascribing
it. One case of the modal verb can coupled with hear is to be found here,
butaswithothercases,evidentialmeaningisnotaffectedandanadditional
modal coloring of SP/W ability to perceive auditorily is added:
(306)	 … whereas quite contrary they will without the least opposition
permit the first, but with the greatest difficulty admit of the last.
For as soon as she saw me ready to engage, she <cryed> cried out
incessantly, Whillallalloo; and presently I could hear this ulula-
tion ecchoed. (ARCHER Corpus: 1665head.f2b, Richard Head
and Francis Kirkman, The English Rogue: Described in the Life
of Meriton Latroon)
There are virtually no cases of the past participle indicating some sort of
resultant state semantics when occurring in this construction with hear; all
are cases of direct auditory perception of an event that the SP/W presents
in a passive sense by obscuring the agent of action. The other cases of such
a construction were found in the Helsinki Corpus, and here a passivized
presentation of the reported action is featured:
150	 Chapter 3
(307)	 I have heard within two or three days of six or seven robberies
hereabouts committed: whereof two or three killed. (Helsinki
Corpus: CEPRIV3, John Strype, Letter to Mother, (1664))
John Strype does not indicate who has committed the robberies; he only
states that he has hearsay evidence that robberies have been committed
without specifiying the agents of action.
3.1.5  <PARENTH>
Hearsay evidentiality is the sole type of evidential meaning expressed by
hear in parenthetical constructions, atleast insofar as the data in the cor-
pora are concerned:
(308)	 I would write more particularly, but y=e= vessell I heare is goeing
away presently; soe, haveing no more att present, butt duty to your
self and my mother, I remain your dutyfull Son, Rich=d= Had-
dock. (Helsinki Corpus: CEPRIV3, Richard Haddock, Letter

(309)	 If you visit My Lord and Lady Oxford, and their Daughter who

(310)	 He wears tin boots to prevent the issue from running over into

In(309)then,thewriterindicateshehasreceivedsecond-handinformation
that the Lord and Lady Oxford’s daughter has now become a duchess, but
the source of this information remains unspecified.
Auditory Perception	 151
Parentheticalconstructionsneednotcontaintheverb hear alone;they
may also appear with the verbal particleof  (311) or a speech-act verb which
further emphasizes the hearsay nature of the evidential meaning (312):
(311)	 The distemper to Men never, that we hear of, proves mortal.
(ARCHERCorpus:1675ai–.s2b,A.I.,‘AConjectureConcern-
ing the Bladders of Air that are Found in Fishes’, Philosophical
Transactions 10.114)
(312)	 But what I was going <gaun> to say, she had a bonny bit fair-
haired, blue-eyed <blue-ee’d> lassie of a servant-maid that lodged
in the house <wi’> with her, just by all the world like a lamb
<wi’> with a wolf – a bonnier <quean> queen, I’ve heard tell,
never <steppit> stepped in leather <shoon> shoes … (ARCHER
Corpus: 1828moir.f5b, David Macbeth Moir, The Life of Mansie
Wauch, Tailor in Dalkeith)
There appears a heightened sense of intersubjectivity among parentheti-
cal constructions signaling hearsay as opposed to the hearsay indicated by
<PV + FCC> constructions discussed in Section 3.1.2. In the latter, the
SP/W merely reports that s/he has second-hand information (reported
and subsequently perceived auditorily) for the proposition in question.
But here, the phrasing of parentheticals – particularly through the use of
the conjunction as – makes the hearsay evidence a bit more intersubjec-
tive. That is, when Swift in (309) uses as I hear … as opposed to I hear that
…, he leaves open the possibility that others may have heard differently, or
that others could perceive the same evidence differently. There is a greater
awareness of a larger speech community, and therefore an implicit accept-
ance of alternate possibilities of perception, evidence, and interpretations
thereof. This is similar to parenthetical constructions involving evidential
see (Section 2.1.5), which also express a high degree of speaker-centeredness
in relation to the evidence, while simultaneously leaving alternate possibili-
ties open to a larger community.
152	 Chapter 3
3.1.6  <EXT>
The types of evidential meaning expressed by hear are more varied in con-
structions external to the proposition for which evidence is provided.
Hearsay is, of course, one type of evidence that can be signaled by <EXT>
constructions:
(313)	 By what I have heard of them, they have well learnd the lesson of
Iago, to Rodorigo, ‘put money in thy purse.’ (ARCHER Corpus:
1766aadm.x4a, Abigail Adams, In Adams Family Correspond-
ence, vol. 1: December 1761–May 1776, ed. L. H. Butterfield,
Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963, pp. 55–6)
(314)	 We have heard from the fight – two of our men killed and one
Indian and several ponies, one of our men had 10 arrows shot into
him, scalped and fingers cut off and terribly mangled. (ARCHER
Corpus: 1865penn.j6a, Jake Pennock, Diary of Jake Pennock, In
Annals of Wyoming 21.1, pp. 4–29)
Thus in (314), the casualties at a certain battle are described in terms of
a report eminating from the battlefield itself. The source of information
can also be presented in external constructions, and this is what is done
in (315) below:
(315)	 (‘By the way, Hen, there’s some sort of rumor around that this
thing has gotten to the students. They even say that there’s a peti-
tion circulating. Do you know anything about it?’) Henry held
himself taut … (‘I don’t believe it’,) he finally said, in measured
tones,bitingoffthewords,onebyone.Johnscratchedhisear,which
had a rather pendulous lobe from being pulled, thoughtfully, in
many a long discussion. (‘So they say’,) he repeated. The moment
prolonged itself, awkwardly. (‘I heard it’,) he added, as though
apologizing, (‘from Bill Fraenkel, who had it from a student.
There’s a girl, Lilia Something, a freshman, who’s supposed to be
passing a petition.’) (ARCHER Corpus: 1951mcca.f8a, Mary
McCarthy, The Groves of Academe)
Auditory Perception	 153
John indicates that his information source is Bill Fraenkel. But John indi-
cates that Bill’s source is an unnamed student, so even here, the ultimate
source of the information remains vague because of embedding. The
speaker John merely removes any personal responsibility for the truth of
the rumor by indicating his immediate source of the information. Direct
auditory perception can also be a type of evidence expressed in external
constructions:
(316)	 DANIELL: You propounde a particular example, and let vs exam-
ine euerything in it touching the witch, for the womans fact that
went to the wise man, wee are not yet come to that point. You say
the Cat came to her when she was in a great rage with one of her
neighbours, and did curse, wishing the vengeance of God to fall
vpon him and his.
	 SAMUELL: She said so indeede. I heard her with mine own ears,
for I was at the execution. (Helsinki Corpus: CEHAND2A,
George Gifford, A Handbook on Witches and Witchcraft (1593),
pp. E1R–E1V)
Samuell explains to a somewhat doubtful Daniell that the alleged witch
cursed her neighbor in a ‘great rage’ with the evidence of direct auditory
perception because he was present when this curse was uttered and there-
fore has direct auditory evidence to support the claim that the alleged
witch uttered such a curse.
3.1.6  Summary of hear
We have seen that the evidential hear does not evince the rich and complex
landscape of evidential meanings present with the subject-oriented verb
of visual perception, see. Three clear-cut types of evidential meaning are
expressed by hear: direct auditory perception, first-hand reported infor-
mation, and second-hand reported information (hearsay). When taking
a complementizer clause in its scope or functioning as a parenthetical
construction, hear is solely a marker of the latter two types of evidence.
154	 Chapter 3
When occurring in the <PV + DO + NFV> complementation pattern or
as an external marker to the evidentialized discourse,hear expresses a wider
variety of evidential meanings. Both direct auditory perception and first-
hand reported information can be indicated, and the presence of the verbal
particle of can add shades of hearsay meaning when it appears. Aspectual
distinctions are made between the infinitive complement and the present
participle, whereas the past participle focuses the described action in a pas-
sivized sense only if hear is used transitively. A resultative reading is only
possible in the company of the verbal particle of. And although there are
only two attestations of the <PV + WH-CC> construction, it appears
that this pattern can mark both hearsay and direct perception. In short,
hear focuses either on hearing itself as evidence or on evidence reported
by – and thus heard from – someone else.
3.2  hören
3.2.1  Quantitative Results
Hören is the second most prominent perception verb found in the German
language corpora (as was the case with hear in English language corpora).
In the Bonner Corpus, there are a total of 477 instances of hören, but
only fourteen (2.9%) signal evidential meaning. We are provided with 251
examplesof hören bytheKantCorpus,twenty-six(10.4%)beingevidential.
The Goethe Corpus attests 749 cases of hören with 102 (13.6%) expressing
evidential meaning. Finally, a random sample of 1,500 cases of hören in
the DWDS Corpus shows 193 (12.9%) of the cases to allow for evidential
readings. Table 6 provides us with the breakdown of complementation
patterns in the corpora:

The data here are far from providing a unified perspective on the behav-
ior of evidential hear. The Type I construction is preferred in both the
Bonner and the Kant corpora, whereas the Type III construction enjoys
prominence in the Goethe Corpus. And most surprisingly, parentheticals
provide the overwhelming majority of cases of evidential hören in the
DWDS Corpus. The only generalizations that can be made here is that,
when evidential hören appears in the <PV + DO + NFV> pattern, the
only type of non-finite verbal complement it takes is an infinitive. Also,
external constructions are rarely, if ever, used in the corpora: there are no
examples in the Kant Corpus or in the DWDS Corpus, while the Bonner
and Goethe corpora provide only one attestation each. This is also the case
withthe<PV+WH-CC>construction,whichoccursatotalofonlythree

3.2.2  <PV + FCC>
Similar to English hear, German hören serves only as a marker of reported
speech when it appears in the <PV + FCC> construction, and it primarily
serves as an indicator of hearsay evidentiality:
(317)	 do hort ich sagen das min vatter wer tott vnd min muoter waer
ainig beliben … (Bonner Corpus: Text 121, Hie vahet an das
buoch von den hailigen Altvaetern (ca. 1400), Blatt 86 verso)
	 ‘Then I heard say that my father was dead and my mother was
alone.’
(318)	 Ich höre, daß Ihre Kritik hier gedruckt wird. (Kant Corpus: AA
X, Briefwechsel (1786), S. 468)
	 ‘I hear that your Critique will be published here.’
(319)	 er ist kein Jüngling mehr, und ich höre, daß er noch immer die
jungen Rollen spielt. (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Wan-
derjahre (1829), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 8, S. 171)
	 ‘He is no longer a youth, and I hear that he still always plays
the young roles.’
(320)	 Ich höre soeben, daß im Ruhrgebiet der Streik schon begonnen
hat. (DWDS Corpus: ‘Landtagsverhandlungen’, in: Vossische
Zeitung (Abend-Ausgabe), 4.3.1912, S. 3–4)
	 ‘I just heard now that in the Ruhr region the strike has already
begun.’
In all these cases, the information is acquired auditorily from second-hand
sources which remain unspecified and are then repeated as hearsay.4 The
presence of a speech-act verb such assagen ‘say’ in (317) further emphasizes
that the nature of evidence is hearsay (Hörensagen). Of course, even if a

source is specified, the evidence can still be considered hearsay when the
source and topic of the information are different:
(321)	 Ich höre von HEn [sic?] Hamann, daß Sie mit der Bearbeitung
der Kritick der reinen Vernunft fast ins Reine gekommen, daß
Sie aber noch balancirten, ob Sie mir, oder Hartung das Werck
geben wolten. (Kant Corpus: AA X, Briefwechsel (1779–1780),
S. 260–1)
	 ‘I hear from Mr Hamann that you almost came to terms with
the editing of the Critique of Practical Reason, but that you are
still deciding whether you want to give the work to me or to
Hartung.’
In (321), Mr Hamann is specified as the source of information, but since
he is reporting on the editing of one of Kant’s works and not talking about
himself, this is still considered second-hand information/hearsay. This is
one of the rare instances where the source of hearsay is indicated; generally,
SP/Ws tend to leave their information source unspecified when empolying
hearsayevidentiality.IdidfindtwocasesintheBonnerCorpuswherehören
in the <PV + FCC> pattern did not signal hearsay, but it rather served as
a marker of indirect discourse:
(322)	 als bald ich von dir hoert das du gern ain moerin haben woltest

Der Eunuchus des Terenz (1486), S. 33 Kommentar)
	 ‘As soon as I heard from you that you wanted to have a Moor-
ish woman as a servant.’
(323)	 JCh habe auff eine zeit aus des frommen Doctoris Medleri Mund

	 ‘I once heard out of the mouth of the pious Dr Medleri that he
said, he thanks God that he did not live at the time of the Lord
Christ and that he did not see him as he hung on the cross.’
158	 Chapter 3
Inbothcases,wearedealingwithfirst-handinformationbecausethesource
and subject of the reported information are synonymous. The fact that the
conjugated verbs in the cited discourse appear in the subjunctive (past
in (322), present in (323)) further emphasizes that we are dealing with
reported speech.
As in English, the negating of the perception verb in the matrix clause
eliminates any possible evidential meaning:
(324)	 Jch habe noch nicht gehoeret / daß ein Koeniglicher Prinz aus
Africa unter den Rebellen geblieben waere. (Bonner Corpus:
Text 147, Christian Weise, Neue Jugend-Lust (1684), S. 130)
	 ‘Istillhaven’theardthataroyalprincefromAfricahasremained
among the rebels.’
(325)	 Während dieser Zeit empfanden auch Pferde und Hunde die
Krankheit, besonders die, so gut gehalten wurden. Die Pferde
hatten heftige Husten, viele Hitze, verloren den Appetit, und es
dauerte lange, ehe sie sich erholten. Ich habe nicht gehört, daß
viele davon gestorben wären; verschiedene Hunde aber starben.
(Kant Corpus: AA VIII, Nachricht an Ärzte (1783), S. 008)
	 ‘During this time, even horses and dogs felt the sickness, espe-
ciallythosewhoweresowellkept.Thehorseshadseverecoughs,
werevery hot,lost theirappetites, andittook a long time before
they recovered. I didn’t hear that many died from this; but vari-
ous dogs did die.’
The writers here report that they are not in possession of hearsay evidence
regarding a prince from Africa in (324) and the number of horse deaths
resulting from sickness in (325). Since this evidence is absent, evidential
meaning is not and cannot be expressed.
3.2.3  <PV + WH-CC>
Much like the English see in this construction, German sehen can be a
marker of both direct auditory perception and hearsay:
Auditory Perception	 159
(326)	 In einer Zwischenpause hörte ich, wie eine Dame ihrem wohl-
genährten,etwasbequemenBegleitereinedringendeBittevortrug
… (DWDS Corpus: ‘Neugierige Frauen hat …’, in: Berliner
Tageblatt (Abend-Ausgabe) 1.3.1905, S. 2)
	 ‘During a break I heard how a woman made an urgent request
to her corpulent, somewhat lazy companion.’
(327)	 Wir hören, wie der Verfasser, von Beruf Journalist, in Moskau
eines Morgens verhaftet wurde, um sechs Tage in russische Kerker
eingesperrt und 21mal in diesen 144 Stunden vernommen, um
gefoltert, erpresst und geschlagen zu werden. (DWDS Corpus:
‘Georg Popow’, in: Berliner Tageblatt (Morgen-Ausgabe)
8.3.1925, S. 15)
	 ‘Wehearhowtheauthor,ajournalistbyprofession,wasarrested
one morning in Moscow, only to be locked up in a Russian
prison for six days and interrogated 21 times during these 144
hours, only to be tortured, blackmailed, and beaten.’
In (326), the woman’s request is perceived directly, but in (327), details of
the journalist’s arrest are gained only through a second-hand information
source. Of course, this could also be part of a larger narration which is
being told, in which case this is not hearsay evidentiality at all, but rather
the reporting of linguistic information that was auditorily perceived. And
as with the English data, the wh-word wie ‘how’ causes the propositions
to lack a degree of specificity regarding the manner of action, but it does
not cancel out evidential meaning. The one other instance of this con-
struction appears to mark direct auditory perception, but in an internal
or imagined manner:
(328)	 Vnd do ich also in diseme grosem froelichen wunder was, so hoere
ich aber wie die aller froelicheste svesseste stimme one alles min
zuotvon inwendig in mir selber vsbrechende ist, vnd sprach die
inwendige suesse stimme alsus zuo mir … (Bonner Corpus: Text
231, Rulmann Merswin, Des Gottesfreundes im Oberland (1352),
S. 19)
160	 Chapter 3
	 ‘And when I was thus in this great joyous wonder, I hear how
the most joyous, sweetest voice was breaking out out inside
myself without me doing anything and spoke to me with the
sweetest inner voice …’
Direct auditory perception is indeed present here; it is simply the case that
Merswin is indicating that this voice was perceived internally and not by
means of traditional, external hearing. The perceptive act involved is simply
described in terms of auditory perception.
3.2.4  <PV + DO + NFV>
This complementation pattern is, expectedly, more conducive to evidence
of direct perception than any other complementation pattern attested by
evidential hören. But in contrast with sehen, which can take both infinitives
andpastparticiplesasitsnon-finiteverbalcomplementinthisconstruction,
evidential hören was found to take only infinitive complements. Examples
can be found in all four of the examined corpora:
(329)	 ZuletztnachallervnsererschwerenArbeyt/sahenwirvonweitem

	 ‘When I hear authors loudly praise each other with all their

flatter one another all the time.’
(331)	 auf einmal höre ich ihn ängstliche, unvernehmliche Töne stam-
meln. (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (1795–
1796), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 7, S. 44)
	 ‘Suddenly I hear him babbling fearful, unclear sounds.’
(332)	 IchhörtedieVögeldurchdenMorgensingen…(DWDSCorpus:
Felix Bösewicht, ‘Moderne Dichter von hinten’, in: Berliner
Tageblatt (17.2.1902), S. 5–6)
	 ‘I heard the birds singing through the morning …’
In (329) through (332), the writers directly hear the described event that
falls within the scope of hören, and any distinctions between perfective and
progressive aspect are not formally distinguished (as they are in English)
and thus lie solely in the act of interpretation. In (330), for example, it is
not formally clear whether we should interpret loben in a perfective or a
progressive sense (both are indeed possible). In (332), the presence of the
prepositional phrase durch den Morgen ‘through the morning’ points in
the direction of an on-going event over a span of time, and the progressive
reading is therefore more likely. But again, since this aspectual distinction
is not formally made as it is in English, both readings are almost always
possible. Indeed, such a lack of formal distinction may render such a dif-
ferentiation irrelevant to the discourse context.
I found forteen attestations in the Goethe Corpus where the auxil-
iary haben is coupled with the infinitive complement to form the double
infinitive construction, and even though there is a direct object, it is not
the agent of action (as has been the case thus far):
(333)	 schon in Leipzig, bei Gelegenheit der Winckelmannschen und
Lessingschen Schriften, hatte ich viel von diesen bedeutenden
Kunstwerken reden hören, desto weniger aber gesehn … (Goethe
Corpus: Dichtung und Wahrheit (1811–1833), Hamburger Aus-
gabe, Band 9, S. 500)
162	 Chapter 3
	 ‘I had already heard much of these important works of art in
Leipzig through Winckelmann’s and Lessing’s writings, but still
less had I seen them …’
(334)	 wir haben ganz nulle Gedichte wegen lobenswürdiger Rhythmik
preisen hören. (Goethe Corpus: Schriften zur Literatur, Ham-
burger Ausgabe, Band 12, S. 350)
	 ‘We have heard completely worthless poems praised because
of their commendable rhythmics.’
In Section 2.2.4.1, we saw that Goethe often uses the double infinitive con-
struction when the auxiliary haben is present. The case is the same here.
And as with the earlier examples, direct auditory perception continues to
be signaled; the perceived event is merely cast into a passive framework,
insofar as the agent of action is obscured in such constructions.
Sometimesevidentialhörenappearswithonlyaninfinitivecomplement
andtheagentisnotindicatedatall.Apassivesemanticsispresent,andthese
constructions are frequently markers of direct or indirect discourse:
(335)	 Nun höre ich aber von allen Seiten rufen: räsonnirt nicht! (Kant

(1785), S. 036)
	 ‘Now I hear shouted from all sides: don’t argue!’
(336)	 tausendmal habe ich klagen hören, daß ein durch Erzählung

	 ‘I have heard lamented a thousand times that a subject matter
in the present which is known via report no longer satisfies …’
(337)	 so hören wir spotten: ‘Sia ammazzato il Signore Abbate che fa
l’amore’. (Goethe Corpus:Zweiter römischer Aufenthalt(1786–
1788), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 11, S. 513)
	 ‘Thus we hear mocking: “Sia ammazzato il Signore Abbate che
fa l’amore.”’
Auditory Perception	 163
(338)	 aber auf einmal hörten wir ‘Rikchen!. Rickchen!’ rufen. (Goethe
Corpus: Dichtung und Wahrheit (1811–1833), Hamburger Aus-
gabe, Band 9, S. 44)
	 ‘But at once we heard “Rikchen! Rickchen!” called.’
Indirect discourse is indicated in (336), while direct discourse marked by
quotations is reported in (337) and (338). In (335), we find an imperative,
which can also be considered a form of direct discourse because it appears
to be indicated verbatim by Kant. Because direct auditory perception is
the one type of evidence expressed in such constructions, the infinitive
complement is, as we can see, always a speech-act verb. After all, there
is no other way that spoken discourse can be acquired than through the
auditory perception of speech. It is clear that there are agents of speech
(i.e. direct objects) in these scenarios, but they are merely elided. Yet from
another perspective, we could perhaps view the discourse itself as a direct
object of sorts because it is, in a sense, also the object of perception. What
is excluded here is who is responsible for the utterance. This makes per-
fect sense when one considers that German tends to avoid double direct
objects, so what happens here is that the direct object – the agent of the
perceived action – is considered less relevant to the discourse and simply
not indicated.
A case where everyone involved in the speech situation is explicitly
indicated is exemplified by (339) below:
(339)	 ich hörte ihn einmal zu Charlotten sagen: ‘wenn uns nur Eduard
mitseinerFlötendudeleiverschonte!.eskanndarausnichtswerden
und ist für die Zuhörer so lästig’. (Goethe Corpus: Die Wahlver-
wandtschaften (1809), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 6, S. 329)
	 ‘IonceheardhimsaytoCharlotte:“IfonlyEdwardwouldspare
us from his flute tooting! Nothing can come out of it and it is
so annoying for the hearer”.’
Here, the speaker indicates from whom she heard the discourse (ihn, which
anaphorically refers to der Hauptmann ‘the captain’, who is mentioned ear-
lier in the text), and then she reports what he heard in the form of direct
164	 Chapter 3
discourse. In any case, the purpose behind such constructions appears to
indicate that there is direct auditory evidence for a chunk of discourse;
exactly who may be responsible for the utterance is deemed less important
and thus often omitted from the sentence altogether.
3.2.5  <PARENTH>
Hearsay evidence is the only type of evidence one finds among cases of par-
enthetical hören, as is also the case with evidential hear in English. As with
other cases of hearsay, the SP/W indicates that the reported information
has been auditorily perceived from a second-hand source, and this source
is almost always left unspecified in parenthetical constructions:
(340)	Wie ich höre sollen Iselins Umstände eben nicht außerordentlich
vorteilhaft seyn … (Kant Corpus: AA X, Briefwechsel (1776), S.
196)
	 ‘As I hear, Iselin’s condition is not supposed to be especially
favorable …’
(341)	 es ist mir gewissermaßen lieb, daß unser neuer Gast, wie ichhöre,
nicht lange bei uns verweilen wird … (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm
Meisters Wanderjahre (1829), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 8, S.
67)
	 ‘In a way, I prefer that our new guest, as I hear, will not stay
with us for very long.’
(342)	 Wie wir hören, hat Dr. Sigurd Ibsen – seine Einwlligung – zur
Verfilmung der Werke Henrik Ibsens – jetzt erteilt –. (DWDS
Corpus: ‘Theater und Musik’, in: Vossische Zeitung (Abend-
Ausgabe), 1.3.1913, S. 3)
	 ‘As we hear, Dr Sigurd Ibsen has now agreed to the filming of
the works of Henrik Ibsen.’
(343)	 Albert Bassermann – steht, wie wir hören, mit dem Berliner
Königlichen Schauspielhaus – in Verhandlungen, die dem Ab­­
schlußnahesind.(DWDSCorpus:(AlbertBassermannsteht…),
in: Vossische Zeitung (Abend-Ausgabe), 13.3.1917, S. 2)
Auditory Perception	 165
	 ‘AlbertBassermannis,aswehear,innegotiationswiththeRoyal
Theater of Berlin which are nearing conclusion.’
In (341), the fact that this is hearsay evidence is further emphasized by the
presence of the modal verb sollen ‘is supposed to’, which in its evidential
use can be glossed as ‘supposedly’, ‘reportedly’, or ‘allegedly’. There is also
a heightened sense of intersubjectivity here, as there is with other cases of
parenthetical constructions. The SP/W makes clear that s/he is the locus
of auditory perception, but that s/he may not be the only one who has per-
ceivedthereportingofinformationandthus,otherperceptionsorinterpre-
tations of the information in question may exist. The presence of the plural
pronoun wir simply indicates the SP/W has shared the perceptive act with
others – also an act of intersubjectivity – while continuing to acknowledge
a larger speech community. Regarding syntax, parenthetical constructions
are not considered part of the clause proper, but they nevertheless seem
to affect the evidentialized clause’s word order when they appear before
the clause. In (340) and (342), as we see, the conjugated verb immediately
follows the <PARENTH> construction. Given that German requires V2
word order in main clauses, it appears that the parenthetical is behaving as a
sentential constituent, which is less apparent in (341) and (343), where the
parenthetical constructions ‘interrupt’ the flow of the main clause and are
inasenseseparatedfromthisclauseviatheuseofpunctuation.Anin-depth
analysis of the syntax of parenthetical constructions will not be carried out
here, but readers are referred to papers in Dehé & Kavalova (2007) for a
variety approaches to such constructions. I merely wish to point out that
their syntactic status is not as clear cut as those constituents which we find
in other evidential constructions.
3.2.6  <EXT>
The data provide us with scant cases of evidential hören occurring external
to the clause over which the evidential meaning takes scope. I found a total
of two cases, one in the Bonner Corpus indicating inference based on the
166	 Chapter 3
content of auditorily perceived information (344), and one in the Goethe
Corpus marking direct discourse (345):
(344)	Daß ihr mit dem Æsculapio schlecht bekan-t seyd / das hoere
ich aus dem ungeschickten Urtheil. (Bonner Corpus: Text 147,
Christian Weise, Neue Jugend-Lust (1684), S. 151)
	 ‘That you are poorly acquainted with Æsculapio, that I hear
from the inept verdict.’
(345)	 sie schienen nicht sehr verwundert, aber ich war es, als Friedrike
Olivien ins Ohr sagte, so jedoch, daß ich’s hörte: ‘hab ich’s nicht
gesagt?. da ist er!’. (Goethe Corpus: Dichtung und Wahrheit
(1811–1833), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 9, S. 453)
	 ‘They didn’t appear very bewildered, but I was surprised when
Friedrike said into Olivien’s ear, so that Iheardit however: “But
I didn’t say? There he is!”.’
Example (344) is particularly interesting because it is the only case I found
where auditory perception leads to inference. Of course, it is not directly
what is perceived, but rather the content of what is perceived, that leads the
speaker to infer the addressee is mit dem Æsculapio schlecht bekan-t  ‘poorly
acquainted with Æsculapio’. And in (345), the speaker repeats verbatim
the discourse which he directly perceived when Friedrike was speaking
with Olivie. In both these cases, a deictic item is employed to point to the
discourse in question: the demonstrative pronoun das in (344) and an
enclitic pronoun (’s) in (345).
3.2.7  Summary of hören
The complementation patterns one finds occurring with evidential hören
attest almost parallel behavior than with English hear. For one, the <PV +
FCC> pattern is the primary way of marking hearsay evidence, and when
hearsay evidence is not marked, direct or indirect discourse is indicated.
Hearsay evidence can also be signaled by parentheticals, where it is the
only type of evidential meaning that can be understood. Direct auditory

perceptionisfoundalmostexclusivelyinthe<PV+DO+NFV>construc-
tion, although in German, only infinitive complements are to be found.
This leads to a wider variety of evidence indicated in constructions where
an infinitive is present. Besides direct auditory perception of an act, an
additional citation of direct or indirect discourse (with reference to the
act of perceiving the speech) can be indicated; and sometimes, the agent
of speech – who would appear syntactically as the direct object – is elided.
Occasionally the discourse, or at least the discourse content, functions as
a direct object, and the semantics of the clause are (due to the absence of
an agent) passivized. It is also not uncommon to find a direct object elided

3.3  sound
3.3.1  Quantitative Results
Our focus now shifts to object-oriented verbs of auditory perception,
sound being our representative from English. Although it occurs at a far
lesser frequency than hear, it is used evidentially a higher percentage of
the time than its subject-oriented counterpart. In the Helsinki Corpus,
there are only ten attestations of the verb sound, and only one (10%) of
these is a marker of evidentiality. In the ARCHER Corpus, however, there
are fifty-four cases of sound, twenty-two (40.7%) being used evidentially.
Aside from the one instance in the Helsinki Corpus, all cases of evidential
sound date from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A breakdown of
complementation patterns can be found in Table 7:

The one case in the Helsinki Corpus of evidential sound is in the <PV +
PPto> construction, whereas the ARCHER Corpus presents us primarily
with an adjectival complement appearing alongside the perception verb.
There are also a few cases of the Type VI construction, which also fails to
appear in the Helsinki Corpus.
3.3.2  <PV + PPto>
The one instance of evidential sound in the Helsinki Corpus occurs along-
side a prepositional phrase, and inference based on indirect auditory per-
ception is the type of evidential meaning expressed:
(346)	 And lykwyse yff therbe any thynge soundinge to your Grace’s
damage or hynderaunce iff I shold concele it; ther coud no pain
be to great for me. (Helsinki Corpus: CEOFFIC1, Cuthbert
Tunstall, Letter to King Henry VIII (1517))
As with several cases of hear, the content of what is heard – rather than
direct auditory perception – provides the evidence (or at least part of the
evidence) for what is asserted. In (346), Cuthberg Tunstall expressing his
willingness to conceal anything that ‘sounds to’ King Henry VIII’s ‘damage
Auditory Perception	 169
or hynderaunce’, i.e. Tunstall infers from the content of things he hears
whether or not this information could harm King Henry VIII’s image or
ability tocarryout hisagenda. The presenceoftheconditionalconjunction
yff is a bit problematic, for as we argued earlier, conditional semantics tend
to disallow evidential meaning because, after all, can evidential meaning
be expressed when the reality status of the evidence itself is in question?
That may well be the case here, although Tunstall employs the present
subjunctive (therbe) here rather than the past subjunctive, which anchors
the presence of things more in the world of the real than the irreal: Tunsall
probably believes there are indeed things in the real world that appear to
conflict with Henry VIII’s agenda, and should he come across these things,
he wouldn’t hesitate to conceal them. If we should not consider this a case
of genuine evidential meaning, then there are no cases of sound express-
ing such meaning in the Helsinki Corpus, and this is the closest thing to
evidential meaning that could be found.
3.3.3  <PV + ADJ>
This is the complementation pattern most often taken by evidential sound,
and similar to above, auditory perception provides the basis for SP/W
inference:
(347)	 Lung sounds normal over anterior chest; posteriorly, mucous
rales. (ARCHER Corpus: 1868curt.m6a, Hall Curtis, ‘Case
of Subacute Rheumatism, Combined with Chorea, Bronchi-
tis and Endocarditis’, Boston Medical and Surgical Journal 78,
pp. 309–11)
(348)	 Beatrice sounded sardonic. (ARCHER Corpus: 1977fras.f8b,
Antonia Fraser, Quiet as a Nun)
Whether or not the lungs are indeed functioning properly, and whether
or not Beatrice is sardonic, are not reported as certainty. Both cases are
based on inference via auditory perception. In (348), for example, direct
interaction with Beatrice and perception of her tone of voice and manner
170	 Chapter 3
of speech are what allow for such an inference. The adjectival complement
taken by sound can also be of a verbal nature:
(349)	 You sound disappointed, George. (ARCHER Corpus: 1922fagn.
d7b, James Bernard Fagan, The Wheel of Life)
(350)	 Robin sounded surprised. (ARCHER Corpus: 1957lark.f8b,
Philip Larkin, A Girl in Winter)
Similar to (347) and (348), auditory perception (probably through the
perception of tone of voice) provide the basis for inference here. Both a
passive and resultant semantics are to be found as well. That is, neither
George nor Robin are the agents of disappointment and surprise; these
actions have been done to them by someone else. And because of these
previous actions, George is now inferred to be in a state of disappoint-
ment, as Robin is to be in a state of surprise. These verbal complements
do not add any additional evidential meaning, but they do provide more
information about a scenario than a mere attributive adjective would. If a
present participle is used, the situation is a bit different:
(351)	 We areaware that Gladstoneatseventy-five hadnot completed his
second administration. He would not begin his third until he was
eighty-three. Churchill was seventy-five in 1949, eagerly awaiting
the recall to Downing Street, which did not come till two years
later. All that sounds very encouraging. But I am also aware that
of my dozen best friends at Oxford or just afterwards nine are now
dead. (ARCHER Corpus: 1981long.j8b, Lord Longford,Diary

Here, the information is deemed to encourage, and this state of encourage-
ment is presented as on-going/progressive (hence the present participle).

lightofinformationthatcarriesoppositeimplications.Inaddition,theexact
auditory nature of this evidence is unclear here. It certainly is not direct
perception as in the examples above. This is another case where the content
of what is perceived, rather than perception itself, provides the evidence.
Perhaps this information was initially acquired via auditory perception;
or, considering this is an excerpt from a diary (a text type that, although
written, can have a conversationl tone in the discourse), the writer wrote
as if  he were having a conversation, and thus the discussion of information
is perspectivized in an oral (auditorily perceivable) framework rather than
a written one. In any case, we are dealing with explicit linguistic informa-
tion as evidence, and sound indicates that this information was perceived
in some fashion, whether it was acquired through hearing or by some
other means.
3.3.4  <PV + {IC + ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}>
As with all other cases ofsound, auditory perception – or at least the evalu-
ation of what is auditorily perceived – serve as the basis of inference in this
construction type as well:
(352)	 That sounds to be a queer name of an army. (ARCHER Corpus:
1908yeat.d7b, William Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory, The
Unicorn from the Stars)
(353)	 She sounds a great darling and I am sure you are awfully good
with her. (ARCHER Corpus: 1952rhys.x8b, Jean Rhys, The
Letters of Jean Rhys, Eds Francis Wyndham and Diana Melly,
New York: Viking, 1984, pp. 95–6)
(354)	 She sounds a highly-strung creature … (ARCHER Corpus:
1975gray.d8b, Simon Gray, Otherwise Engaged: A Play)
In (352), direct auditory perception plays a greater role because the diction
and sound of the title (‘Unicorns’) is deemed to be ‘queer’ name, especially
when referring to an army. The content of perceived speech (i.e. descrip-
tions of the women in question), on the other hand, serves as the basis for
172	 Chapter 3
inference in (353) and (354). The elision of the copula in these two cases is
probably only a matter of writer preference or style and not this semantic
distinction because, after all, one could easily imagine She sounds to be a
highly-strung creature as a totally plausible and (grammatically) acceptable
utterance.5
3.3.5  Summary of sound
Similarly to the object-oriented visual perception verb look, sound appears
to be a marker of inferential evidentality based on auditory perception,
regardless of which construction it appears in. This inference can be based
on direct perception, or on the content of what is perceived, i.e. spoken
language.
3.4  (sich) anhören
The German anhören ‘listen, sound’ functions both as a subject-oriented
(355)andanobject-orientedperceptionverb(356).Whenusedasanobject-
oriented perception verb, anhören requires the presence of the reflexive
pronoun sich:
(355)	 Karen hört die Musik an.
	 ‘Karen is listening to the music.’
(356)	 Karen hört sich krank an.
	 ‘Karen sounds sick.’
5	 Granted, this only holds for cases where the semantic relationship between the sub-
ject and predicate is one of apparent category membership, i.e. isa ‘is an instance of ’
(Gisborne 1998: 6–7). Hence the questionable grammaticality of sentences such as
?She sounds to be happy or ?That sounds to be great.
Auditory Perception	 173
In (355), anhören indicates active, intended (agentive) perception on the
part of the grammatical subject and does not serve to indicate that there is
evidence for any sort of state or event being described. But in (356), we can
see that (sich) anhören is a carrier of evidential meaning only when used as
an object-oriented perception verb. Of course, not all object-oriented uses
of (sich) anhören are evidential:
(357)	 Die Musik hört sich laut an.
	 ‘The music sounds loud.’
Only an auditorily perceivable attribute of the music is described in (357);
evidential meaning is completely absent.
3.4.1  Quantitative Results
Appearances of evidential anhören in the corpora examined for this study
weresparseandveryfewinnumber.IntheBonnerCorpus,anhörenappears
only four times and it never expresses evidential meaning. The case is simi-
lar in the Kant and Goethe corpora, where anhören is attested thirty-two
times in the former and thirty-six times in the latter, never once serving as
a marker of evidentiality. And of forty-eight examples of anhören found in
the DWDS Corpus, four (8.3%) were found to function in an evidential
fashion. Three of these cases occur in the <PV + CONJ + C> pattern.
The other attestation is unique and does not fit the typology established
here at all.
3.4.2  <PV + CONJ + C>
All but one of the attestations of evidential (sich) anhören occur in the
<PV + CONJ + C> construction and signal the speaker’s inference that
a possible state of affairs is due to the semantic content of of perceived
discourse:
174	 Chapter 3
(358)	 Viele Unternehmen sind pleite, die Inflation steigt, und in Indo-
nesien haben manche Leute kein Geld, um Essen zu kaufen. :

Corpus: Christian Tenbrock, ‘Pflicht verletzt’, in: DIE ZEIT
(2.4.1998), S. 34)
	 ‘Many businesses are bankrupt, inflation is rising, and many a
person in Indonesia doesn’t have any money to buy food. That
soundsasiftheIWFistoblameforeverything,andtheaffected
states are the poor, innocent victims.’
Economictravailsareclearlynotauditorilyperceivablephenomena;instead,
discussionofthepoorfinancialsituationsofmanybusinessesandtheriseof
inflation leads the author to infer that the IWF isan allem schuld ‘to blame
for everything’, which is the state that is described in the subordinate clause
signaled by the phrasal conjunction als ob. Curiously, the information that
serves as the basis for the writer’s inference doesn’t appear to have been
heard at all because it is what the author describes right before making his
inference. Perhaps the author wishes to establish a conversational rapport
with his readership and (metaphorically?) impart the information as if it
were heard or being orally discussed. Using a verb of auditory perception
as an evidential marker would only emphasize this reader-writer relation-
ship. In any case, as was the case in (351) with sound, the information is
linguistic in nature, and indicating the manner in which it was perceived
is not the primary function ofanhören: rather, the writer’s response to this
information – the processing of evidence – is what is in focus.
3.4.2  Subject-Oriented anhören as an Evidential Marker?
The only other attestation of evidential anhören is unique in that it is actu-
ally a case of the agentive (not experiential, see Section 1.2.3) subject-ori-
ented use of this verb:
Auditory Perception	 175
(359)	 Wilhelm – dem man den ehemaligen Theologen ansah und vor
allemimVortrag anhörte –warallesanderealseintrockenerund
weltfremder Gelehrter … (DWDS Corpus: ‘Professor Richard
Wilhelm’, in: Vossische Zeitung (Sonntags-Ausgabe), 2.3.1930,
S. 3)
	 ‘Wilhelm, in whom you saw and, above all, heard the former
theologian during a lecture, was totally different from a dry and
quixotic scholar …’
Professor Wilhelm’s (visually and auditorily perceivable) mannerisms are
deemedbythewriteroftheVossischeZeitungsufficientevidencetocorrectly
inferthattheprofessorwasaformertheologian,andthisevidencewasavail-
able to all (thus the writer’s use of the indefinite pronoun man ‘one, you’
as the grammatical subject of perception). This is also the only instance of
evidential ansehen ‘see, look’ found in the examined corpora. So although
– as a general rule of thumb – agentive subject-oriented perception verbs
cannot signal evidential meaning, in some rare instances, they do.
3.4.3  Summary of anhören
Although attestations of evidential (sich) anhören are scant to say the least,
some observations can still be made. Like other object-oriented perception
verbs (look, aussehen, and sound) discussed thusfar, (sich) anhören’s sole
evidential meaning is that of inference based on perception. That is, the
content of what has been perceived (presumably by hearing, given that this
is a verb of auditory perception) serves as an inference for making further
conclusions. And when an entire sentence is conjoined to the matrix clause
containing (sich) anhören, the state or condition described in this sentence
is inferred to reflect reality, or at least to be a possible version thereof. There
was also a peculiar case of agentive subject-oriened anhören (and ansehen)
taking evidential meaning. Here too, inference based on perception is the
type of evidence involved.

3.5  klingen
3.5.1  Quantitative Results
Klingen is another object-oriented verb of auditory perception in German,
anditevincesahigherfrequencyofuseandgreaterconstructionalvariation
than anhören. But similar to anhören, the bulk of our data comes from the
DWDS Corpus, which further suggests that the evidential use of object-
oriented perception verbs is a recent historical development.6 Indeed, the
overall frequency of klingen is on the rise. The Bonner Corpus provides us
with three cases of klingen, none being evidential. Similarly, there are fifty-
one attestation of klingen in the Goethe Corpus, and here too, none are
evidential. In the Kant Corpus, a total of two (10%) out of twenty cases of
klingen evince evidential meaning. Much more can be found in the DWDS
Corpus, where eighty-one (17.1%) of the 475 examples of klingen are car-
riers of evidential meaning as well. Table 8 provides us with a breakdown
of the construction types in which evidential klingen occurs:

Auditory Perception	 177
Similar to other object-oriented perception verbs, complementation pat-
tern V is clearly the most numerically prominent. Types IV and VI can
also be found, albeit at lesser frequencies. And there is one nonce case in
the DWDS Corpus where klingen occurs in a construction external to the
clause containing the evidentialized information, a phenomenon virtually
unknown to object-oriented perception verbs.
3.5.2  <PV + PPnach>
When evidential klingen takes a prepositional phrase governed by the
preposition nach, the object of the preposition is inferred to exist, and this
inference is based – either directly or indirectly – on auditory perception.
Consider the following:
(360)	 Manche Zeitungen haben ja berichtet, daß es ein Bote des Grafen
Bernstorff–gewesensei,der,miteinemSchriftstückbewaffnet,die
Reise nach Mexiko – angetreten habe, und daß er auf dem Boden
der Vereinigten Staaten abgefaßt – worden sei; es klang schon
in den Meldungen nach Erfindung. (DWDS Corpus: Alfred
Gold, ‘Unterredung mit dem Grafen Bernstorff ’, in: Berliner
Tageblatt (Morgen-Ausgabe), 13.3.1917, S. 1–2)
	 ‘Some newspapers have reported that it was a messenger of
the Count Bernstorff who, armed with a written document,
embarked on the trip to Mexico and that he was caught on the
soil of the United States; it already sounded like fiction in the
reports.’
As with other cases of inference, hearing itself is not what forms the basis
of the evidence, but rather the evaluation of the content of what is heard
is what leads the writer to infer that the story concerning Count Bern-
storff ’s messenger is fiction. After all, fiction cannot be auditorily per-
ceived directly, and only the semantic content of perceived speech lends
itself to evaluation/verification. We are unaware of exactly how the writer
arrived at the stated inference (i.e. the line of reasoning is not elaborated
178	 Chapter 3
on in the discourse); we only know that the writer has deemed this story
to be Erfindung ‘fiction’ based on his intellectual reaction to the content
of what he perceived.
3.5.3  <PV + ADJ>
The type of evidence expressed byklingen in this complementation is simi-
lar to that in the <PV + PPnach> construction, that is, inference based on
the SP/W’s evaluation of the content of auditorily perceived discourse.
Rather than focus on a specific entity, which is signified by the noun in the
prepositional phrase discussed in Section 3.5.2, the SP/W infers about the
presence (or absence) of a certain attribute when evidential klingen takes
an adjectival complement. For example:
(361)	 Es klingt arrogant, selbstsüchtig und für die, welche ihrem alten
System noch nicht entsagt haben, verkleinerlich, zu behaupten:
daß vor dem Entstehen der kritischen Philosophie es noch gar
keine gegeben habe. (Kant Corpus: AA VI, Die Metaphysik der
Sitten (1797), S. 206)
	 ‘It sounds arrogant, egoistic, and for those who still have not
renounced their old system, condescending to proclaim that
philosophy didn’t exist at all before the development of critical
philosophy.’
(362)	 Ein Petersburger Blatt behauptet, Rußland habe Bulgarien
die Kriegsschiffe geschenkt, – eine Meldung, die freilich wenig
glaubwürdig klang, da Rußland selbst keinen Ueberfluß –
an brauchbaren Schiffen hat. (DWDS Corpus: (‘Die ganz
außerordentlich …’), in: Berliner Tageblatt (Morgen-Ausgabe),
3.3.1910, S. 1)
	 ‘A newspaper from St. Petersburg reports that Russia has given
Bulgariathewarships–areportthatadmittedlysoundedbarely
believable, given that Russia itself has no abundance of usable
ships.’
Auditory Perception	 179
In (362), the writer concludes that the report that Russia has given Bul-
garia warships is not very reliable. Whether the report is ultimately true
or not falls out of the purview of evidential klingen; the writer here merely
indicates that he deems the reported information to be of little reliability,
and in this instance, the reasons for the inference are stated explicitly, i.e.
knowledge of Russia’s lack of brauchbaren Schiffen ‘usable ships’. Interest-
ingly, this report is stated to emanate from a newspaper, which means the
writer could not have acquired the information via auditory perception.
However, as we already saw in our discussion ofsound(Section 3.4), object-
oriented verbs of auditory perception can be used to signal the acquisi-
tion of linguistic information, even when no act of hearing occurs. Here,
the writer – perhaps subconsciously – frames the discourse as if a spoken
dialogue is taking place (hence the hearing and sounding), even though
nothing more than the reading of a text may have occurred. The same can
be said of (361), where it is unclear whether Kant is responding to spoken
orwritten discourse. Inany case, klingenisa markerof evidentialitybecause
it is the linguistic item that indicates the SP/W’s inference in relation to
acquired information.
Sometimes klingen is used to express the inferential basis of an epis-
temic qualification (that is, evaluating the likelihood of the proposition
being true or not):
(363)	 Politiker war er nur sozusagen im Nebenamt. Aber das, was er
überdenGrundseinesVerkehrsmitdenKampfbündensagt,dieses
Bedürfnis,ihrenPlanzukennenundzwischensichereDämmezu
leiten, klingt sehr wahrscheinlich. (DWDS Corpus: ‘Der dritte
Kronzeuge’, in: Vossische Zeitung (Morgen-Ausgabe), 13.3.1924,
S. 1)
	 ‘Being in politics was only his secondary job, so to speak. But
whathesaysabouthisreasonsforfrequentingthebattleassocia-
tions, this need to know their plan and to lead through secure
channels sounds very plausible.’
The politician’s statement is reported to be true with a high degree of cer-
tainty (hence the epistemic adjectivewahrscheinlich ‘plausible, probable’),
180	 Chapter 3
and the perception verb klingen indicates that inference is the evidence
upon which this line of reasoning is based: the evidential marker makes
clear what the evidence is, and the epistemic marker signals the speaker’s
reasoning process in reaction to this evidence.
The adjectival complement taken by klingen can also be derived from
a verb, which we have seen contributes more than a mere description of
attributes to what is being evaluated:
(364)	 Eswarlustigundklangauswendiggelernt.(DWDSCorpus:Jürg
Federspiel, ‘Die Wespen’, in: DIE ZEIT (11.3.1966), S. 20–1)
	 ‘It was comical and sounded learned by heart.’
In this case, the perceived speech is inferred to be the present result of
previous actions, that is, the current speech is the result of learning and
memorizing that occurred in the past.
There are some problematic instances where there appears to be evi-
dential meaning, but this meaning becomes obviated by other parts of
the discourse:
(365)	 Mit der am kunsthistorischen Institut entwickelten Software
Imago werden Bilder, Texte und Töne auf einer multimedialen
Datenbank gespeichert, die dann quer durch alle Disziplinen und
frei für alle Assoziationen zur Verfügung stehen. Das klingt ein-
fach, ist aber angesichts einer disparaten, brutal unterbrochenen,
gespaltenen Geschichte mühselig und zeitraubend. (DWDS
Corpus: Petra Kipphoff, ‘Die Humboldts kommen!’, in: DIE
ZEIT (12.5.1999), S. 50)
	 ‘With the software Imago developed at the art history insti-
tute, pictures, texts, and sounds can be stored in a multimedial
database, which can then be available to all disciplines and free
for all assoications. That sounds simple, but in the face of a
disparate, brutally interrupted, divided history, it is laborious
and time consuming.’
Auditory Perception	 181
The author here infers that, at least in theory, the Imago software would
allowforeasycooperationbetweenvariousdisciplinesrelatedtoarthistory;
she then mentions, however, that the reality of politics at the art history
institute makes this anything but simple. So on the one hand, we have an
inference based on the semantic content of explicitly mentioned discourse,
but on the other hand, the result of this inference (the easiness of applying
Imago software) is deemed immediately not to be an accurate reflection
of reality. So do we consider this an evidential, given that the writer indi-
cates she knows reality to be otherwise than what might be suggested by
the evidence? For purposes of this study, I have decided to exclude cases
such as (365) from any quantitative results because any apparent evidential
meaningisnixedbyotherinformationthatisprovided:whatmayoriginally
appear as evidence providing the basis for a SP/W’s epistemology is over-
ridden by more pertinent or relevant information, and the item in ques-
tion loses its evidential meaning because it no longer provides the SP/W
with the evidence for the proposition that is ultimately asserted. Perhaps a
more clear-cut case of klingen (or any object-oriented perception verb for
that matter) not expressing evidential meaning is when a mere personal,
subjective value judgment is being expressed:
(366)	 lassenSieunsvomMenschenwürdigdenken,undbekümmernwir
uns nicht, ob es ein wenig bizarr klingt, was wir von ihm sagen.
(Goethe Corpus: Schriften zur Kunst (1816–1832), Hamburger
Ausgabe, Band 12, S. 86)
	 ‘Let us consider the man worthy, and we won’t worry ourselves
if it sounds a little bizarre what we say about him.’
In this case, klingen does not signal that Goethe is in possession of any
sort of evidence for making an assertion, but it merely indicates that he
deems what may be said about the man in question could seem strange.
After all, strangeness is not auditorily tangible, nor is it quantifiable; it is
a value judgment whose locus rests in each speaker’s individual tastes and
discriminations.
182	 Chapter 3
3.5.4  <PV + CONJ + C>
Inference based on what is perceived auditorily – either literally or meta-
phorically – is also the type of evidential meaning expressed by klingen in
the <PV + CONJ + C> construction. Only here, the content of an entire
proposition, as opposed to the presence or absence of a mere object or
attribute, is inferred to reflect reality, or at the least, to be a possible version
of reality. Hence the conjugated verb is almost always (if not always) found
in the subjunctive mood, as we have already seen with other perception
verbs occurring in similar constructions:
(367)	 Ihre Stimme klang, als müsse sie das Weinen gewaltsam unter-
drücken.(DWDS:H.v.Mühlau,‘DasWitwenhaus’,in: Vossische
Zeitung (Morgen-Ausgabe), 5.3.1908, S. 5–6)
	 ‘Her voice sounded as if she were having to violently suppress
her crying.’
(368)	 Das klingt ganz, als wenn der Vater singe. (DWDS Corpus:
L. Spitz, ‘Die Sängerfamilie von Milde’, in: Vossische Zeitung
(Morgen-Ausgabe), 7.3.1925, S. 12)
	 ‘That totally sounds as if the father were singing.’
Both (367) and (368) attest direct auditory perception serving as evidence
for the writers to infer that the state described in the following proposi-
tion is quite likely: that the woman is crying in (367) and that the father
is singing in (368). There is another type of construction that falls within
this pattern (attested seven times in the DWDS Corpus), and it involves
the elision of the verb in the second clause because it is – or would be – the
same verb used in the matrix clause. The conjunction wie ‘like’ is always
involved in this construction:
(369)	 An den Flüssen stehen: ‘das wird Frieden sein’, sagt die Fellfrau,
und der Flügelschlag eines Schmetterlings versöhnt mit dem
NaturschauspieldesKrieges.DasklingtwieeinSatzvonHandke,
der den Wiederholungszwang der Geschichte brechen will, das
GesetzderRache,desZahnumZahn.(DWDSCorpus:Thomas
Auditory Perception	 183
Assheuer, ‘Irrfahrt im Einbaum’, in: DIE ZEIT (29.4.1999),
S. 45)
	 ‘To stand by the rivers: “that will be peace”, says the fur-coated
woman, and the wing beat of a butterfly reconciles us with
the natural drama of the war. That sounds like a sentence by
Handke, who wants to break the compelled repetitiveness of
history, the law of revenge – tooth for a tooth.’
Inference is also involved here, for the speaker judges the expression in
(369) to emanate from the works of Handke, and this inference is based
on an evaluation of the semantic content of both the perceived expression
and the parallel expression the author has encounted in reading Handke’s
writings. Once again we find the content of the perceived discourse, rather
than perception itself, providing the writer with the informational basis
for the inference.
3.5.5  <EXT>
I found one peculiar instance of evidential klingen appearing in a clause
external to the evidentialized information. In this instance,klingendirectly
points to and specifies the source of previously stated information:
(370)	 UndSiesinddochStiller;wirjedenfalls, dieBehörden,behandeln
Sie als den, für den wir, die Behörden, Sie halten – so etwa geht
das zweite Stiller-Echo dieses Schweizer Buchherbstes. Es klingt
aus dem Bericht Double des 54jährigen Genfers Daniel de Roulet
… (DWDS Corpus: Andreas Isenschmid, ‘Stillers Kinder’, in:
DIE ZEIT (8.10.1998), S. 15)
	 ‘And yet you are Stiller; we the authorities, in any case, will
treat you as the one who we the authorities consider you to
be – thus goes the second Stiller-Echo of this Swiss book fair.
This comes from the 54-year old Genevan Daniel de Roulet’s
report Double …’
184	 Chapter 3
The information source here is specified as de Roulet’s report, and this is
achieved by klingen and the discourse pronoun es, whose antecedent is
the semantic content of what was previously spoken. It is unlikely that the
information in this report was acquired via auditory perception, so this is
another case where klingen assumes a metaphorical coloring for present-
ing non-spoken discourse as if it were, in a sense, delivered in an auditorily
perceivable medium. Barring (370), such an <EXT> use of evidentials is
unknown to object-oriented perception verbs.
3.5.6  Summary of klingen
Klingen is German’s key carrier of evidential meaning among object-ori-
ented verbs of auditory perception, in contrast to the much lesser used
(sich) anhören. When taking a prepositional phrase or an adjective as a
complement, klingen signifies that the speaker has inferred that the object
of the preposition or the attribute indicated by the adjective exists in real-
ity, and this inference is based on the evaluation of the semantic content
of discourse that has – either literally or metaphorically – been perceived
via auditory perception. When a conjunction such as als joins klingen
with an entire clause, the semantic content of the entire clause is inferred
to reflect reality, or at the very least, be a possible version of reality. If the
conjunction wie joins the two clauses, the inference is much the same as it
is with prepositional and adjectival complements. And the one <EXT>
use of klingen I found worked in tandem with a discourse pronoun (es) and
functioned as a marker of information source in the discourse.
Auditory Perception	 185
3.6  Chapter Summary
The data reveal that verbs of auditory perception in both English and
German do not exhibit the degree of polysemy in regard to evidential
meaning when compared with the verbs of visual perception discussed in
Chapter 2. With the subject-oriented perception verbs hear and hören,
hearsay evidence is exhibited by the <PV + FCC>, <PV + WH-CC>
and <PARENTH> constructions, whereas direct auditory perception is
to be found primarily when the <PV + DO + NFV> complementation
pattern is used. Furthermore, direct and indirect discourse can be speci-
fied by clauses that follow the <PV + DO + NFV> construction. <EXT>
constructions, although sparsely attested, can express both hearsay and
direct auditory evidence.
Regarding the object-oriented perception verbs sound, (sich) anhören,
and klingen, similar conclusions can also be drawn. In every construction
type these verbs appear in, the only type of evidential meaning one finds
is inference based either on direct auditory perception or on the semantic
content of what was perceived (the latter is more often the case). This holds
regardlessofwhetherthereisaprepositionalcomplement(<PV+PP>),an
adjectivalcomplement(<PV+ADJ>),aconjoinedclause(<PV+CONJ+
C>), or a copular complement (<PV + {IC + ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ
+ N}>). And given that almost all attestations of evidential object-oriented
auditory perception verbs date from the twentieth century (a phenomenon
similar to the object-oriented visual perception verbs), it appears that this
use of object-oriented verbs is a more recent historical development than
the evidential use of subject-oriented perception verbs.
Chapter 4
Tactile Perception
We now turn our attention to tactile perception, or sense of touch. Inter-
estingly, the two verbs under examination here – English feel and German
fühlen – indicate literal tactile perception only seldomly when function-
ing as evidential markers. Instead, these verbs are far more prone to focus
on internal states of the speaker such as intuition, emotion, and belief as
evidence for the propositions under evaluation. And although both these
verbs can function as subject-oriented and object-oriented verbs, this dis-
tinction is almost impossible to make here because the subject and object
of perception are often synonymous, i.e. the SP/W.
4.1  feel
4.1.1  Quantitative Results
In the Helsinki Corpus, there are a mere forty-one attestations of the verb
feel, three (7.3%) serving as carriers of evidential meaning. The ARCHER
Corpus provides us with more data: 675 cases of feel with 133 (19.7%) being
usedevidentially.Evidentialfeelistheoneverbthatatteststhewidestvariety
of complementation patterns, and this is no doubt due to its ability to serve
as both a subject-oriented and object-oriented perception verb (although,
as I just pointed out, this distinction is often less important because the
speaker is simultaneously the subject and object of perception). The break-
down of construction types can be seen in Table 9:

high degree of usage. Types III and VI enjoy moderate usage, while Types
II, VII, VIII, and IX constructions are used only sparingly.
4.1.2  <PV + FCC>
I found only one example in the corpora where literal tactical perception
served as evidence in this complementation pattern:
Tactile Perception	 189
(371)	 By my trouth gammer me thought your neele here I saw / But
when my fyngers toucht it, I felt it was a straw. (Helsinki Corpus:
CEPLAY1B, William Stevenson, Gammer Gvrtons Nedle
(1500–1570), p. 15)
Inferential meaning is also present here, for the speaker infers from tac-
tile perception that the object being touched is straw and not something
else. Vision would have provided more immediate and confirmatory evi-
dence that what was being touched was indeed straw, but with feeling,
the conclusion is more tentative because tactile perception is simply a less
reliable source of information than visual perception. Thus the evidence
provided by this sensation is less global, and thus not as likely to express
absolute certainty on the part of the speaker. This can also be said of the
more prominent types of evidence expressed in this construction type:
emotion, intuition, and/or personal belief. The focus is not on physical
tactile perception at all, but rather on an internal mental or emotive state
of the SP/W:
(372)	 Now minx, I feel that I have the truth; and I feel a violent desire
to make you feel this cane. (ARCHER Corpus: 1786cowl.d4b,
Hannah Cowley, A School for Greybeards)
(373)	 On the sudden, a faint and feeble moan pierced my ear; instinc-
tively I moved the branches at my side, and at the foot of a rude
stone-cross beheld a desolate infant, unnaturally left to perish in
thewilderness!Itwasfamishing–expiring.Iraisedittomybreast,
anditslittlearmstwinedfeeblyroundmyneck.Florian!thouwert
heaven’s gracious instrument to reclaim a truant to his duties!
Welcome! I cried to thee, young brother in adversity! – ‘thou art
deserted by thy mortal parents, and my heavenly father has for-
saken me!’ From that moment I felt I had a motive left to cher-
ish life, since my existence could be useful to a fellow-being – my
wanderings finished, and I settled in Alsace. (ARCHER Corpus:
1809dimo.d5b, William Dimond, The Founding of the Forest)
(374)	 And I own that I feel that it is impossible that the Lord should
damn me, and how can I be humble before God when I tell him
190	 Chapter 4
that I expect from him eternal bliss as the reward of my life here
on earth. (ARCHER Corpus: 1876trol.x6b, Anthony Trollope,
The Letters of Anthony Trollope, vol. 2: 1871–1882, ed. John Hall,
Stanford: Stanford University Press, pp. 554–5)
(375)	 I feel that a great deal of my illness and weakness is caused by
loneliness and worry and that it would do me all the good in the
world to see you. (ARCHER Corpus: 1963rhys.x8b, Jean Rhys,
TheLettersofJeanRhys,EdsFrancisWyndhamandDianaMelly,
New York: Viking, 1984, pp. 95–6)
The line between intuition and belief is often difficult to pinpoint in such
cases. In (375), for example, does Rhys express her firm belief that her poor
healthisdueto‘lonelinessandworry’,ordoesshemerelyintuitthis?Perhaps
her intuition forms the basis of this belief state, and the two cognitive proc-
esses are no longer distinguishable. Emotion appears to play a significant
role in (373), where the writer’s discovery of an abandoned child obviously
causes an visceral reaction, although one cannot exclude shades of intui-
tion and belief forming part of the evidence here as well. If the modal verb
can appears alongside feel (there is one such attestation in the ARCHER
Corpus), a modal flavoring of ability is added, and as with other cases of
this modal verb taking scope over the perception verb, evidential meaning
continues to be expressed:
(376)	 I could detect no change in her voice, no sharpness, no undue curi-
osity, but I could still felt [sic?] that she was watching me and not
her washcloth. (ARCHER Corpus: 1951marq.f8a, John Phillips
Marquand, Melville Goodwin, USA)
The writer here indicates he was able to intuit that he was being watched,
and although one would expect the infinitive form of the verb feel in this
construction, the writer uses the simple past instead (this is possibly a
mere typo).
I found one instance where the modal verb can and the perception
verb feel failed to signify evidential meaning, but this was because of the
conditional semantics attached to the modal verb:
Tactile Perception	 191
(377)	 It broke my heart to leave the girl but I could feel comparatively
easy now if I could feel that she had good friends. (ARCHER
Corpus: 1896cran.x6a, Stephen Crane, Stephen Crane: Letters,
Eds Stallman & Gilkes, New York: New York University Press,
1960, pp. 134–5)
Since could here(inbothinstances,thesecondonebeingthe<PV+FCC>
construction under discussion) appears with irrealis semantics, the state of
ability (and hence of perception) is marked as irreal and hypothetical, and
hence not existing in the present reality. And since this evidence is irreal,
there is a lack of existing evidence to describe any current state of affairs.
But here in (377), the entire scenario is described as only hypothetical: the
irreality is not limited to the modal verb alone. With the other case ofcould
feel in (377), there is not even the possibility of evidential meaning because
only the (internal) emotive state of Stephen Crane is in focus, rather than
how this emotive state forms the basis of the Crane’s evidence.
Thepresenceorabsenceofthethat-complementizer,atleastinthedata
discussed here, appears to play no role in exactly what type of evidential
meaning is expressed by feel.
4.1.3  <PV + WH-CC>
The single case of feel in this construction also exhibits speaker-internal
evidence, and literal touching is not involved at all:
(378)	 I felt what manner of spirit they were of; and had sweet fellow-
ship with them, and strong consolation. (ARCHER Corpus:
1744wesl.j3b, Charles Wesley, Charles Wesley’s Second Journey,
In The Wesleys in Cornwall, ed. J. Pearce)
Here, Charles Wesley is discussing the disposition of a congregation to
whom he was preaching, and because he perceived internally that they
had a good spirit, he was able to join in fellowship with them. Of course,
external evidence is present here, insofar as Wesley was able to witness the
192	 Chapter 4
congregation’s behavior and mannerisms, but felt in (378) points to his
internal response to what was witnessed, and not the observation of the
congregation itself.
4.1.4  <PV + DO + NFV>
4.1.4.1  Infinitive
Literal tactile perception, whether it be felt externally or internally (in
a bodily rather than a mental sense), is the type of evidence one finds
expressed when the <PV + DO + NFV> construction takes an infinitive
as the non-finite verbal complement:
(379)	 And I feel my Fit of Trembling come upon me … (ARCHER
Corpus: 1706pix-.d3b, Mary Pix, The Adventures in Madrid, In
The Plays of Mary Pix and Catharine Trotter, vol. 1, ed. Edna L.
Steeves, New York: Garland, 1982)
(380)	 The Swelling in his Groin very much increased; the Inflammation
decreasing,Ifelt Mattertofluctuate,butdeep;theTumornotvery
painful. (ARCHER Corpus: 1735gool.m3b, Samuel Goolden,
‘A Gangrene Flopped by the Cortex Peruvianus’,Medical Essays
and Observations, vol. III, pp. 35–43)
In (379), the perceived fit of trembling is no doubt felt internally, whereas
the ‘matter’ in (380) is perceived externally. In addition, the infinitive par-
ticle to is present in (380), although it is unclear what if any semantic effect
this has on the infinitive (such a use is now archaic). There are also a few
cases where the tactile sensation is metaphorical in nature:
(381)	 When I tell her I am pregnant, she says she will come on Monday.
I feel a great weight lift from my shoulders as I hang up the phone.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1978ryan.j8a, Margaret Ryan, Pregnancy
Journal,InAriadne’sThread:ACollectionofContemporaryWom-
en’s Journals, ed. Lyn Lifshin, New York: Harper & Row, 1982)
Tactile Perception	 193
So in (381), for example, the removal of an emotional burden is described
in terms of a heavy weight that is physically perceivable. This is not the
same type of metaphorical meaning expressed when feel signals intuition
or belief, but rather, the actual sense of touch remains present here; it is
only that the objects involved are not physically tangible and the described
perceptionoftheirpresenseisconsequentiallymetaphorical.Butevenhere,
we are dealing with evidence of direct perception and not, as is the case
with feel in the <PV + FCC> or <PV + WH-CC> patterns, intuition,
emotion, or belief serving as the basis for the existence of some other event
or state. The evidence here remains within the immediate perceptual act. I
did, however, find one case wherefeel conveyed more of a sense of intuition
or emotion as evidence for the proposition that fell within its scope:
(382)	 Trying so hard to stay in control; even as I am trying, no control
of my life, feeling it all get out of hand. (ARCHER Corpus:
1978wein.j8a, Bibi Wein, Diary, In Ariadne’s Thread: A Collec-
tion of Contemporary Women’s Journals, ed. Lyn Lifshin, New
York: Harper & Row, 1982)
Direct tactile perception, neither in a literal nor metaphorical sense, can
serve as evidence that one’s life is spinning out of control, so here we are
left with the more metaphorical sense of feel where intuition and/or emo-
tion serve as the writer’s evidence for indicating that things are getting
‘out of hand’.
There is one instance in the ARCHER Corpus where the cognitive
verb think makes the presence of the tactile sensation a bit more tentative
without abolishing it completely:
(383)	 This solitary inn would be a lovely spot to cut a poor devil’s throat
in. I’ll lay a wager there are trapdoors in every floor. Ah! I thought
I felt it shake under my feet. (ARCHER Corpus: 1862brom.d6a,
John Brougham, The Duke’s Motto, or I am Here, In America’s
Lost Plays, vol. 14, ed. Eugene Page, 1941)
194	 Chapter 4
Thespeakerisonlysomewhatcertainhefelttheshaking,andthereforequal-
ifies his statement with the cognitive verb to make the assertion of evidence
more tentative. But he certainly is more certain than not about his percep-
tions, or else he would have negated the description of the perceptual act or
omitted it from the discourse completely. There is still evidential meaning
here; its force is only more tentative here because the carrier of evidential
meaning, the perception verb feel, falls within the scope of think.
4.1.4.2  Present Participle
Literal tactile sensation can also be indicated when a present participle is
used. Only here, as with all other verbs that have taken present participle
complements in this construction type, there is the progressive aspectual
coloring:
(384)	 On pressing my hand firmly to the part affected, Ifelt wind rolling
under it. (ARCHER Corpus: 1820thom.m5b, Charles Thomas,
‘Case of Accidental Poisoning with Corrosive Sublimate’,Edin-
burgh Medical and Surgical Journal 16)
And similar to (381), the direct tactile sense of feel is capable of taking a
metaphorical interpretation as well:
(385)	 Whan I remembre what incomparable goodnes hath euer pro-
ceded of this vertue beneuolence, mercifull god, what swete flauour
fele I persing my spirites, wherof bothe my soule and body to my
thinkinge do conceyue suche recreacion, that it semeth me to be in
a paradise, or other semblable place of incomparable delites and
pleasures. (Helsinki Corpus: CEEDUC1A, Thomas Elyot, The
Boke Named the Gouernour (1531), p. 149)
Activity in the spiritual realm is described as if it were occurring in the
physical realm, and the evidence the writer gives for his spiritual bliss is
provided within the metaphorical framework of tactile perception.
Tactile Perception	 195
4.1.4.3  Past Participle
Literal tactile perception is not to be found when a past participle occurs
as the non-finite verbal complement in the <PV + DO + NFV> construc-
tion. Rather, the metaphorical senses of emotion and intuition are what is
expressed here, and described events are always passivized:
(386)	 After he preached – by invitation, I preached, & was assisted in
speaking & felt my soul enlivened while describing the loveliness
of Jesus & the happiness of those who love the Blessed Saviour.
(ARCHER Corpus: 1790hill.j4a, William Hill, Extracts from
the Journal of William Hill, Virginia, 1790–1791, In Religion on
the American Frontier, vol. II: The Presbyterians, W. W. Sweet,
New York, 1936)
The enlivening of the soul here is solely an emotional event with no direct
bearing on the physical realm of tactile perception, and who exactly is
responsible for this emotional inspiration of the speaker’s soul is obscured
by the passive semantics indicated by the past participle. There also can be
an additional resultant meaning indicated when the focus is on a current
state or event that is the result of previous actions (in contrast to (386),
where the event is described in a passive sense):
(387)	 With regard to your kind and never to be forgotten loan, I feel
myselfboundnotonlybylaw,butbyhonor,torepayitatthebegin-
ning of the year, if you require it. (ARCHER Corpus: 1834disr.
x5b, Benjamin Disraeli, Benjamin Disraeli Letters: 1815–1834,
Eds J. A. W. Gunn et al., Toronto: University of Toronto Press,
1982, pp. 431–2)1
1	 The argument could be made to include this in the <PV + ADJ> complementation
pattern discussed below since the past participle functions much as an adjective here.
To do so would certainly not be incorrect, but given the presence of the prepositional
phrases by law and by honor, which mark the instruments of action here, as well as the
196	 Chapter 4
The law and honor are the external forces indicated as the agents of bind-
ing in this example, or at least the forces that compel the writer to make
good his financial obligations. The reflexive pronoun myself appears as the
direct object here because the speaker is describing himself as the patient
of an action (binding). And feel indicates more than emotion here because
the speaker is indicating his belief about his financial obligations. Indeed,
feel is capable of signaling intuitive, emotive, and epistemic evidence (i.e.
belief) simultaneously.
4.1.5  <PV + ADJ>
When evidential feel takes an adjectival complement, the presence of the
attribute signified by the adjective is believed or intuited by the SP/W to
exist:
(388)	 I feel myself wrong, yet have not courage to amend. (ARCHER:
1799dunl.d4a, William Dunlap,False Shame, In America’s Lost
Plays, vol. II, ed. Barrett H. Clark, Princeton, NJ: Princeton
University Press, 1940–1942)
In(388),thespeakerbaseshisassertationthathehastreatedhiswifewrongly
on personal belief and/or intuition. It is not uncommon to find a participle
behaving adjectivally in such constructions, indicating present states that
have resulted from previous actions:
(389)	 Often, perhaps too often, we have lately, felt called upon to state
our impressions with regard to the vote by ballot, and once more
weareboundtodeclarethecontinuedbiasofourjudgmentagainst
thatplausible,butinefficientanddisgraceful,andifnotinefficient,
arguable function of the reflexive pronoun myself as a direct object, I have decided
to include (387) in the <PV + DO + NFV> category.
Tactile Perception	 197
most dangerous and immoral measure. (ARCHER Corpus:
1833tim1.n5b, The Times)
(390)	 But there was an attractive power about this poor Irish girl that
fascinatedmestrangely.Ifeltirresistiblydrawntoher.(ARCHER
Corpus: 1872kilv.j6b, Francis Kilvert,Kilvert’s Diary, vol. II, ed.
W. Plomer)
So in (390), the writer possesses some unspecified internal sensation (most
likely emotive) that makes him attracted to the Irish girl. Or put another
way, the Irish girl’s ‘attractive power’ exerts some sort of magnetic alluring
power over the writer, and feel is only his way of linguistically expressing
that what he perceives is genuine evidence.
I found six cases (two presented here) in the corpus where an infini-
tive immediately followed the deverbal adjectival complement, and in
these cases, the SP/W indicates that s/he is in possession of evidence that
influences further action:
(391)	 We feel, therefore, obliged to declare that we make all reserves and
decline all responsibility for the consequences which might befall
Germany if, despite the greatest exertion of Germany’s powers, the
conditions proved impossible of fulfilment. (ARCHER Corpus:
1919dai2.n7b, Daily Herald)
(392)	 I feel inadequate to speak of his ‘loving and giving’ along with
a gaiety of spirit that made light all the trouble he was taking,
the time we were taking, or the way he brought life and energy
into a room with him – ‘comfort and joy.’ (ARCHER Corpus:
1976horn.j8b, Joyce Horner, That Time of Year: A Chronicle of
Life in a Nursing Home)
In(391),thewriterindicatessomeexternalforcedriveshimto‘feel’obliged,
and this obligation compels the speaker to engage in further action related
to thisadjectival attribute,namely aformaldeclaration concerning the eco-
nomic state of Germany. In (392), the adjective inadequate has the opposite
effect and will more likely cause intertia rather than action. That is, because
the writer feels inadequate, she will probably not speak at all.
198	 Chapter 4
There are also ten cases of the adjective followed by a complementizer
clause, and when this occurs, the SP/W uses the adjectival complement
to specify the evidential nature of feel and how this relates to the semantic
content of the proposition found in the complementizer clause:
(393)	 I will pay you the compliment, Falcon, to say, that I feel convinced
that the masts of this ship are as secure as knowledge and attention
can make them. (ARCHER Corpus: 1834disr.x5b, Benjamin
Disraeli, Benjamin Disraeli Letters: 1815–1834, Eds J. A. W.
Gunn et al., Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982)
(394)	 But I still feel fairly sure that he is not the Russians’ man, as he
wascreditedwithbeingduringthecivilwar.(ARCHERCorpus:

lectedEssays,JournalismandLettersofGeorgeOrwell:1945–1950,
vol. IV, Eds Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus, Boston: Cavid R.
Godine, 1968)
In (393), Disraeli indicates that he has been convinced (present resultant
state) of the proposition’s semantic content, i.e. the integrity of the ship’s
masts. Similarly in (394), Orwell expresses his belief in the accuracy of the
following proposition. Belief and intuition are the two types of evidence
expressed by feel in such constructions. One could perhaps create a new
construction type category that accounts for this data: <PV + ADJ +
CC>. This would certainly be plausible, but given that there are so few
attestations in the corpora and that this construction was found only to
occur with feel, I have simply subsumed this syntactic constellation under
the <PV + ADJ> rubric.
4.1.6  <PV + CONJ + C>
If evidential feel finds itself followed by a phrasal conjunction and a clause,
then the belief or intuition expressed by feel are evidence for a possible
state of affairs:
Tactile Perception	 199
(395)	 He is not generally rash, so I suppose knows what he is about, but
we feel as if he is already separated from us entirely. (ARCHER
Corpus:1863holm.j6a,EmmaHolmes, TheDiaryofMissEmma
Holmes, ed. John F. Marszalek, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State
University Press, 1979)
(396)	 IfeelasifI’dbeenherebefore.(ARCHERCorpus:1971mich.f8a,
James A. Michener, The Drifters, New York: Randomhouse)
In (396), the speaker cites his intuition as evidence for claiming that it is
possible he already had been in his current location prior to the speech
event. Whether he really has or not is another question; the point of this
construction is to indicate that there is evidence for a possible state of such
affairs, which may or may not turn out to be indicative of reality.
4.1.7  <PV + {IC + ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}>
Similar to several other constructions, feel here indicates the speaker intuits
or believes a certain attribute or entity to exist:
(397)	 … yet so benignly unassuming, that my shyness all flew away, &
I felt to be his confidential Friend, opening to him upon every
occurrence, & every sentiment, with the frankness that is usually
won by years of intercourse. (ARCHER Corpus: 1812simm.j5b,
George Simmons, A British Rifle Man, ed. W. Verner)
The writer here indicates that her intuition and/or belief lead her to con-
clude she is the confidante of the man she is describing. This is the only
such attestation for feel found in corpora.
4.1.8  <PARENTH>
If evidential feel occurs in a parenthetical function, it is also a marker of
the SP/W’s belief or intuition:
200	 Chapter 4
(398)	 She is the only thing I feel keeps me alive, for she alone wants
me really. (ARCHER Corpus: 1863qvic.x6b, Queen Victoria,
Dearest Mama: Private Correspondence of Queen Victoria and
the Crown Princess of Prussia, 1861–1864, ed. Roger Fulford,
London: Evans Brothers Limited, New York: Holt, Rinehart,
and Winston, 1968, pp. 198–9)
(399)	 That is, as I feel now, it seems to me impossible that I should
remain much longer. (ARCHER Corpus: 1896fred.f6a, Harold
Frederic, The Damnation of Theron Ware, or The Illuminaton)
But unlike other parentheticals, there is little or no intersubjective func-
tion to parenthetical feel. That is, in both (398) and (399), only the SP/W’s
viewpoint – without regard to anyone else’s – is put forward. This is no
doubt due to the highly subjective nature of feel being a marker of personal
belief or intuition. Whereas parenthetical see or hear are indicators of more
global perception (i.e. the things being perceived are not perceivable to the
SP/W alone), parenthetical feel functions only to mark the perception of
the perceiver because, after all, one’s personal feelings cannot be felt by
anyone other than the self. Consequently, intersubjective meaning is less
likely to appear. In (399), there is intersubjective meaning, but this is due
more to the presence of the object pronoun me and the evidential seem, not
the perception verb feel. The speaker indicates he infers that he will not be
able to stay much longer, but he does acknowledge this is indeed his assess-
ment with me. And feel points to the speaker’s feelings as the basis for this
inference. Others may well feel differently about the situation, but this is
not as clear as when see or hear are used parenthetically, which always seem
to point to other possibilities of evidence and interpretation.
4.1.9  <EXT>
An internal state of the speaker is also in focus when feel occurs external
to the proposition for which it is to function as the intuitive, emotive, or
epistemic evidence:
Tactile Perception	 201
(400)	WINTER: Old Honesty! Ecod, ye mistake the matter, young gen-
tleman; I am an old go-between!
	 CHEVERIL: Ha! ha! ha!
	 WINTER: Oh! you may laugh – but <its varra it is very true:
and I begin to feel it – a helpless child has been cast <upo’> upon
the wide wide <warld> world, by a <hairtless fayther> heartless
father, and I am a part <o’> of the cause. (ARCHER Corpus:
1819beaz.d5b, Samuel Beazley, The Steward: or, Fashion and
Feeling: A Comedy, in Five Acts)
(401)	 He’ll be famous some day. I can feel it. (ARCHER Corpus:
1938mccr.d7b, Esther McCracken, Quiet Wedding)
In (400), the speaker indicates that he believes he is partly responsible for
the poor treatment of ‘a helpless child’, and he cataphorically uses the pro-
noun it to point forward to the information for which feel indicates there
is personal, internal evidence. In (401), the speaker uses belief and intuition
as the bases for making a prediction about the future, and the presence of
the modal verb can to emphasize the ability to ‘feel’ strengthens the force
of the prediction. Here, the pronoun functions anaphorically by pointing
back towards an already made statement.
4.1.10  Summary of feel
With the exception of occurring with an infinitive or present participle as
the non-finite verbal complement in the <PV + DO + NFV> construc-
tion, evidential feel is not a marker of literal tactile perception. Instead,
the speaker’s own intuition, emotions, and belief state form the basis of
evidence indicated in all other complementation patterns. And it is often
difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between intuition and belief
when attempting to pinpoint exactly what type of evidence the speaker is
attempting to convey with evidential feel. This ambiguity allows speakers
to avoid specifying whether they arrived at the information ‘on a hunch’
or through a process of deductive reasoning.

4.2.1  Quantitative Results
Evidential fühlen is attested in all German language corpora except the
Bonner Corpus (there are ten non-evidential attestations of fühlen here).
The Kant Corpus has a total of 522 cases of fühlen, twenty-seven (5.2%) as
markers of evidential meaning. The Goethe Corpus provides us with the
greatest number and variety of evidential constructions involving fühlen:
104(10.6%)of985casesoffühlenareevidential.AndintheDWDSCorpus,
of a total 1,009 examples of fühlen, twenty-eight (2.8%) signaled some sort
of evidential meaning. The frequency of attested complementation pat-

All corpora reveal a preference for the <PV + ADJ> construction when
fühlen is used evidentially. The <PV + FCC> pattern also enjoys a relative
high degree of usage, whereas the <PV + WH-CC>, <PV + DO + NFV>,
<PARENTH>, and <EXT> constructions are used far more sparingly.
4.2.2  <PV + FCC>
No cases of the <PV + FCC> construction in the German language cor-
pora attest the use of fühlen to mark literal tactile perception as evidence.
Instead, the evidence expressed by fühlen in this complementation pattern
is internal in nature: as was the case with English feel, inuition, emotion,
and belief serve as speaker evidence when German fühlen is involved as
well. Consider the following:
(402)	Ich fühle selbst, daß ich hier nicht füglich das Wort: rechtfertigen
brauchen kann: aber was ist zu thun? (Kant Corpus: AA XI,
Briefwechsel (1789), S. 118)
	 ‘I myself feel that I am not able to use the word “justify” ade-
quately: but what is there to do?’
(403)	ja, ich fühle, man könnte hier verweilen, ruhen, alles mit den
Augen fassen, sich glücklich finden und ganz etwas andres fühlen
und denken als das, was vor Augen steht. (Goethe Corpus: Wil-
helm Meisters Lehrjahre (1795–1796), Hamburger Ausgabe,
Band 7, S. 542)
	 ‘Yes, I feel one could linger here, rest, grasp everything with the
eyes, feel happy, and think and feel something very different
from that which stands before one’s eyes.’
(404)	Denn er glaubte fest an die Seelenwanderung, wenn es auch nicht
‘die alte gute biedermännische Lehre davon’ war. Aber ich fühle,
daß Wahrheit dahintersteckt, wie hinter anderen Religionen und
Mythologien. ��������������������������������������������
(DWDS Corpus: L. Andro, ‘�������������������
Briefe an eine Ver-
storbene’,in:VossischeZeitung (Abend-Ausgabe),14.3.1917,S.2)
204	 Chapter 4
	 ‘For he firmly believes in transmigration, even if it was not from
“the good old Philistine teachings”. But Ifeel that there is truth
behind it, as in other religions and mythologies.’
Thus in (402), tactile perception is not what forms Kant’s belief that he is
incapable of using the word rechtfertigen ‘justify’ adequately (how could
it be?); rather, Kant metaphorically employs fühlen to indicate belief and/
or intuition are what drive him to make this assertion.
There is one instance in the Goethe Corpus in which the modal verb
können appears alongside evidential fühlen:
(405)	wie ich an Deinem Herzen habe fühlen können, daß Du in Liebe
bist, so ergreife ich auch den glänzenden Gedanken … (Goethe
Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (1795–1796), Hamburger
Ausgabe, Band 7, S. 66)
	 ‘As I could feel from your heart that you are in love, so I also
grasp the splendid thought …’
Again, speaker intuition or belief – rather than tactile perception – serves
as evidence for the assessment that the addressee is in love. And the modal
verb simply contributes the flavoring of ‘ability’ to the semantics of fühlen
without eliminating the evidential meaning. The use of the modal verb
können alongside a perception verb is not as common in German as in Eng-
lish, but when it does occur, the modal meaning of ability is expressed.
4.2.3  <PV + WH-CC>
As with the <PV + FCC> construction, the use of evidential fühlen with
a wh-complementizer clause is an indicator of internal evidence:
(406)	nur fühlte ich, was ich schon oft bemerkt habe, auf das lebhaf-
teste: Leute von einigem Stande werden sich immer in kalter
Entfernung vom gemeinen Volke halten, als glaubten sie durch
Tactile Perception	 205
Annäherung zu verlieren … (Goethe Corpus: Die Leiden des
jungen Werther (1774), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 6, S. 10)
	 ‘I just felt what I already often noted in the most lively way:
people of a certain standing will always keep themselves at a
cold distance from the common people, as if they believed they
would lose by approaching others.’
(407)	Aber ich fühle, wie ein mächtiger Haß in mir aufsteigt. (DWDS
Corpus: Felix Hollaender, ‘Die Briefe des Fräulein Brandt’, in:
Berliner Tageblatt (Morgen-Ausgabe) 3.3.1918, S. 5)
	 ‘But I feel how a powerful hate is rising up in me.’
In (406), personal belief and/or intuition serve as evidence, and the infor-
mation left unspecified by was ‘what’ is indicated later in the discourse.
Emotion plays a prominent role in (407), in which the writer senses the
emergence of a particular emotion: hate. There is one instance wherefühlen
indicates external tactile perception, but only in a metaphorical sense:
(408)	Wir–sindnichtalsSchmetterlingegeboren.WirsitzenimSumpf
undfühlen,wiewirfettwerden.–ErschloßdieAugenundversank
inTrauer.(DWDSCorpus:OttoAlfredPalitzsch,‘Janbemüht
sich’, in: Vossische Zeitung (Morgen-Ausgabe) 5.3.1927, S. 10)
	 ‘We are not born as butterflies. We sit in the quagmire and feel
how we become fat. He closed his eyes and sank into dolor.’
Unfortunately, the DWDS Corpus fails to provide the larger context of
this passage, but from what we have, we can infer that although there is a
colorful description of the weighing down effects of quagmire (which can
be perceived externally), this passage refers more to detrimental effects of
sadness, and the mentioning of the quagmire serves as a literary device.
Within its construction, fühlen appears to refer to literal, external tactile
perception, but within the larger text, the quagmire (and consequently
fühlen) are to be understood metaphorically.

4.2.4  <PV + DO + NFV>
4.2.4.1  Infinitive
I found only one case of evidential fühlen taking a direct object and an
infinitive complement, and here, physical tactile perception is involved
only insofar as it provides the source domain of a metaphor:
(409)	und es hätte mir wohl kein größeres Glück begegnen können, als
daß ich nach dem schrecklichen Kriegs-_wesen und Fluchtwesen
endlich wieder fromme menschliche Sitte auf mich einwirken
fühlte. (Goethe Corpus:Campagne in Frankreich(1822), Ham-
burger Ausgabe, Band 10, S. 344)
	 ‘I could not have experienced greater good fortune than after
the horrors of war and flight, I finally felt pious human customs
influencing me again.’
There is certainly a sense of touch here, but it lies outside the physical
domain and rather in the world of aesthetic influences. Here, Goethe con-
veys an image of these influences as ‘touching’ him, but it is clear that a
physical sense of tactile sensation is not involved.
4.2.4.2  Past Participle
As above, tactile perception can be gleaned from the semantics of fühlen
in this construction when a past participle is present, in that this tactile
sensation is metaphorical in nature:
(410)	 nur wenn wir ins Chor treten, wo das Vollendete uns mit über-
raschender Harmonie anspricht, da erstaunen wir fröhlich, da
erschrecken wir freudig und fühlen unsere Sehnsucht mehr als
erfüllt.(GoetheCorpus:SchriftenzurKunst(1816–1832),Ham-
burger Ausgabe, Band 12, S. 180)
Tactile Perception	 207
	 ‘Onlywhenwestepintothechoir,wherethatperfectionappeals
touswithsurprisingharmony,thenwearejoyfullyamazed,then
we are gladly shocked and feel our desire more than fulfilled.’
The fulfilling of desire is clearly something that is not perceivable via tactile
means, although here, it is metaphorically described in such terms. And as
with other cases of past participle complements, there is a passive sense to
the action because the agent is obscured from the discourse.
4.2.5  <PV + ADJ>
When evidential fühlen takes an adjectival complement, the existence of
the state or attribute signified by the adjective is intuited or believed by the
speaker to exist, and the adjectival complement is most often times a past
participle. Fühlen is also obligatorily reflexive in this construction:
(411)	 Dieser zweifelnde Gedanke störet die Ruhe, in die ich mich gegen-
wärtig versezt fühle. (Kant Corpus: AA X, Briefwechsel (1783),
S. 358)
	 ‘This doubting thought is destroying the peace into which I
currently feel placed.’
(412)	 ich habe diese Tage Ihres Hierseins immer gehofft, durch vertrau-
liche Erzählung Trost zu gewinnen, aber ich fühle mich übler
gestellt als vorher … (Goethe Corpus: Wilhelm Meisters Wan-
derjahre (1829), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 8, S. 433)
	 ‘I was hoping during these days of your presence and to gain
consolationthroughintimateconversation,butInow feelworse
off than before.’
(413)	 Wir fühlen uns verraten und verlassen. (DWDS Corpus:
Birgit Cerha, ‘Eine Stadt in Angst und Elend’, in: DIE ZEIT,
17.10.1997, S. 13)
	 ‘We feel betrayed and abandoned.’
208	 Chapter 4
Thesameresultantandpassivesemanticsevincedbypastparticiplecomple-
ments are also present here, and although reflexive pronouns appear in all
theseexamples,thesearenotcasesofthe<PV+DO+NFV>construction.
After all, the use of a reflexive pronoun is obligatory in this construction
and should not be analyzed as a genuine direct object (as can be seen, for
example, in Ich fühle den Wind ‘I feel the wind’).
There are several cases (three in the Kant Corpus, eight in the Goethe
Corpus, and five in the DWDS Corpus) in which the adjectival comple-
ment is followed by a clause that further modifies the particulars of the
attribute or state under discussion:
(414)	 Ich fühle mich nun mit neuen Kräften gestärkt, der Wahrheit
nachzuforschen … (Kant Corpus: AA XI, Briefwechsel (1789),
S. 68–9)
	 ‘I feel myself strengthened with new powers to search for the
truth …’
(415)	 von solchen Studien bildender Kunst fühle ich mich denn doch
gedrungen wieder zum Theater zurückzukehren und über mein
eigenes Verhältnis an demselben einige Betrachtungen anzustel-
len, welches ich erst zu vermeiden wünschte. (Goethe Corpus:
Campagne in Frankreich (1822), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 10,
S. 356)
	 ‘Yet through such studies of educational art Ifeel compelled to
return to the Theater and to initiate some conversations about
my own situation, which I initially wished to avoid.’
(416)	 Wenn ich aber das SPD-Programm sehe, fühle ich mich gera-
dezu verpflichtet, meiner alten Partei den Rücken zu stärken.
(DWDS Corpus: (‘WORTE DER WOCHE …’), in: DIE
ZEIT, 27.8.1998, S. 4)
	 ‘But when I look at the SPD agenda, I feel obligated to
strengthen the back of my old party.’
So in (415), Goethe finds himself in a current state of feeling compulsion,
and this compulsion is to return to the theater. As we saw in the English
Tactile Perception	 209
data, the state or attribute indicated by the adjective entails some sort of
further action, and this action is specified by the following clause.
The presence of negation plays an interesting role in the <PV + ADJ>
construction because the negator sometimes annuls any possible evidential
meaning,whileatothertimes,itsimplymodifiestheadjectivalcomplement
without affecting the evidential status offühlen. All of this depends on the
status of the adjectival complement. Consider the following:
(417)	 ich fühle mich nicht stark genug, dir länger zu widerstehen.
(Goethe Corpus: Die Wahlverwandtschaften (1809), Ham-
burger Ausgabe, Band 6, S. 256)
	 ‘I don’t feel strong enough to resist you any longer.’
(418)	 Im übrigen erweisen wir uns als nicht empfindlich bei allem,
was uns typisch andorranisch erscheint. Wir fühlen uns nicht in
der Arbeit gestört, wenn ein Maulesel in endlosen hysterischen
Anläufen an ein und demselben Schrei zieht … (DWDS Corpus:
Marieluise Fleisser, ‘Andorranische Erinnerungen’, in: Vossische
Zeitung (Abend-Ausgabe), 2.3.1932, S. 7–8)
	 ‘Incidentally,weproveourselvesnottobesensitivetoeverything
that appears typically Andorian to us. We don’t feel disturbed
in our work when a mule makes one and the same scream in
endless hysteric attempts …’
In (417), it appears that evidential meaning continues to be expressed by
fühlen in spite of the negator. After all, the speaker assesses that, based
on intuition and/or belief, she does not have the strength to resist the
addressee: these internal ‘feelings’ still provide the evidence for the assess-
mentthatthere isalackofstrength(absence oftheattribute signaledbythe
adjective). But in (418), the negator does away with all possible evidential
meaning because here all that is being indicated by the writer is that she and
those she was with do not feel disturbed. This disparity can be explained
by the nature of the adjectival complement. In (417), the adjective is a
genuine adjective and not derived from some other linguistic item (such
as a verb). In (418), however, the adjective is derived from a past participle,
and its negation signals complete lack of the attribute via nonaction (i.e.
210	 Chapter 4
there has been no disturbing on the part of anyone), whereas negation of
a ‘pure’ adjective appears to indicate the absence of an attribute (i.e. lack
of strength). And the SP/W indicates there is evidence of this lack when
fühlen is used. Of course, the presence of the adverb genug ‘enough’ frame
the relative presence or absence of strength as scalar rather than either-or.
But even if it were only the case of an adjective (i.e. Ich fühle mich nicht
stark), the speaker would nonetheless be in posession of internal evidence
for her current state of being. We made a similar observation in Section
2.3.3 regarding evidential look.
4.2.6  <PARENTH>
Only two instances of parenthetical fühlen are attested in the corpora, and
in one case, literal perception is involved. The other attestation involves the
indication of an emotional state. Cases of parenthetical fühlen signaling
the speaker’s inuition or belief are not attested in the German language
corpora. The two instances of parenthetical fühlen are:
(419)	 … daß sie mit Anstrengung auf irgend ein Object (wie oben bei
krampfhaften Zufällen) gerichtet und dadurch das Ausstoßen der
Luft gehemmt wurde, welches mir, wie ich es deutlich fühlte, das
Blut ins Gesicht trieb … (Kant Corpus: AA VII, Der Streit der
Fakultäten (1798), S. 111)
	 ‘…thatitisdirectedatsomeobjectwitheffort(likeaboveunder
spasmodic conditions) and became inhibited through the dis-
charge of air, which as I clearly felt, drove my blood into my
face …’
(420)	Schon werde ich, ich fühle es, ruhiger. (DWDS Corpus: Ernst
Weiß, ‘Männer in der Nacht’, in: Vossische Zeitung (Morgen-
Ausgabe), 6.3.1925, S. 10–11)
	 ‘I’m already becoming, I feel it, calmer.’
In (419), physical tactile perception provides Kant with the evidence to
assessbloodflow,whereasin(420),theperceptionisfocusedonaninternal
Tactile Perception	 211
emotional state and not on external tactile sensation. Example (420) is
interestingbecause,unlikemostotherparentheticalswehaveexaminedthus
far, it is not introduced with a conjunction such as wie. In fact, it contains
the pronoun (es) that we often find in <EXT> constructions, and it almost
behaves as such because it points at another proposition, and indicates
there is evidence for this proposition. I have included it here, however,
because it occurs in the same position as parentheticals (i.e. it ‘interrupts’
the linear flow of another clause), and not external to the clause altogether
– the distinguishing feature of <EXT> constructions.
4.2.7  <EXT>
When occurring in constructions external to the evidentialized clause,
fühlen tends to signal intuition and belief on the part of the SP/W:
(421)	 ichwerdeihmfolgen,undbaldfolgen,ich fühl’ es,undeswirdmir
soleichtumsHerz.(GoetheCorpus:WilhelmMeistersLehrjahre
(1795–1796), Hamburger Ausgabe, Band 7, S. 591)
	 ‘I will follow him and soon, I feel it, and my heart is getting
very light.’
(422)	meine Uhr ist noch nicht ausgelaufen, ich fühle es! (Goethe
Corpus: Die Leiden des jungen Werther (1774), Hamburger
Ausgabe, Band 6, S. 99)
	 ‘My time hasn’t run out yet, I feel it!’
The speakers here bases their assertion not on anything they can feel, but
rather on their intuitive assessment of the situations in question.
4.2.8  Summary of fühlen
Intuition and belief are what SP/Ws indicate when they use fühlen eviden-
tially. Literal tactile perception is still to be found, only far less frequently,
and for the most part, in less prominent construction types. Whereas
212	 Chapter 4
intuition and belief are marked as source of evidence in the <PV + FCC>,
<PC + WH-CC>, and <PV + ADJ> complementation patterns, literal
tactilesensationoccursmoreoftenin<PV+DO+NFV>,<PARENTH>,
and<EXT>constructions.Andevenhere,metaphoricalextensionsmaybe
used, so we can conclude that instances of purely physical senses of ‘touch’
are rare indeed when dealing with evidential fühlen.
4.3  Chapter Summary
Both English feel and German fühlen rarely display the semantics of lit-
eral tactile perception as a type of evidence, although fühlen appears to
do so more often – and in more construction types – than English feel.
Both languages employ this evidential perception verb primarily to signal
emotion, inuition, and/or belief (internal ‘feelings’) as the evidence for
what is asserted. The most frequently used construction types here, <PV
+ FCC> and <PV + ADJ>, evince not a single use of the feel or fühlen in
its original sense of tactile sensation. And even when these verbs are used
as such, the external perceptive event is often metaphorical in nature, i.e.
physicaltouchingonlyprovidesthesourcedomainforthemetaphor.These
verbs have heretofore been the most semantically bleached of their original
meaning when employed as markers of evidential meaning.
Chapter 5
Olfactory and Gustatory Perception
The final two sensory modalities – those of smell (olfaction) and taste (gus-
tation)–arethefocusofthischapter.Bothmodalitieswillbeaddressedhere
because of the scant amount of data that could be found for each modal-
ity in both English and German. Evidential meaning is indeed attested,
albeit infrequently. English smell and German riechen cover olfactory per-
ception, while English taste and German schmecken represent gustatory
perception.
5.1  Olfactory Perception
5.1.1  smell
In the Helsinki Corpus, there are a total of twenty attestations of smell,
one (5%) of which may be evidential. The ARCHER Corpus provides us
with twenty-eight cases of smell; none of these, however, signal evidential
meaning. The one arguable case of evidential smell in the Helsinki Corpus
involves the <PV + ADJ> complementation pattern, and the evidential
meaning is not self-apparent because of the ambiguity of the adjective
involved:
(423)	 Furthermore all wines that smell well and are redish yellow, so
muchasisoftheirnaturealtogither,theytroubletheheadewhena
manisvexedwithbothkindesofswounding…(HelsinkiCorpus:
CEHAND1B, William Turner, A New Boke of the Natures and
Properties of All Wines (1568), pp. C7R–C7V)
214	 Chapter 5
The problem here is that well could denote the evidential meaning where
the smell of the wine is evaluated to determine if the wine is good (well)
or not, but well could also denote a mere value judgment on the part of
the writer, whereby the wine is deemed pleasing to smell. If the latter
should be the case here, evidential meaning is not expressed. Perhaps
shades of both meanings are here, in which case smell would be consid-
ered only partly evidential. In any case, (423) is not a clear case of smell
functioning as a marker of evidential meaning, but it is the closest thing
that could be found in the corpora. I did find some cases of evidential
smell documented in the OED. Unlike in (423), where physical olfactory
perception is involved, these cases feature smell used in a metaphori-
cal sense to indicate suspicion on the part of the SP/W. That is, SP/Ws
indicate they sense the existence of a certain entity or state of affairs, and
much like English threaten (see Section 1.1.2.2), this perceived existence
is viewed as negative:
(424)	Me thinketh this smelleth like a lye. (OED: North, Plutarch,
Artaxerxes (1896), VI. 112)
(425)	 It’s … the whole set-up … It doesn’t smell right. (OED: J. Tey, To
love & be Wise (1950), xvii. 219)
(426)	There’s a wrong slant to this affair. I can’t put my finger on it but
it smells. (OED: H. Howard, Highway to Murder (1973), viii.
103)
In (424), the speaker uses the perception verb to indicate they sense the
presence of misinformation (the cognitive verb think weakens the force of
the assertion), while in (425) and (426), a general state of affairs is deemed
to be out of order. Olfactory sense is involved in none of these cases, but a
general, non-modal specific sense of perception is, and it is expressed meta-
phorically by smell. These are, after all, cases of object-oriented smell, so the
focus here is on some attribute of the perceived object leading the SP/W to
infer the presence or absence of a specific attribute, or in more global cases,
an entire state of affairs. There are also a few evidential idioms involving
smell, i.e. constructions that allow the SP/W to articulate their inference
using a set phrase. I smell a rat is probably the most well-known evidential
Olfactory and Gustatory Perception	 215
idiom involving smell, and here, the SP/W indicates s/he perceives that
something is not as it should be, and this perception is expressed in quite
negative terms via postulating a (metaphorical) rodent as the object of
perception. There is also the lesser known – and perhaps obsolete – idiom:
to smell of the candle/lamp/oil/etc., whereby the SP/W indicates that some
characteristicofaperceivedlinguisticexpressionordiscourseisinauthentic
and shows ‘signs of being laboured and artificial’ (OED):
(427)	At times he wrote stories unworthy of him. At times his work
smelled ofthelamp.(OED:Glasworthy, CastlesinSpain (1927),
p. 154)
The inference based on the perception that these stories are ‘laboured and
artificial’ is expressed with the verb smell and the prepositional phrase of
the lamp, and it is the type of prepositional complement – apparently one
having to do with a source of light for reading or writing – for the speaker
to infer that what is being read is inauthentic.
5.1.2  riechen
Evidential uses of riechen, German’s primary verb of olfactory perception,
are also scantily attested in the corpora. There are no attestations of eviden-
tial riechen in either the Bonner Corpus (fourteen non-evidential attesta-
tions), the Kant Corpus (twenty-two non-evidential uses), or the Goethe
Corpus (seven non-evidential uses). In the DWDS Corpus, however, nine
(13.8%) of sixty-five attestations of riechen were carriers of evidential mean-
ing. All of these occurred in the <PV + PPnach> construction, and as is the
case with English smell, literal perception is not to be understood:
(428)	Aber diese Strecken wirken dazwischengeklebt, sie riechen nach
Alibi, so als dürften die modebewußten Mädels erst wieder lei-
denschaftlich für die Sommerfarbe Grau oder den Lidschatten in
Gold entbrennen, wenn sie sich zuvor dem Leid der Welt ausge-
216	 Chapter 5
setzt hätten. (DWDS Corpus: Barbara Sichtermann, ‘Immer
blöder’, in: DIE ZEIT (20.5.1998), S. 54)
	 ‘But these routes appear bonded together there, they smell like
alibi, just as if the fashion-conscious girls were only enthusing
for the summer color grey or golden eye shadow if they had
previously been exposed to the sorrow of the world.’
An alibi clearly cannot be perceived through smell, but here, the writer
expresses her inference that an alibi exists through the metaphorical use
of riechen. And this is the case with all other uses of riechen in the <PV +
PPnach> construction. Literal olfactory perception plays no role; after all,
smell cannot even provide the basis for inference in such cases. This evi-
dential use of riechen is purely metaphorical.
5.2  Gustatory Perception
5.2.1  taste
We now turn our attention to taste, English’s most frequently used verb
of gustatory perception. Although the Helsinki Corpus attests nineteen
cases of taste and the ARCHER Corpus provides us with forty-five exam-
ples of this verb, none of these evince evidential meaning. I was, however,
able to find one case in the OED where taste functioned as a marker of
evidentiality:
(429)	Nay, then I taste a Trick in ’t. (OED: B. Johnson, Devil an Ass
(1616), I. vi)
Similar to the above cases involving olfactory perception, this is a meta-
phorical use of the perception verbtaste because physical gustatory percep-
tion is not and cannot be involved. The perception verb is used to indicate
Olfactory and Gustatory Perception	 217
inference on the part of the SP/W, and the specific sensory modality which
drives this inference is left unclear. Gustatory perception only provides the
source domain for the metaphor.
5.2.2  schmecken
Cases of evidential schmecken are also low in number. The Bonner Corpus
provides us with fifteen attestations of schmecken, the Goethe Corpus fea-
tures forty-five examples of schmecken, yet neither of these corpora pro-
vide us with any evidential uses. The Kant Corpus shows only one (4%)
of twenty-five cases of schmecken as an evidential marker. The DWDS
Corpus provides us with the greatest number of evidential cases: eight
(11.8%) of sixty-eight attestations. The one evidential riechen in the Kant
Corpus appears in the <PV + PPnach> complementation pattern, while
seven (87.5%) of eight DWDS Corpus examples appear in this pattern as
well. The one other case in the DWDS Corpus involves the <PV + ADJ>
construction.
When used evidentially, riechen behaves much like schmecken, insofar
as SP/Ws use it as an indicator of inferential evidence rather than literal
perceptual evidence:
(430)	Den Vertretern der auswärtigen Presse hatte die Theaterleitung
die Gelegenheit, der geschlossenen Vorstellung beizuwohnen, und
gegeben. Das schmeckt nach – Zensur. (DWDS Corpus: (F.E.),
‘Die geschlossene Vorstellung’, in: Berliner Tageblatt (Morgen-
Ausgabe), 6.3.1929, S. 4)
	 ‘Theater management had given the representatives of the for-
eign press the opportunity to attend the closed performance.
That tastes like censorship.’
(431)	 Die Krise der Stella-Musicals zeigt, was auch für die Urban
Entertainment Center gilt: daß zuviel Kunstwelt schnell kün-
stlich schmeckt. (DWDS Corpus: Hanno Rauterberg, ‘Es lebe
der Budenzauber’, in: DIE ZEIT (11.3.1999), S. 33)
218	 Chapter 5
	 ‘The crisis of the Stella musicals shows what also holds for the
Urban Entertainment Center: that too much of the world of
art quickly tastes artificial.’
Neither censorship nor artificiality possess qualities perceptable via taste,
so here we find more metaphorical uses of a verb low in the perception verb
hiearchy (see Section 1.2.2) to function as a marker of SP/W inference. I
also found one instance in the DWB of evidential riechen in an <EXT>
construction, and here too, inference and not literal perception is what is
expressed:
(432)	 sie ist ein kuplerin, ich schmecks. (DWB: Opel-Cohn, 105, 28)
	 ‘She is a pander. I can taste it.’
As with many other cases of <EXT> evidentials, there is a discourse pro-
noun (here the enclitic –s (<es) on schmecks) that points to the proposition
for which the SP/W has evidence.
5.3  Chapter Summary
Verbs of smell and taste, the two sensory modalities at the bottom of the
perception verb hierarchy, are seldom used as markers of evidentiality.
And when they are, SP/Ws frequently employ them metaphorically to
signal inference rather than literal olfactory or gustatory perception. And
although literal uses are not attested in the corpora, they are conceivable
(e.g. I smell the cake burning, Ich schmecke, dass es Ingwer in der Suppe gibt
‘I can taste that there’s ginger in the soup’, etc.) and no doubt appear in
usage.
Conclusion
I hope this study has shed some light on how perception verbs can signal
evidential meaning. It has certainly confirmed certain aspects of earlier
research on perception verbs. For example, the quantitative data alone
support the perception verb hierarchy established by Viberg (1983): verbs
of visual perception (Chapter 2) enjoy the highest frequency of usage (in
both their non-evidential uses and in the variety of evidential meanings
they express), verbs of auditory perception (Chapter 3) are next, then come
the verbs that signify tactile perception (Chapter 4), and lastly we have
the verbs of olfaction and gustation (Chapter 5). The degree of polysemy
found among the evidential uses of perception verbs confirms the claims
of Sweetser (1990: 23–48) and Harm (2000), for the bases of evidential
meanings (e.g. direct perception, knowledge, understanding, inference,
intuition) can also be expressed by perception verbs in their non-evidential
uses. For example, in the sentence I see your point, the perception verb see
means ‘understand’, and understanding and knowledge are also a type of
evidencethat see canindicatewhenusedevidentially.Thisstudyalsoreveals
that more polysemy can be found – at least insofar as evidential meaning is
concerned–amongsubject-orientedperceptionverbsthanobject-oriented
perception verbs. In addition, English and German, the two languages
under consideration in this study, display a remarkable similarity in how
their verbs of perception are used evidentially. English hear and its German
counterpart hören,forexample,expressthesameevidentialmeaningswhen
they occur in the same complementation patterns. Differences do exist
(e.g. the use of the present participle in English but not in German in the
<PV + DO + NFV> construction), but overall, the evidential uses of the
perception verbs in English and German are very similar.
This study also has shed light on what type of constructions/comple-
mentation patterns evince evidential uses of perception verbs, and what
types of evidential meaning are bound to certain constructions. Regarding
220	 Conclusion
the subject-oriented verbs of visual perception (see and sehen), the <PV
+ FCC> construction attests a variety of evidential meanings: direct per-
ception, general observation, inference, knowledge, and understanding.
The case is similar with the <PV + WH-CC> construction. The <PV
+ DO + NFV> complementation pattern, on the other hand, is almost
solely a marker of direct visual perception as evidence, although a general
sense of observation can also be indicated. Parenthetical constructions
(<PARENTH>) are solely markers of internal mental states – namely,
knowledge and understanding – while <EXT> constructions can display
a large variety of evidential meaning involving both visual perception and
more metaphorical senses of internal mental states. The object-oriented
visual perception verbs (look and aussehen) only indicate inference based
on vision when used evidentially, regardless of whether they occur in the
<PV + PP>, <PV + ADJ>, <PV + CONJ + C>, or the <PV + {IC +
ADJ; (IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}> construction.
Thesubject-orientedverbsofauditoryperception(hearandhören)can
indicate not only direct auditory perception, but also first-hand received
informationandhearsayastypesofevidence.Theyalsocanmarkauditorily
perceived speech as direct or indirect discourse. When appearing in the
<PV + FCC> or <PARENTH> constructions, they are almost always
markers of hearsay evidence. But similar to visual perception, the <PV +
DO + NFV> constructions allow these verbs to indicate direct auditory
perception as evidence; direct and indirect discourse can also be marked
as what was heard. <PV + WH-CC> and <EXT> constructions display
varied meanings here as well. The object-oriented verbs of auditory percep-
tion (sound, (sich) anhören, and klingen) are, like their visual counterparts,
limitedtoexpressinginferenceinalloftheirconstructionalmanifestations:
<PV + PP>, <PV + ADJ>, <PV + CONJ + C>, and <PV + {IC + ADJ;
(IC) + N; (IC) + ADJ + N}>.
The verbs of tactile perception under examination ( feel and fühlen)
often indicate that intuition and/or belief are evidence for the SP/W’s

tions are more prone to indicate these ‘feelings’ as evidence, while cases of
literal, external tactile sensation are rare.
Theverbsofolfactoryandgustatoryperception(taste,schmecken,smell,
and riechen) provide us with very few evidential uses. Direct perception as
evidence is never attested in the corpora (although it is possible); rather,
we find these verbs expressing a general sense of inference, often with a
metaphorical sense of perception added to the verb, e.g. I’m smelling a rat
or Das schmeckt nach Zensur ‘That tastes like censorship’. Not all cases
found here necessarily are part of the typology of evidential perception
verbs established in Chapter 1 because they sometimes only take a direct
object (I’m smelling a rat) or they take no complements at all (It smells).
Equivalent evidential constructions were not found among the other sen-
sory modalities, at least as far as the corpora are concerned.
English and German perception verbs occupy a very interesting posi-
tion within the domain of evidentiality. For one, they are still full lexical
itemsthatinmostcaseshaveyettoundergoaprocessofgrammaticalization
(theseeingconstructioninEnglishbeingoneexception).Ontheotherhand,
the fact that certain evidential meanings can be bound to particular com-
plementationpatternsrevealsthatsomethingisgoingonaboveandbeyond
the word level: the development of constructional meaning, although not
necessarily a case of grammaticalization in this instance, indicates that SP/
Ws find a need for the systematic organization of the linguistic realization
of the evidence for the propositions they put forward. The fact that varying
degrees of (inter)subjectivity can also be linked to particular constructions
further indicates that not only do SP/Ws wish to systematically express
what types of evidence they have for their assertions, but also what the
nature of this evidence is as it relates to themselves and others. No doubt
the rich polysemy afforded to perception verbs aides in this task, allowing
for a single perception verb to be used to express a wide variety of evidence
accompanied by varying degrees of (inter)subjective meaning.
Several questions regarding perception verbs and evidential meaning
still need to be answered. Most immediate to the focus of this study is the
need to examine the evidential uses of perception verbs in other Germanic
languages, as well as how the non-modal specific perception verbs (e.g.
perceive, wahrnehmen) can be used evidentially. More broadly, the study
222	 Conclusion
of perception verbs as markers of evidential meaning in non-Germanic
languages is also necessary. Indeed, the role of perception in general as it
relates to the acquisition and linguistic expression of evidence has yet to
be addressed significantly in the scholarship on evidentiality and eviden-
tial meaning.
There has been much discussion concerning the relationship between
evidentiality and (epistemic) modality, but proper attention has yet to be
given to the interplay between these two domains. I briefly touched on
this issue when discussing the occurrences of the modal verb can/können
with evidential perception verbs, but this is a far cry from any systematic
study of the interplay between these two elusive semantic (and sometimes
grammatical) categories. What this study does reveal is that when percep-
tion verbs signal evidential meaning, epistemic modality appears not to
be involved, for it is the nature of the evidence – rather than suppositions
resulting from a reaction to the evidence – that is signaled by the percep-
tion verb. The one exception is when inference is indicated: although even
here, the likelihood of the proposition being true or not, which is the focus
of epistemic modality, is not in question; rather, that the inference (the
basis of which may or may not be made explicit in the discourse) serves
as adequate evidence for the uttered proposition is what is made explicit.
Indeed, the role of inference in epistemic modality versus its role in evi-
dentiality is a topic in need of further discussion.
The diachronic development of evidential meaning also warrants
attention. In this study, I set out to begin this endeavor by drawing on
data from the Early Modern and Modern periods. But very few changes
have occurred during this time; no new evidential meanings appear to
have arisen within the last 500 or so years, at least as far as the data in this
study are concerned. This probably has to do with the perception verbs in
general: the degree of polysemy expressed by these verbs is not a product
of the (Early) Modern period and dates back much earlier, arguably even
to Indo-European. The only notable historical development I could find
here is the increasing use of object-oriented perception verbs as evidential
markers, although here too, this use is not unknown in the Early Modern
Period. Perhaps studies of perception verbs and/or evidential meaning in
the Older Germanic dialects such as Old English or Old High German
Conclusion	 223
would provide a more historical overview of this dilemma. Rodríguez &
Contreras (2001–2002), for example, have examined the evidential uses of
ongitan ‘perceive’ in Old English. And I did find a few cases of evidential
Old English heoran ‘hear’ in the OED. For example:
(433)	 Hyrde ic æt he one heals-beah Hyde esealde. (OED: Beowulf
(1000), l. 2173)
	 ‘I heard he presented the necklace to Hyde’.
These observations are admittedly far from providing a complete descrip-
tion of evidentiality in Old English, but they do at least show that such
historical examinations are promising, if not to say necessary. The relation-
ship between human perception and linguistic realizations of evidential-
ity is no doubt an area that offers us many provocative avenues for future
research.

German Linguistic and Cultural Studies
Edited by Peter Rolf Lutzeier
At a time when German Studies faces a serious challenge to its identity and
position in the European and international context, this new series aims to
reflect the increasing importance of both culture (in the widest sense) and
linguistics to the study of German in Britain and Ireland.
GLCS will publish monographs and collections of essays of a high scholarly standard
which deal with German in its socio-cultural context, in multilingual and multicultural
settings, in its European and international context and with its use in the media. The
series will also explore the impact on German society of particular ideas, movements
and economic trends and will discuss curriculum provision and development in uni-
versities in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Contributions in English
or German will be welcome.
