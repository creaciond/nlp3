Rhetorical analysis and the study of social reality 19
The analytical method
The analyses in this book are based on continuous communication between the
theoretical framework and the characteristic features of the text. Rather than
choosing in advance some specific features on which to focus, I read the texts
closely, looking for patterns in the grammar and style. In the process, my under-
standing both of the texts and of the Islamic field was changed considerably, so the
analytical process is very much a hermeneutic piece of work, its conclusions open
to reinterpretation and argument. This approach to the texts also led to variations
in the analyses according to which features proved to be especially interesting in
each writer’s work. Consequently, there is some variation in which specific gram-
matical and stylistic features are treated in each subsection of the analysis, but
they are all part of either the interpersonal or the ideational aspects of the texts, as
defined above.
Analytical tools
I have tried to make clear how I conceive of texts and their function in social rela-
tions. In this section, I will go into more detail about the analytical tools that I use
in the analysis. Terms and concepts from both Functional Grammar and the wider
area of text linguistics are central here, since, partly inspired by Halliday’s theory
and partly in parallel with it, text linguistics has developed to further elucidate
the connections between language use and meaning. In this regard, Ken Hyland’s
term metadiscourse is useful. It is a cover term for all the linguistic choices that
serve some purpose in the relation between writer and reader in texts (Hyland
2005). Hyland’s premise is that such linguistic choices interplay with the proposi-
tional content and aim of the texts in order to make the message more persuasive
– sometimes overtly and at other times more subtly.
Interpersonal aspects: personal reference
Given the interpretive approach, the concrete areas and tools of analysis were to
a large extent determined by the nature of the material at hand. However, the two
main pillars of the interpersonal analysis are personal reference – mainly pronoun
use – and mood choice. These two interpersonal aspects of the texts are a vital part
of all the three separate analyses.
Pronoun use is part of the metadiscourse in Hyland’s account, and it is a central
variable for analysing the ways in which the writers create roles for and rela-
tionships between themselves and the readers. Generic references such as ‘the
Muslim’ and ‘some people’ will also be considered in this analysis, since they
imply a ‘s/he’ and a ‘they’, respectively. The pioneering and classic statement
of the roles that pronouns play in social relations is Brown and Gilman’s famous
article about distance and solidarity in European languages (Brown and Gilman
1970). Even if their approach was to set up rather static ideal types of pronoun use
and its social implications, their idea of pronouns as a central way of signalling
20 Islamist rhetoric
power and solidarity has proved very fruitful. The present work is concerned with
pronouns as expressions of distance and nearness, solidarity and antagonism, and,
in correspondence with the interpretive approach, I consider pronouns in context,
rather than relying on quantitative data about the exact number of times certain
kinds of pronouns appear, for example.As Peter Mühlhäusler and Rom Harré state
in their acclaimed study of pronouns in social life:
We would like to argue that the meaning of we is dependent on the functional
context in which it is used and that consequently the primacy of its meaning
can only be determined in a functional model of language use.
(Mühlhäusler and Harré 1990: 172)
Notwithstanding this approach, however, some general assumptions about the
‘default’ implications of pronoun choice can be useful as a point of reference in
the analysis. Mühlhäusler and Harré quote one such principle which is particu-
larly interesting in the current context. It was developed by the linguist B.F. Head,
who collected data from 100 different languages. In the same vein as Brown and
Gilman, but with a much greater source of data as a basis for his claims, Head’s
principle concerns the parameters of distance and respect:
Respect and/or social distance are shown by choice either of plural form or
third person to address one individual. Variation of person, in languages in
which both person and number vary indicates greater respect. Respect is
mostly displayed to addressee rather than speaker or third person.
(Ibid.: 19)
Head’s principle is readily attested to in Egyptian dialect, where the use of second
person plural instead of singular is often used to seniors to signal deference and
hence social distance. In written Arabic, an impressionistic judgement is that, in
general, writers prefer to refer to their readers in the third person singular (more
correctly, they refer to ‘the reader’, but the underlying pronoun is mostly ‘he’ and
sometimes ‘she’), which ties in neatly with Head’s hypothesis about respect. In
my study, we may expect some variation in how readers are referred to, on account
of the default roles the three writers assume towards their readership: while
MuÎammad ÝImÁra is a public intellectual, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is a senior religious
leader and a preacher, and ÝAmr KhÁlid is one of the new, informal preachers.
They may thus be expected not only to employ pronouns referring to readers to
varying degrees, but also to refer to the readers differently. Consequently, Head’s
principle is used as a premise in the analysis.
Furthermore, we might ask to what degree each writer emphasizes his own
person in the texts by the use of pronouns such as ‘I’ and ‘we’. In his study of
the pragmatics of political discourse, John Wilson identifies the first person sin-
gular as the deictic centre of the discourse, in relation to which other entities are
positioned at varying points of distance and nearness by the pragmatic use of pro-
nouns (Wilson 1990: 58). To what extent do writers establish clear hierarchies of
Rhetorical analysis and the study of social reality 21
distance and nearness, and which evaluations accompany the different positions
on the proximity scales? These questions are very pertinent to my study and can
be answered only by close textual analyses where the situated use of pronouns is
looked at in detail, which is also what Wilson does in his analysis of spoken dis-
course by British politicians.
Another parameter that is central in the analysis is inclusion/exclusion, which
is expressed in a variety of ways. Wilson shows how the referents of ‘we’ vary
to a considerable degree even in the course of one speech or interview, and the
semantics of this pronoun is very elastic also in written discourse. It invariably
includes the writer, which is about as much as one can say about it with certainty.
Important questions in the analysis will be, for example: Who are included in the
‘we’ of the different authors – only the reader, a small community, or the whole
Islamic umma? What social and ideological significance do these choices have?
Furthermore, what is the relationship between this ‘we’and the other as expressed
by ‘they’or equivalents of this pronoun (for example, mentioning by name of col-
lective groups)? The answer to this question can tell us interesting things about the
ideology underlying each writer’s pragmatic choices.
Finally, pronouns are used to include the reader actively in the text. In this sense,
it is one of the means to make texts interactional, in Thompson and Thetela’s
(1995) phrase, i.e. to make the reader actively involved in the unfolding of the
argument (see also Hyland 2005: 49). There are other ways of doing this, too, as
we shall see presently in the treatment of mood, but the choice of how and when
to use pronouns can be one important way of activating the reader, and it has been
studied not least in academic texts (Harwood 2005; Hyland 2005: 151–152). The
extent to which different writers activate the readers can tell us something about
the relations that are created in the texts between writer and readers.
Interpersonal aspects: mood choice and stylistic features
The second main pillar on which the analysis of interpersonal aspects rests is the
system of mood. More specifically, I employ Halliday’s schema of speech func-
tions to study which speech functions are distributed in the texts and how they
are distributed. Halliday has systematized utterances into a schema consisting of
four primary speech functions, namely offer, command, statement and question.
All four call for specific kinds of reactions, so, in sum, these speech functions cast
writer and reader in different roles according to which choices are made in the
system of mood. I reproduce his model here in full (Figure 2.3) because an under-
standing of it is useful for several parts of the analysis. For the sake of simplicity,
I reproduce it in its English version. An Arabic one would diverge significantly in
its syntactic aspects, but the speech functions and the correlative participant roles
in this example are what matter here, and these are valid for Arabic also.
From the model in Figure 2.3, it is apparent that the writer can determine at will
which roles to give himself and his reader. For example, he can switch between
the roles of giving and demanding by switching between declaratives and impera-
tives, a rhetorical technique which is common in academic literature to involve the
22 Islamist rhetoric
reader (‘Consider the following example ...’). He can also pose pseudo-demands,
such as asking questions which he answers himself, but which involve the reader
by virtue of the form of the sentence, e.g. ‘What were the results of Nasser’s
nationalization programme in Egypt’s economic sphere?’ This is also a common
rhetorical tool. Such choices are a natural part of any text; they often contribute
to placing it in a certain genre, such as political speech or scientific textbook. In
argumentative, expository texts, for example, one expects the substantial parts
of the argument to be presented by declaratives, since they offer the possibility
of arguing over the propositional contents (Is he or is he not giving her the tea-
pot?). Hortatory discourse, on the other hand, is likely to feature much imperative
language, where the question is not to agree or disagree, but to obey or disobey.
Since there is not much literature about the generic features of different types of
religious texts in Arabic, the question of how the three writers I study here employ
specific patterns of speech functions is interesting in itself. However, the major
aim in studying their choices is to see whether these choices might have social
and ideological significance in context. In other words, I attempt to see whether
their ways of casting themselves and their readers in certain speech roles can say
something about the Islamic field and the writers’ position in it.
Modality is also part of the interpersonal analysis and applies to both commands
and statements. A writer can exhibit different degrees of commitment to the truth
value of a statement as well as to the imperative force of a command or wish. When
does he choose to express himself in absolute terms, when does he use hedges of
different kinds, and what can this tell us about the writer and the writer–reader
relationship? These questions will be addressed at various points in the analysis.

Rhetorical analysis and the study of social reality 23
In addition, choices about where to place important information in the clause
can have interesting rhetorical implications. This is because the system of mood
structures those parts of a clause about which it is immediately possible to argue.
Geoff Thompson (2004: 52) gives the following example. To the statement ‘She
was sacked last week by NatWest’, the answer ‘No, she wasn’t’ is possible, while
‘No, they didn’t’ does not work. This is because the validity of the statement
rests on the subject, ‘she’, and the process to which she is attached, ‘was sacked’.
Accordingly, the mood structure here allows for disputing whether it is she or he
who was sacked and whether it has happened or will happen: ‘No, it was Toby who
was sacked’, or ‘No, she has not been sacked yet.’ However, NatWest is not part
of the argument. Items other than the subject and the finite fall under the category
fittingly named ‘residue’ in Functional terms. Interesting possibilities arise here.
Consider the following sentence: ‘The ill-humoured, incompetent old hag was
sacked last week by NatWest.’ Here, several claims about the personality of the
woman are included in the clause, but they are not made open to argument, since
they are embedded as part of the subject. To dispute these claims, the hearer has to
change the topic of the whole exchange from the issue of a woman being sacked or
not to the question of her personal characteristics. For a writer, who is not exposed
to the immediate reaction of the reader, this feature of the language can be put
to rhetorical use, in the sense that s/he can place controversial claims in parts of
the sentence that are not immediately accessible for argument. This can be in the
residue, for example in an adverbial, or embedded in the subject. Thus, the mood
system can be a carrier for ideologically salient choices made by the writer.
In addition to the two main pillars of pronouns and mood, I will also briefly con-
sider the interpersonal implications of stylistic choices, such as rhythm, rhyme,
layout and graphics. This inclusion was determined by the source material, since
there turned out to be rather important differences between the texts with regard to
style. Stylistic features can thus indicate what aesthetic ideals or norms the texts
relate to, what they tell about the writer, and possibly also what they presuppose
about the reader.
As Hyland points out, all these interpersonal features can be subsumed under
one of the Aristotelian rhetorical categories of ethos, pathos or logos. I will make
such connections throughout the analysis, since differences and similarities in
what kind of persuasive tools each writer depends on provide one good way of
categorizing their texts and comparing them with each other and other agents in
the field of Islamic thought.
Ideational aspects: agents and processes
I stated earlier in this chapter that the ideational metafunction represents experi-
ence through the system of transitivity. Halliday writes that events in the world
can be categorized according to distinct process types:
[T]he clause is also a mode of reflection, of imposing order on the endless var-
iation and flow of events. The grammatical system by which this is achieved
24 Islamist rhetoric
is that of TRANSITIVITY ... The transitivity system construes the world of
experience into a manageable set of PROCESS TYPES. Each process type
provides its own model or schema for constructing a particular domain of
experience as a figure of a particular kind.
(Halliday 2004: 170)
Interesting questions arise here. How do acts of ‘imposing order’ on the flow of
events connect to social positions and religious ideology, for example? And what
might be the reasons for and implications of constructing ‘a particular domain
of experience as a figure of a particular kind’? These questions are central in the
analysis of the ideational aspects of the texts under consideration. Some more
detail is needed in order to make the framework applicable. At the very least, we
need to know how order is imposed and domains of experience are constructed.
According to Halliday, the grammar of any language automatically and implicitly
sets up different categories of processes to construe experience. These processes
are the central part of any utterance. Associated with each of them are different
kinds of participants who can be the subjects or objects of a particular process. At
a further remove are the circumstances which may or may not be included in the
utterance – the ‘where’ and ‘when’ of a particular process. Halliday has identified
three major kinds of processes in English, which are also applicable to Arabic. All
three will be mentioned at certain points in the analysis and should therefore be
introduced here.
Material processes comprise physical actions and happenings like walking,
opening, touching, falling, etc. Such processes have an Actor and (if they are tran-
sitive) a Goal. All material processes are about doing and happening, and thus
one potentially crucial question in terms of ideology is who or what is construed
as Actor in relation to any given process, and whether the process is construed as
an active or passive one. An imaginary example of news headlines all telling the
truth about the same event can illustrate the ideological potential of such selection
in a simple way:
Three persons die in downtown riots.
Three persons shot dead downtown during riots.
Police shoot and kill three persons during riots.
Riots downtown leave three persons dead.1
In all these sentences, the same material fact is presented in ways that place both
focus and responsibility on very different entities, ranging from the people who
died, via the police officers who shot them, to the event (the riots) itself.
In contrast to material processes that are about the material world, mental proc-
esses describe experiences of the internal world of the mind, such as thinking,
feeling, hearing, liking, etc. Consequently, the participants in such processes are
different from the ones in material processes. The most important characteristic
of mental processes is that there is always one participant who is human-like or
‘endowed with consciousness’ (Halliday 2004: 201). This participant is called the
Rhetorical analysis and the study of social reality 25
Senser, while that which is ‘sensed’ is called a Phenomenon. Consequently, when
entities that are not human are construed as Sensers, it implies some degree of
anthropomorphism that may or may not be of interest outside the purely literary-
technical domain. What are the possible meanings of construing entities such as
the state, Islam or the West as Sensers, for example?
Third, relational processes relate participants to each other, often by using the
copula: ‘I am a student’; ‘Getting a well-paid job was his main aim.’In Halliday’s
words:
In ‘relational’ clauses, there are two parts to the ‘being’: something is said to
‘be’ something else. (...) The configuration of Process + ‘Be-er1’ + ‘Be-er2’
opens up the potential for construing the abstract relationships of class-mem-
bership and identity in all domains of experience. Class-membership is con-
strued by attributive clauses and identity by identifying ones.
(Ibid.: 213–214)
In attributive clauses, the participants are the Carrier and the Attribute. Such proc-
esses ascribe some attribute to an entity. Identifying processes, on the other hand,
sets up a relationship of identity between two entities – one could represent it by
the = sign. The participants here are the Value, which is the more general category,
and the Token, which is the specific embodiment of that value. Thompson gives
the following example: ‘The church was his immediate objective’ (Thompson
2004: 96). Here, ‘the church’ is the Token, while ‘his immediate objective’ is the
Value that the church embodies. One grammatical test to decide which is which in
difficult cases is to turn the sentence into the passive and use the verb ‘represent’,
since this will work better with the Value than the Token. Consider, for example,
‘His immediate objective was represented by the church’ versus ‘The church was
represented by his immediate objective.’
I have explained this in detail because it has some importance for parts of the
analysis. As Thompson states:
A Value or Token analysis will often guide us towards the broader concerns
and values of the writer. Essentially, the Value reveals what values the writer
(and ultimately the culture that he or she is part of) uses to categorize the
Tokens that he or she deals with.
He adds that, in some cases, choices in this regard can ‘suggest wider ideological
beliefs which may be (...) open to question’. Accordingly, which attributes are
associated with people, groups or concepts, and how they are identified are poten-
tially of great interest in the areas of both reader–writer relations and ideology.
In addition to these three main categories of processes there are verbs of ‘say-
ing’ – verbal processes, which are a typical feature of news reports, for example,
and existential processes, which construe things simply as ‘being’: ‘There was a
cat outside the door.’These will be mentioned only in passing below, and so I will
not use space on them here.
26 Islamist rhetoric
Sometimes, the distribution of processes in a text is necessarily closely bound
up with its nature; instruction manuals, for example, are likely to consist of mainly
material processes. With both literary and expository prose, however, the distribu-
tion of process types can be much more varied. The choices an author makes in
this regard thus contribute to constructing a particular view of the world and the
things that go on there. I will use the transitivity system to throw light on how
Islam, Muslims and other concepts that are connected to them in the three dis-
courses are construed by means of metadiscourse.As is probably clear by now, the
central question in this regard is if a specific construal of reality appears to have
ideological significance. As Norman Fairclough states: ‘When one wishes to rep-
resent textually some real or imaginary action, event, state of affairs or relation-
ship, there is often a choice between different grammatical process and participant
types, and the selection that is made can be ideologically significant’ (Fairclough
2001: 100).
A second important question is: Who are the Actors associated with the differ-
ent process types – people, institutions, groups or other entities? Are these Actors
portrayed as active or passive, and what relationships do they enter into? The
ideological importance of all these questions is not only that they can tell us some-
thing about the general world-view and preoccupations that a writer exhibits in a
text. Just as important is the fact that the choices a writer makes with respect to
processes and participants can determine how an argument might be presented and
what Actors can be associated with it. Thus, the transitivity structures of an argu-
ment are effectively part of the argument itself, but they are so only implicitly, and
therefore function in subtle ways. The reader will have to concentrate on what is

not being said to detect them, and sometimes it turns out that these implicit argu-
ments can be just as interesting as the explicit ones.
In conclusion, the analytical method can be summarized in a table, as I have
done in Figure 2.4. The word ‘context’ refers to the immediate context of a lin-
guistic feature, such as the chapter or argument in which it occurs, as well as the
extra-literary social, religious and political context of contemporary Egypt. When
the different questions are fleshed out in the analysis and at points intertwine, this
chart is a useful reference that helps keep in mind the major areas dealt with and
the roughly defined divisions between them. The analysis will draw on all the
variables contained in Figure 2.4, but, owing to the sometimes big differences
between the discourses of the three writers considered, not all the variables are
given equal weight in the individual analyses.
Some problematic analytical issues
It would have been comfortable if all the choices I had made during the work with
this book were natural and obvious beyond discussion, but this is of course not
the case. Considering my interpretive approach and the criticism that has been
directed at similar kinds of studies (e.g. Widdowson 2004), as well as my choice
of only written books as the source material for the analysis, some explanations
and clarifications are in order.
Discourse analytical studies that are based to a large extent on the analyst’s
interpretation of a limited range of texts have come under attack for lacking both
objectivity and consistency. I will not enter into details about the theoretical dif-
ferences underlying this criticism and the debates it has provoked (see Widdowson
2004; Wodak 2006), but instead comment on the more practical and methodologi-
cal criticism. A key criticism against discourse analysts has been the relative lack
of use of corpora (e.g. Stubbs 2002: 209–210). This criticism is not hard to under-
stand, since discourse analysis based on a corpus is no doubt more reliable than
analysis based on the subjective selection of texts. The reason that I have neverthe-
less opted for the latter is that I am not interested in the connection between lan-
guage use and macro-trends in society, which is the subject of most politically and
sociologically oriented discourse analysis, and in which case corpora could indeed
improve the analyses. I am rather interested in the individual persuasive tools of
three undisputedly prominent individuals in Arab Islamic culture, and the inter-
play between the content of their message, its form and their role in the Islamic
field. In such a study, both the immediate and the wider contexts of each separate
grammatical instance are very important to the interpretation of its significance,
and a corpus-based analysis is not ideal for that kind of work. I am interested not
in generalizations but in significant occurrences of grammatical phenomena, and
this means that my approach is qualitative rather than quantitative.
A related problem that is also about qualitative and quantitative considerations
is the fact that I have studied relatively few written works from each author’s oeu-
vre – this is especially true for YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and MuÎammad ÝImÁra. How
can we know that the books I have selected are representative of their rhetoric and
28 Islamist rhetoric
style? The immediate answer is, of course, that we cannot. There is indeed a fair
chance that some of the works by any of the three are marked by a distinctly dif-
ferent style, according to their subject matter and likely audience. However, I have
chosen books that I think are the most interesting and important ones for this kind
of socio-religious study for the following two reasons. First, they are concerned
with issues that are central to religious debates and concerns among the Egyptian
public: public and private morals, Islamic history, relations with the West and
Islamic revival generally. Second, this means that the books about these issues are
aimed at a general, although interested, audience. This is borne out by the fact that
several of the books under discussion here often occupy prominent and visible
positions in the bookshops in central Cairo and the religious bookshops in middle-
class and upper-class areas like al-MuhandisÐn and al-DuqqÐ. Of course, this does
not mean that they are widely read. In his study of the literary field in Egypt, Yves
Gonzalez-Quijano presents some appallingly low figures for the reading popula-
tion, and, although this work is from 1993 and figures about reading habits are
very uncertain, it is safe to assume that well under 5 per cent of the population
read books at all (Gonzalez-Quijano 1993). George N. Atiyeh further notes that
‘[m]ost works are printed in editions of less than five thousand copies, for an Arab
population of 180 million’(Atiyeh 1995: 250). Still, there is no doubt that the three
writers in this study are well known among broad segments of the population, and
that their discourse matters in religious, cultural and political matters.
The low number of readers in Egypt raises a further question: Why have I cho-
sen written material, when the three figures in question are all well-known televi-
sion personalities and, in the case of ÝAmr KhÁlid and YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, even
famous as such? The primary reason is that I find print culture in Arabic countries
interesting, so I wanted to investigate that rather than other kinds of media. A pos-
sible objection to this choice is that their televised discourse has more impact than
their written one, and that there might be contradictions between them.An impres-
sionistic judgement is that no contradiction exists. The TV appearances of YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ, ÝAmr KhÁlid and MuÎammad ÝImÁra seem to corroborate the results
of the analysis of their written texts, although they of course rely on more and
other techniques in their live appearances, such as voice pitch, gesturing, code-
switching and so on. There is no doubt that their spoken discourse reaches many
more people than their written one. But nevertheless, as Atiyeh (1995) also notes,
books remain central to the cultural imagination, not least in the religious field, as
shown by Gonzalez-Quijano (1993: 413–423). In any case, a text linguistic study
of spoken Islamist discourse would be welcome. Such a study would, hopefully,
add to rather than contradict the analysis in the present book.
Even within the restricted area of analysing written discourse I have had to omit
some important and highly interesting aspects. These have to do with punctuation
and the graphic aspects of the source texts. The fact that punctuation is less than
standardized in Modern Standard Arabic, to say the least, gives room for a high
degree of idiosyncrasy in contemporary Arabic literature. This point is relevant
especially in the texts of MuÎammad ÝImÁra, who uses quotation, question and
exclamation marks often and, it would seem, in ways that add important layers
Rhetorical analysis and the study of social reality 29
of meaning to his texts. To a lesser degree, the same could be said of YÙsuf al-
QaraÃÁwÐ. As for graphic aspects, including paragraph organization and layout,
the texts of all three authors display interesting properties. I have chosen to omit
these aspects, which I had originally intended to include, for two reasons. First,
they would have increased the scope and length of this book considerably, and I
was, quite simply, out of time before I had the opportunity to integrate them to the
necessary extent. The second point is related to the first. There is not a whole lot
of literature about modern Arabic stylistics, and the rather chaotic area of punctua-
tion in particular has received curiously little attention. It seems to me that the field
needs a general study on these issues before jumping straight into a discussion of
specific punctuation and layout choices in three very different case studies.
3 Islamic ideology and the
public sphere in Egypt
Public arguments about Islam in Egypt today are shaped by two fundamen-
tal structural elements. First, the competition for symbolic power between the
Islamist movement and the state has defined Islamic orthodoxy in the public
sphere. Second, there is a sharp ideological divide between Islamists and liberal
intellectuals. The texts that are the object of study here are all written against this
background. It is therefore necessary to state clearly the meaning and contempo-
rary function of the competition for symbolic power, orthodoxy, and the ideologi-
cal divide between Islamists and liberalists.
The different actors in the religious field share the contested legacy of
MuÎammad ÝAbduh (1849–1905), the great religious reformist who was among
the first to grapple seriously with the questions of Islamic tradition and modern
thought. ÝAbduh’s point of departure was the decay of the Arab-Islamic world and
the triumph of Western imperialism in the region, and he sought to renew Islamic
thought and practice so that the Muslim world would once again flourish, based
on an indigenous system of thought. Like Jamal al-Din al-AfghÁnÐ, he held the
view that Islam was
the middle path between two extremes: a religion fully consistent with the
claims of the human intellect and the discoveries of modern science, but safe-
guarding the divine transcendence which, for him as for al-Afghani, was the
one valid object of human worship and stable basis for human morality.
(Hourani 1983: 144)
ÝAbduh thought that when the Islamic law is fully understood and obeyed society
flourishes, and that when it is misunderstood or rejected society decays. The rea-
son that Islamic society fell into decay is twofold, according to ÝAbduh: alien ele-
ments (extreme ShiÝism and the philosophers) came into Islam and, second, later
generations lost sight of what was essential in Islam and what was not, so they
started elevating small matters into principles of faith and laid the foundations for
taqld, the unquestioning adoption of orthodox beliefs and ideas. His view here
has been a major inspiration for today’s Islamists.
As Malcolm Kerr showed in his celebrated study of Islamic reform, neither
ÝAbduh nor his student RashÐd RiÃÁ were able to solve the tensions between
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 31
traditional Islamic precepts and European modernity, and their programme of
reformist revival became instead ‘an uneasy process of ideological assimilation’
(Kerr 1966: 210). The result was (and is) that:
No one in Egypt, for example, is heard today mourning the legacy of
MuÎammad ÝAbduh: on the contrary, everyone claims it as his own. (…) Such
diverse individuals as the liberal constitutionalist AÎmad LuÔfÐ as-Sayyid,
the militant fundamentalist Íasan al-BannÁ’ of the Muslim Brethren, and
GamÁl ÝAbd an-NÁÒir can all be identified, each in a different way, as heirs
of ÝAbduh.
(Ibid.: 15)
In other words, ÝAbduh created a discursive universe from which later secular-
ists and traditionalists alike could get legitimacy for their ways of appropriating
Islam to modernity, or the other way around. Thus, the battle over his intellectual
heritage rages in books and media outlets in the Arab world even today. Since the
1960s, the dominant trend has been the Islamist one.
Islamism was based from the outset on two immediate problems: the perceived
distortion and marginalization of Islam in public life, and the cultural and mili-
tary imperialism of the West, in all its physical, economic and intellectual aspects
(Mitchell 1993: 209–295). Islamic history is seen by Islamists as a long period
of slow, but steady, decline ever since the fourth Muslim caliph died in the late
seventh century AD. According to Islamist ideology, a corrupt political culture and
theological factionalism resulted in the stagnation of Muslim civilization and ever
more pressure from the more dynamic regions outside the Muslim world, specifi-
cally Europe. The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that the conflict with the impe-
rialist West was a conflict not between religions, but between civilizations, and
that the twin factors of societal degeneration and imperialism threatened the very
existence of Islamic civilization. The westernization of Egypt corrupted society
and resulted in cultural schizophrenia and a torn nation.
This two-pronged challenge to Muslim societies is overcome by reinstating the
Islamic order (al-niz
.m al-islm) as intended by God and his prophet Muhammad.
Islamist activists have employed two strategies to achieve this aim: calling people
to an Islamic awakening through social activism and calling for the implementation
of shar‘a, divine law, in society. It is important to implement the shar‘a not only
because a proper practice of Islam rests on it, but also because of a strong ‘social
sense of disorder and disequilibrium and historical dislocation’ (ibid.: 246).
If we take the founding of the Society of Muslim Brothers in Egypt in 1928 as
the starting point of Islamism, it quickly evolved into a highly organized polit-
ico-religious force in opposition to both the religious experts (the ulama) and the
state. The ulama were largely conservative and out of touch with developments in
society, and the religious institution al-Azhar at times openly worked against the
Muslim Brotherhood (Lia 1998: 224–227). The state at this time was associated
with British imperialism, which the Brotherhood was of course fiercely opposed
to. With the Free Officers’ revolution from 1952 onwards these constellations
32 Islamist rhetoric
changed. Nasser nationalized al-Azhar in 1961, thus in the long term opening the
political and social fields to the hitherto marginalized religious professionals. As
for the state and organized Islamism, successive regimes have adopted varying
strategies, tightening and loosening the reins at irregular intervals, especially dur-
ing the presidencies of Sadat and Mubarak.
Today, the Muslim Brotherhood is allowed to be active to a certain degree,
but crackdowns and mass arrests are still the order of the day. On the other hand,
apolitical movements and preachers who largely sympathize with the aims of the
Muslim Brotherhood are allowed to operate more freely: this is the case with the
slick new preachers as well as organized apolitical movements such as al-JamÝiyya
al-sharÝiyya, which had 123 branches in Cairo alone in 1999 (Sullivan and Abed-
Kotob 1999: 33–34). In fact, most religious activism concerned with the religious
and cultural fields is tolerated by the state, since it does not challenge the state
politically. As a result of this policy, a religious discourse of both personal and
public piety is conspicuously present in the Egyptian public sphere, floating above
a simmering political tension between the Islamist opposition and the repressive
state apparatus.
Carrie Rosefsky Wickham (2002) has argued that one of the results of this situ-
ation is an Islamic ‘parallel sector’ that comprises social, political and economic
activities and that provides the citizens with services which the corrupt state cor-
poratism was meant to offer but cannot. This development came as a result of
Islamic student mobilization in the 1970s, which was encouraged, ironically, by
the late President Anwar Sadat’s effort to eradicate Marxism and Nasserism from
university campuses across Egypt. The activities of the Islamic student movement
were centred round three axes: private mosques, Islamic voluntary associations
(e.g. health clinics and schools) and Islamic for-profit commercial and business
enterprises (e.g. banks and publishing houses) (ibid.: 97). In addition, Islamists
took control of some of the most important professional associations, such as the
medical association and the lawyers’ syndicate. Slowly, a big, decentralized and
informal network of Islamists was built up, with connections on several levels of
the administration and the official religious establishment. Wickham mentions as
an example of the latter that several al-Azhar shaykhs were employed as advisers
to Islamic banking projects (ibid.: 110).
In the parallel Islamic sector, the mosques and economic activities have con-
solidated a consciously Islamic culture that has in turn influenced the cultural
and religious fields in Egypt. These trends have also found their way to the upper
echelons of society, where since the mid-1990s the upper middle and upper classes
have arranged religious salon meetings and engaged in ‘Islamic’ economic activ-
ity. This phenomenon is closely bound up with the appearance of the ‘new reli-
gious preachers’, to which group ÝAmr KhÁlid belongs. Another consequence of
the mass mobilization was the appearance of a new generation of Islamists, the
centrists, which will also be extensively studied below.
Together with the development of the Islamist parallel sector the oil boom in
the Gulf countries has influenced religious thought and culture in Egypt. A large
number of Egyptians worked as engineers, doctors, teachers and so on in these
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 33
countries during the 1970s and 1980s, and earned smaller or greater fortunes during
this time. Many of these were, or became, Islamists. They brought with them back
to Egypt not only money which they invested in independent mosques, Islamic
welfare projects and savings schemes, but also a conservative outlook coloured by
the culture in these countries. In this way, they contributed substantially both to
the economic side of the parallel Islamic sector mentioned above and the spread
of a conservative Islamist culture in Egypt (DiyÁb 2002: 46–50). In addition, the
Gulf countries themselves, and especially Saudi Arabia, started supporting the
production and publishing of conservative religious books and magazines. As a
result, a number of classical exegetical works as well as numerous books and pam-
phlets describing an ‘Islamic’ way of life became easily available and extremely
cheap. In this way, writes Aziz Al-Azmeh, Petro-Islam has ‘broken the secularist
and nationalist cultural, mediatic and, to a lesser extent, the educational monopoly
of the modern Arab state’(Al-Azmeh 1996: 73). It is a proof of Petro-Islam’s suc-
cess when Wickham in 2002 notes that ‘it is both my own assessment and that of
other informed observers that regardless of its source, the printed media [in Egypt]
tended to promote a socially conservative version of Islam, in part as an outcome
of Saudi influence’ (Wickham 2002: 135).
This situation has consequences for religious culture in Egypt. In a recent book,
the Iranian sociologist Asef Bayat (2007) has described the Egyptian political
situation with the expression ‘fragmentation of Islamism’: He says that ‘[T]he
Islamist movement experienced a process of simultaneous decline and fragmen-
tation, as conservative religiosity, individualized piety, and the “seculareligious
state” converged.’The result has been an ‘Islamism without an Islamic state and a
remarkable stagnation in religious and intellectual thought’ (p. 138).
A defining feature of the current religio-political climate is the competition for
symbolic legitimacy between the Islamists and the state. The state has managed
to retain its hold on power by giving more room for religious activism in those
areas of society that are not directly linked to power politics, namely the religious
and cultural fields. Islamist activists have eagerly seized on the opportunity thus
given, and have confronted the state by referring to the court system all sorts of
cultural products which they deem to be un-Islamic. This can be seen as a way of
compensating for the fact that they do not directly control the levers of political
power. Since Islamism is in many ways an identity project, the Islamist discourse
on cultural and religious issues is bound to be conservative – in often sharp dis-
tinction to its discourse on politics, which is relatively progressive. The state and
the Islamists are engaged in a competition to appear most Islamic – which in the
religious and cultural field means most conservative.
But the regime and organized Islamism are not the only players in the field.
Since Gamal Abdel Nasser’s time the Egyptian state has tried to co-opt the reli-
gious establishment.The reason is simple: when the regime’s positions and policies
are backed by leading ulama who can support their views by citing authoritative
religious sources, it is more difficult for the religious opposition to contest these
policies on religious grounds. Thus, it is well known that al-Azhar is divided along
political lines and has been for many years: some ulama align themselves with the
34 Islamist rhetoric
regime, others with the Islamists. However, in questions of religious and cultural
orthodoxy, most of them follow the rule of nearly all religious establishments
everywhere: they are conservative by default.Accordingly, they tend to agree with
the Islamist opposition in questions of religious doctrine and on cultural issues,
notwithstanding the political support by some of them of the regime. This leads to
ever greater pressure on the regime to show its devotion to true Islam as it is seen
by the Islamists and the ulama in questions cultural and religious.
Consequently, liberal Islamic thinkers, secularists, artists and authors are caught
between a rock and a hard place: while they are attacked for their ‘heretical’views
by the religious establishment and the oppositional Islamists alike, they receive
little or no support from a government which does not want to arouse religious
anger and at any rate has no need for critical religious thought that is closely con-
nected to the social and political realities in Egypt.
As a consequence of this situation, orthodoxy in the religious and cultural fields
is defined in distinction to liberal thought.1
This has had tangible cultural and
physical results. During the last twenty years, four incidents have taken place
which vividly illustrate this. Since they also provide a very relevant context for
the texts under consideration in this study, I will use some space to comment on
them here. First, the outspoken secular intellectual Faraj FÙÃa was shot and killed
by Islamist extremists in 1992. The assassination followed closely on the famous
debate at the Cairo book fair where Faraj FÙÃa vehemently attacked Islamist ideas
about state and society, accusing Islamism of being a totalitarian ideology. His
opponents were the respected shaykh MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ and MuÎammad
ÝImÁra (MuÎsin 1992). Two years later, the Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz was
stabbed in the neck because an Islamist extremist deemed his works immoral. In
1995, the intellectual NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd was forcibly divorced from his wife
in an Egyptian court, on the grounds that his writings about the QurÞÁn and Islam
proved that he was an apostate. Following death threats against him, he fled Egypt
and settled in the Netherlands, where he still lives, with his wife. In July 2005, an
intellectual compatriot of AbÙ Zayd, Sayyid MaÎmÙd al-QimanÐ, who has written
extensively on pre-Islamic times and early Islam, as well as critical articles about
Islamism, publicly declared that he disavowed all his writings and would refrain
from publishing anything in the future. The reason was that he had received death
threats against himself and his family.2
It was of course not Islamist intellectuals or shaykhs from al-Azhar who stood
behind any of the crimes mentioned above. FÙÃa and Mahfouz were attacked by
extremists, and the same is probably the case with al-QimanÐ. Most likely none of
the activists had read the works of the people they attacked. And this is where the
Islamist intellectuals and shaykhs from al-Azhar enter the picture – or, more accu-
rately, this is where the force of their words becomes relevant. In the FÙÃa case, the
prominent shaykh MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ stated shortly before the assassination
that it was a duty for any Muslim to punish an apostate if the state apparatus did not
do it (Najjar 1996: 4–6). The extremist who stabbed Naguib Mahfouz was probably
influenced by the strong condemnation of the book Awld H
. ratin (published in
English as Children of Gebelawi) by Muslim shaykhs and the leadership of the
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 35
Muslim Brotherhood. They suggested that Naguib Mahfouz might be an unbeliever
after he published the book, which is an allegory over the historical material in the
three monotheistic religions and includes critical characterizations of God and the
prophets. (The book is still banned in Egypt, although it is easily available, and the
Brotherhood did not officially reconcile with Naguib Mahfouz before he lay on his
deathbed in 2006.) In the uproar that followed from the AbÙ Zayd case, the well-
known columnist and independent Islamist FahmÐ HuwaydÐ wrote that AbÙ Zayd’s
way of approaching the QurÞÁn amounted to an attack on the Constitution and pub-
lic order in an Islamic country like Egypt. Thus, he implicitly suggested that AbÙ
Zayd’s works be regarded as high treason against the state (Wielandt 1996: 265).
The professor at DÁr al-ÝUlÙm and regular preacher at the famous ÝAmr ibn al-ÝÀÒ
mosque, ÝAbd al-ÑabÙr ShÁhÐn, has described AbÙ Zayd’s works as ‘reprehensi-
ble’, ‘cultural AIDS’ and a ‘Marxian-secularist attempt to destroy Egypt’s Muslim
society’ (Najjar 2000: 179). While such examples are proofs of leading Islamists’
attempts at making liberal propositions anathema, they also serve as cues for less
moderate people. Among the Islamist constituencies, supporters have proven they
will gladly join protest marches against books they have never before heard about,
as long as a spiritual authority says that it is anti-Islamic. As for the more extrem-
ist organizations, they have shown that they are capable of drawing their own and
more drastic conclusions from the statements of religious leaders.
Since the 1990s, the tendency towards a conservative hegemony over cultural
life has only continued. A peak was reached in 2000, when the state-sponsored
literary series fq al-Kitba (Literary Horizons) published the Syrian writer
Íaydar Íaydar’s novel Walma li-a‘shb al-bah
.r [Banquet for seaweed] (Íaydar
2000). Conservative critics reacted to some minor details in the book (a couple
of sexual depictions and a derisive exclamation about the QurÞÁn and religious
authority by one of the protagonists), and a major cultural battle ensued, complete
with demonstrations, petitions and death threats. In the end, the whole series was
suspended. Even a relatively liberal Muslim Brother like ÝAbd al-MunÝim AbÙ
al-FutÙÎ still condemns this book as blasphemous,3
showing that he is not willing
or able to see the difference between an author’s personal views and the views of
his fictitious protagonists (the book tells the story about Iraqi communists who are
stranded in 1980s Algeria, where Islamism is on the rise).
Together with the silencing of the scholar and secular critic Sayyid MaÎmÙd
al-QimanÐ in 2005, this episode goes to show that a conservative discourse has
all but fastened its hold on Egyptian cultural and religious debate and mindset. In
an eloquent commentary on the Íaydar affair, the renowned literary critic Sabry
Hafez depicts a country where the symbolic dominance of modernism that was
nurtured under MuÎammad ÝAlÐ and blossomed in the interwar years has been
defeated. The precondition for the killing of Faraj FÙÃa, the lawsuit against AbÙ
Zayd and the uproar over Íaydar’s novel was that
[T]raditionalists had now turned the tables on their opponents. Instead of peri-
odic reinterpretation or appropriation of the story of the Prophet by rationalists
and modernists – now suppressed by a rigidly orthodox canon – treatises were
36 Islamist rhetoric
appearing on topics once the bastion of modernity, calling for the develop-
ment of a specifically Islamic literature. Although it is difficult to take many
of these tracts seriously as intellectual arguments, culturally they represent a
complete reversal of the rise of modernism to symbolic domination in the first
half of the twentieth century.
(Hafez 2000: 124–125)
With these words, Hafez neatly captures both the main ideological conflict in the
cultural field and the way in which it is bound up with the field of power, or the
political field. However, as has already been hinted at, there are different actors
with different identities and interests among the orthodox groups. A more detailed
presentation of the three groups we focus on here is therefore in order.
Three major groups within Egyptian Islamism
Despite the abundance of academic work on Islam and Islamism in Egypt, it is still
difficult to comprehend fully the network of relations, sympathies and antipathies
that pervade the Islamic field. One reason is that, to my knowledge, there have
not been any comprehensive attempts to investigate Islam in Egypt in terms of a
structured field. Most studies on Islam in Egypt that deal with relations between
different agents tend to focus on the ideology and social position of a specific
institution, such as al-Azhar or the Muslim Brotherhood, or they concentrate on
the antagonism between secularism and Islamism. Furthermore, there is a ten-
dency among many scholars of Islamism to focus on power politics and issues
like human rights, regime stability and democracy. Important as these questions
are, they are not the only ways to understand Islam as a social and political force
in Egyptian society. In fact, the focus on political and cultural dichotomies of the
state versus an Islamist opposition and the secular elite versus conservative Islam
might rather obscure the picture of the field, since there are more than two posi-
tions along both the state/opposition and secularism/Islamism clines.
In this book, I focus on three major groups of agents in the Islamic field. These
are the religious establishment, the new Islamic preachers and the wasat
.iyya intel-
lectuals. This selection by no means covers the entire field of Islamic cultural
production, but it does include the agents that have provoked the most interest and
turmoil in the field for some time. In addition these groups are important to cur-
rent debates about culture, religion, identity and politics in the wider Arab world
and Europe.
The religious establishment
One of the three central groups of agents in the Islamic field is the ulama. These
religious jurists and theologians are guardians of a centuries-old religious herit-
age and remain faithful to conservative Islamic views of the QurÞÁn and sunna,
drawing on classical works in their argumentation about current religious, cul-
tural and social issues. They should not be confused with the official religious
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 37
institution, which comprises al-Azhar, DÁr al-iftÁÞ and the Ministry of Religious
Endowments, though this institution, and the various bodies of al-Azhar in par-
ticular, is of course populated mainly by ulama.4
The reason I want to separate the
religious establishment and the religious institution is that the former is in some
ways independent of concrete institutions and that some of the most important
ulama frequently take positions which are at variance with those taken by the
leaders of the religious institution. Instead of defining the religious establishment
in terms of location, I will use some central characteristics that separate them from
other agents in the Islamic field.
I define the religious establishment as a group of agents who have received an
Islamic education at one or other of the major and time-honoured Islamic seats of
learning and who work with Islamic thought and practice. They are thus experts in
one or more of the traditional Islamic sciences: jurisprudence, the sources of law,
dialectic theology and so on. They are intimately familiar with the Islamic reli-
gious heritage and Islamic history, and they acceptAshÝarÐ dogma, by and large, as
the orthodox statement of Islamic doctrine. In short, they are the men (since they
are almost without exception male) who are authorized to wear the cap and robe of
the religious scholar, bearing in this respect a great resemblance to Christian cler-
ics. Accordingly, in Bourdieu’s sense of the words, they can be viewed as priests
serving and protecting the authority of the church: a category of agents who jeal-
ously guard their ‘monopoly of the legitimate exercise of the power to modify, in
a deep and lasting fashion, the practice and world-view of lay people’ (Bourdieu
1987: 126).
Notwithstanding this definition by Bourdieu, there has been a tendency in
modern scholarship to dismiss the ulama as irrelevant on account of their pre-
occupation with other-worldly concerns and obsolete theological issues. Recent
developments prove such claims wrong, however, since a number of ulama have
managed to engage with current concerns and play important roles both in Egypt
and internationally, not least thanks to the power of television. As Muhammad
Qasim Zaman argues, the ulama
are hardly frozen in the mold of the Islamic religious tradition, but this tradi-
tion nevertheless remains their fundamental frame of reference, the basis of
their identity and authority. (...) Their larger claim on our attention lies in the
ways in which they have mobilized this tradition to define issues of religious
identity and authority in the public sphere and to articulate changing roles for
themselves in contemporary Muslim politics.
(Zaman 2002: 10)
There are of course social and ideological differences and conflicts within the
establishment; one could, for example, divide the ulama into apolitical and politi-
cal groups, and the latter is quite obviously further divided into those who propa-
gate a peaceful political Islamism and those who support or even head militant
movements. However, these are not distinctions that will be pursued here. I am
interested in two general characteristics shared by most sections (and certainly the
38 Islamist rhetoric
most influential ones) of the religious establishment in Egypt and arguably in the
contemporary Arab Islamic world in general. These characteristics are: 1) a pre-
dilection towards a conservative approach to the religious texts and the tenets of
classical Islamic thought; and 2) a pronounced preoccupation with asserting their
authority in the religious field and their relevance in society. The two points inter-
twine to a large degree, which will be reflected in the discussion below and in the
analysis of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts. They are interesting characteristics for our
purposes because the former connects with the question of ideological struggle in
the Islamic field, whereas the latter connects with the current socio-religious real-
ity in contemporary Islam, which is said to be characterized by a fragmentation
of religious authority. Before we start analysing YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts on the
background of these characteristics, a survey of current research that relates to the
ideological and socio-religious aspects of the ulama in Egypt is useful.
Let us start with the predilection towards an orthodox approach to Islamic texts
and thought. As Muhammad Qasim Zaman argues, the ulama have shown them-
selves open to including other groups in discussion about the central concept of
unanimity (ijm‘), but they do not accept criticism of the results of classical ijm‘,
for example the doctrine on the necessity of the caliphate (Zaman 2006). This is
a symptom that, while they are willing and often quite able to engage with diffi-
cult contemporary questions in society, most of them remain nevertheless locked
in a discursive universe which restricts the scope for renewing thought. This is
attested to by the fact that, if one reads Kate Zebiri’s book (Zebiri 1993) about the
great reformist shaykh of al-Azhar, MaÎmÙd ShaltÙt (d. 1963), the likeness of his
ideas to those of a contemporary shaykh like YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is striking, and
the faithfulness both of them display towards classical Islamic ulama is equally
noticeable.
Salwa Ismail argues that the ulama are part of what she calls ‘conservative
Islamism’ (Ismail 1998), a term that covers the fields of social norms, politics and
economic behaviour. She defines it as a non-violent movement that works both
within and outside state structures. Conservative Islamists are so called because
they show a ‘willingness to work within the established order and because they
promote hierarchical and patriarchal values reinforcing the status quo’ (Ismail
2003: 28). This definition fits the majority of important Egyptian ulama well,
since many of them work within the state institutions, such as those of the opposi-
tional al-Azhar group Jabhat ulama al-Azhar (Zeghal 1999: 389–391), and some
outside, such as YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ. Malika Zeghal argues convincingly that a
long-term result of Nasser’s nationalization of al-Azhar in 1961 has been that the
ulama have emerged as mediators between the government and militant Islamists,
gaining in the process considerable leverage over state policies, especially in the
cultural and social domains (Zeghal 1999). The ideological implications of this
situation are obvious and were touched on above. For example, the Ulama’s Front
played an important part in the witch-hunt that forced NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd and
his wife to emigrate from Egypt to the Netherlands in the mid-1990s (ibid.: 391).
The ulama have contributed to a state of affairs that is succinctly summarized by
Sami Zubaida: ‘Conservative Islam in present-day Egypt spans government and
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 39
opposition, official institutions and political parties, and is emboldened to embark
upon extensive censorship of cultural products and attempts to moralize public life
and space’ (Zubaida 2003: 160).
The ulama partake actively in the suppression of liberal culture. They do so
from their own specific vantage point, as religious professionals with an intimate
knowledge of a tradition and texts that also constitute an important part of their
claim to authority. Their response when dealing with ideologically contentious
issues in contemporary Islamic thought is likely to be coloured by this fact, and an
interesting question in this regard is if and how this is reflected textually: are there
specific characteristics of their rhetoric that can be connected to their close rela-
tionship with the Islamic tradition and the historical role of the ulama in creating
and preserving Islamic orthodoxy? We will try to answer this question by looking
at the way in which YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ constructs Islam and Muslims textually, as
well as by studying his style of writing as a rhetorical device.
The question of ideology is difficult to separate from the issue of authority and
the ulama’s position in the Islamic field, but I think a distinction should still be
made between them, since the ulama compete with and to some extent seem to
clash with other agents that share the ideology of Islamism with them. Conflict
between agents in the Islamic field runs along more than one, ideological line.
The issue at stake here would seem to be the question about who is to fill what
function within Islamism. Although the cultural and social situation in Egypt sug-
gests that there is collusion between different forces in the religious field – ulama,
agents within the system of justice, lay activists and intellectual Islamists – current
research seems largely to agree that relations are not as harmonious as might be
thought, stressing instead the competition between different groups. The tension
between the religious professionals and lay Islamists has been noted for a long
time (e.g. by Eccel 1984: 520). Today, the situation seems even more complex,
largely as a result of new technologies of mass communication. Dale Eickelman
and James Piscatori’s work in this regard, with their hypothesis about fragmenta-
tion of religious authority, has become a standard reference in the field: ‘[t]he
‘ulama no longer have, if they ever did, a monopoly on sacred authority. Rather,
Sufi shaykhs, engineers, professors of education, medical doctors, army and mili-
tia leaders, and others compete to speak for Islam’(Eickelman and Piscatori 1996:
131).
Nevertheless, as both Malika Zeghal and Muhammad Qasim Zaman show, the
ulama have been able to secure a prominent role for themselves in contemporary
Islam, both in Egypt and internationally. As Zaman writes, this has to do with the
fact that they speak to many of the same audiences as the Islamists, at the same
time as they are not as exposed to governmental suppression as Islamist move-
ments (Zaman 2002: 173). Zaman at the same time warns against drawing too
thick a line between ulama and activists, and Zeghal notes that the fragmentation
of authority is ‘linked with conflict and violence in the political arena’ (1999:
372). Authority in contemporary Islam thus seems to be a rather complex issue,
and the current situation in Egypt supports both the claim about fragmentation and
the increased prominence of the ulama. Whereas both Zeghal and Zaman have
40 Islamist rhetoric
demonstrated that the ulama’s standing has improved in many respects, the ulama
are nevertheless sometimes deemed to be irrelevant or even to lack religious cred-
ibility. There are several reasons for this: some ulama support the corrupt regime
in Egypt, satellite television has brought more and less qualified Islamic preachers
into the living rooms and spiritual lives of millions of Egyptians, and many ulama
are perceived to speak in a way and about issues that alienate ordinary people.
Within this picture, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ has been extremely successful in navi-
gating the field, acquiring for himself a position as perhaps the most prominent
‘lim worldwide in Sunni Islam. How does he tackle rhetorically the problem of
fragmentation of authority from his position as a guardian of religious tradition,
and how does he relate to other agents? These are questions that have not been
answered clearly, and certainly not from a rhetorical perspective. The analysis
of his texts in the next chapter is intended to provide material for an answer to
what role both ideology and authority play in his metadiscourse, and how they are
intertwined.
The new Islamic preachers
In one sense, the very appearance of ÝAmr KhÁlid as a preacher superstar is a
symptom of the fragmented situation described above, and he is indeed considered
by some observers to be ‘potentially subversive’, in both the religious and the
political field (Wise 2004). ÝAmr KhÁlid is arguably the most influential exponent
of the ‘phenomenon of the new preachers’, as Rz al-Ysuf journalist WÁÞil LuÔfÐ
calls it (LuÔfÐ 2005). This phenomenon has quickly become an important part of
Egyptian society since its beginnings in the first part of the 1990s. What are its
characteristics, and where is it situated in the Islamic field in Egypt?
First we need to clarify what this phenomenon is about. The short answer is that,
during the 1990s, a new kind of preacher rose to prominence in Egypt, one that is
not connected to al-Azhar or the Muslim Brotherhood, and whose representatives
dress in suits and ties rather than robes. In most cases, they have had little religious
education (ÝAmr KhÁlid is an accountant, for example), and they focus on issues
other than fiqh and hadith in their preaching. What they do is to awaken people
spiritually by preaching a simple religious message that is intimately connected
to modern life. A positive attitude, openness to the world, social conservatism,
economic liberalism, management thinking and a spirit of enterprise are the main
constituents of their discourse, which is mediatized through the Internet, TV and
audio-cassettes or CDs; it is no coincidence that they rose to fame at the same time
as the availability and popularity of satellite television skyrocketed in the Arab
world.
The new preachers can be situated in wider sociological, religious and politi-
cal frames, both local and international ones. Starting with the local, WÁÞil LuÔfÐ
argues that the development of the new preaching correlates with several other
trends in Egyptian society: Islamic salons, where upper-middle-class and upper-
class women (and increasingly also men) meet in each other’s houses to listen
to a private sermon or lecture, after which food or snacks are served; the close
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 41
ties that have evolved between religion and business; the rising importance of
so-called ‘Islamic medicine’ and ‘Islamization of science’, i.e. alternative medi-
cine and explanations of natural phenomena based on the QurÞÁn and sunna; and
the new Islamic bands, which have pious lyrics about God and Islam instead of
worldly love. All these developments support each other. WÁÞil LuÔfÐ views the
new preachers as expressions of a ‘post-organizational Islam’that takes over from
ossified organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood and militant groups that have
lost the popular influence they once had. According to him, the new preaching is
characterized by a superficiality which is the hallmark of contemporary Egyptian
youth culture. One of its main traits is the refusal to break with the order of the
day, whether on the political, social or religious level. The new preachers do not
involve themselves in politics, they do not criticize the religious establishment
and they do not preach against dominant social norms (LuÔfÐ 2005: 163). The only
innovative credit he is willing to grant them is when he describes ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
discourse as including the newest political developments on a global scale, cou-
pled with economic and cultural liberalism.
LuÔfÐ’s analysis is not without problems. First, his denunciation of an empty
message for rich Egyptians is inaccurate, at least today and in the case of
ÝAmr KhÁlid. Even though ÝAmr KhÁlid started out as a preacher in the private
sporting club NÁdÐ al-Òayd in al-MuhandisÐn, Cairo, his fame and charisma have
long since spilled over the walls of this exclusive club. At present, many of his
most avid fans are middle- and lower-middle-class people from areas like ImbÁba
and BÙlÁq al-dakrÙr, which makes it difficult to dismiss the new preaching as a
religious pastime for rich people. During my own fieldwork I visited the offices
of the publishing house that publishes both books and audio material for ÝAmr
KhÁlid, and there was nothing luxurious about it. Both the office and the employ-
ees appeared middle-class rather than upper-class. Second, LuÔfÐ portrays ÝAmr
KhÁlid as a preacher for youth, but this is not accurate. Many of his fans are
middle-aged and even elderly people, so his popularity is not confined to young
Egyptians. The fact is that ÝAmr KhÁlid manages to relate successfully to wildly
different strata of society, and this is neglected in WÁÞil LuÔfÐ’s analysis. Third,
positing the new preachers as representatives of a post-organizational Islam
that picks up the pieces after the failed Muslim Brotherhood is positively wrong.
In 2006, the Muslim Brotherhood performed exceedingly well in the general
elections, and other analyses of the organization do not give the impression of
stagnation, but rather a well-oiled organization (Shehata and Stacher 2006).
Instead, one can talk about a metamorphosis of the Muslim Brotherhood, as
does Mona El-Ghobashy (2005), or transformations in the organization, as does
ÍusÁm TammÁm (2006). Setting the new preachers and the Muslim Brotherhood
up against each other thus seems to contradict facts. A more interesting path of
inquiry would be to investigate if and how the new preachers as a new force in
the Islamic field influence other Islamic cultures, including those associated with
the Muslim Brotherhood. As for the new preachers’ use of satellite TV and the
Internet, other agents in the religious field have done the same for a long time, so
this is hardly a new phenomenon. People as far removed from each other in the
42 Islamist rhetoric
field as YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and militant jihds have used the Internet and satel-
lite channels for a long time. Despite its detailed and valuable insights, LuÔfÐ’s
analysis thus leaves some substantial questions about the nature and meaning of
this phenomenon to be answered.
In a broader study, Swiss sociologist Patrick Haenni treats the new preachers as
part of a globalized culture which he calls ‘Market Islam’ (Haenni 2005). Market
Islam is characterized by enmity towards big institutions and big state and a pref-
erence for individual enterprise and initiative. In Haenni’s analysis, the opposition
to the Muslim Brotherhood is framed in more concrete terms than in WÁÞil LuÔfÐ’s
study. He describes ÝAmr KhÁlid as being on ‘the other side of the world’ (aux
antipodes) in relation to Islamism, focusing as it does on state and politics, where
Market Islam forefronts enterprise and market (ibid.: 90). Furthermore, Market
Islam does not approve of the rigid bureaucracies of the Muslim Brotherhood, for
example:
L’entrepreneur de l’islam de marché perçoit l’islamisme comme le vecteur
de toutes les grandeurs rejetées par le nouvel esprit du capitalisme, notam-
ment l’inadaptabilité, l’autoritarisme, la rigidité, l’intolérance. Au contraire,
on retrouve, à tous les niveaux de l’islam de marché, les trois grands motifs
de la littérature managériale des années 1990: l’anti-autoritarisme, l’éloge de
la souplesse et de la réactivité, et la réalisation individuelle.
(Ibid.: 91)
Haenni’s term ‘Islam through projects’ (l’islam par projets) as a part of Market
Islam is an apt one, considering the importance ÝAmr KhÁlid places on entrepre-
neurship and private initiative. Haenni draws a parallel to George Bush’s faith-
based initiative in the USA and the American ‘compassionate conservatism’. Like
compassionate conservatism, Market Islam is anti-state, socially conservative and
economically liberal. With the new preachers in Egypt, this ideology enters into a
Kulturkampf against the fatalism and localism of traditional Islam, in opposition
to which it proposes a new, market-friendly religiosity which is bourgeois, cos-
mopolitan and proactive. Richness is praised and encouraged, but within proper
bounds of modesty and piety. There is, however, no talk of social justice (Haenni
2005: 59–64). The rich take back religion from the poor and dispossessed and see
nothing wrong in being prosperous, since they can use their wealth for the good of
God and the umma. For Haenni, this amounts to a new Islamic reformism:
[S]ur fond de théologie de prospérité musulmane et de différenciation bour-
geoise, un nouveau réformisme se construit qui abandonne les institutions
pour les mentalités et substitue à la lutte politique une guerre culturelle fondée
sur les valeurs de la culture d’entreprise.
(Haenni 2005: 67)
ÝAmr KhÁlid’s preaching can certainly be seen as reformist. His aim is to put Islam
into the service of development, hence his initiatives ÑunnÁÝ al-ÎayÁ (Lifemakers)
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 43
and Right Start, where he and his followers cooperate with researchers, adminis-
trative organs and organizations to fight unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, drug
abuse, smoking and so on. Behind all this is his ambition to fight resignation, ‘car
c’est bien ce qu’il appelle la “négativité”, et non l’impérialisme culturel occiden-
tal ou le complot sioniste, qui, selon lui, est au cœur de la décadence du monde
arabe’(Haenni 2005: 70). According to Haenni, what we have here is a practically
oriented reformism opposed to traditional Islam and with a heavy emphasis on the
individual. In this way, the phenomenon of the new preachers is a new group of
agents in the Islamic field that also brings with it a new ideology.
But what about the doctrinal aspects of the new preaching and its approach to
Islamic tradition and the holy texts? They are also, unquestionably, ideologically
salient. Do they point towards a new reformism?At least when it comes to content,
the answer is no. Doctrine is an area the new preachers stay away from, given their
often weak scholarly credentials. They are quite happy to accept orthodox dogmas
and, as both WÁÞil LuÔfÐ and Patrick Haenni point out, they generally shun political
issues. Sociologist Asef Bayat captures the picture nicely when he comments that
[ÝAmr KhÁlid’s] doctrinal views hardly differ from those of orthodoxAzharite
sheikhs who dismiss him, despite and perhaps because of his immense pop-
ularity. Rather, in the current juncture in Egypt where religious thought in
general possesses little sign of innovation (and this is testified by Islamic
thinkers from Youssef El-Qaradawi to Selim al-Awa, to activist Essam El-
Erian), Khaled appears an innovator, even though only in style.
(Bayat 2003)
However, both this quote and Patrick Haenni’s analysis raise some important ques-
tions that are left unanswered. A central issue is that Haenni, like LuÔfÐ, seems to
presuppose a conflict between a ‘mainstream Islamism’represented by the Muslim
Brotherhood and the new Market Islam. But, as I noted above, there is nothing in
recent events in Egypt to suggest that the interplay in the Islamic field between
different Islamist agents is characterized by zero sum games at present. And
although there is no doubt that the market- and emotion-oriented religious culture
represented by the new preachers is something new in the Islamic field, Haenni
seems to overstate some contradictions between Islamism and the new preachers.
First, it is not entirely clear what and whom he means by Islamism in the quote
above. One of the presuppositions in this study is that Islamism appears in dif-
ferent manifestations that may contradict each other on some levels, but remain
homogeneous on a fundamental epistemological level. Second, if Islamism is
taken to mean organized activity along the lines of the Muslim Brotherhood,
recent research has shown that this organization cannot without problems be
characterized by rigidity and bureaucracy. Utvik (2006) shows how the
Brotherhood’s economic discourse is a modernizing one in the Egyptian
context, while Shehata and Stacher (2006) describe a well-functioning politi-
cal organization. Nevertheless, it is clear that the new preachers and more
traditional Islamists of the Brotherhood type are two very different entities within
44 Islamist rhetoric
Islamism. How, then, to explain in more nuanced terms the relation between the
new religious preachers and agents like the Muslim Brotherhood or the religious
establishment? Current analyses focus mostly on content and mediation. I think
one interesting and hitherto unexplored portal to this problematic can be language
use.
The second point I would like to raise connects to Bayat’s dismissive comment
that ÝAmr KhÁlid ‘appears an innovator, even though only in style’. I agree that
ÝAmr KhÁlid’s style is innovative, as will be shown in Chapter 6, but I think Bayat
underrates this factor in his judgement. If style is the only novelty about ÝAmr
KhÁlid, and if it is not of any consequence, as Bayat seems to imply, why have
the Egyptian authorities consistently made life difficult for ÝAmr KhÁlid in Egypt,
why are the ulama often severely critical of him, and why have liberal intellectu-
als taken great interest in him? When these facts are seen together with KhÁlid’s
unorthodox style, I would suggest that his style, or rather the combination of style
and content, might carry meaning by itself, and should thus be given due atten-
tion. However, there has been little focus on KhÁlid’s style, and none at all on
his rhetoric. The little research there is concentrates, quite naturally, it should be
added, on his TV appearances. The most serious treatment of the subject is given
in an M.Phil. thesis by Lindsay Wise (2003), who analyses his TV shows from the
point of view of media studies. Focusing on both the discourse and the appearance
of his TV shows, she speculates that there might be subversive power in the way
ÝAmr KhÁlid straddles boundaries: he makes a clean break with the traditional
Islamic shaykh in both appearance and language, and yet he is a preacher. By his
popularity he challenges the authority of traditional religious authorities, includ-
ing the state-sponsored ones, but he does so in a subtle and elusive way (Wise
2003: 89–91).
On the background of this survey, there are two central questions to be addressed
in the analysis in the following chapters: In what way does ÝAmr KhÁlid represent
something rhetorically new in the field?And what are the implications of his unor-
thodox style with respect to both ideology and the positions occupied by himself
and other Islamists in the field?
The wasat
.iyya intellectuals
Though not affiliated with any specific institution the centrists (wasat
.iyyn) are
nevertheless a distinct group in the Islamic field. The people in this group repre-
sent a variety of professions from journalism to theology, but they have in com-
mon that they are all notable intellectuals in Egyptian public debate. Their main
project is to renew Islamic thought so as to appropriate it to the modern world,
while remaining true to what they regard as Islamic authenticity. Their aim in
doing this is to prevent Egypt and Islamic societies generally from becoming sec-
ularized, since they deem secularization to be incompatible with Islam. It should
be stated at once that al-Azhar-educated shaykhs such as YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ
and the late MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ are also commonly described as centrists.
I agree with this conclusion, but it is based on ideological factors alone, and in
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 45
the present book the two groups of religious professionals and lay intellectuals
are kept apart, since one aim is to explore their different roles and rhetoric and
connect these to their positions in the Islamic field. Considering the role of the
wasat
.iyya intellectuals, a characteristic feature of the dynamic of the field for
the last thirty years or so is that, among the Islamists, they have been the most
actively engaged in dialogue and (perhaps more often) polemic with liberal and
secular intellectuals. Their writings thus have important ideological effects in
the field, and this fact will be reflected in the analysis of MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s
texts.
Who are they, and what common characteristics do they possess? Different
scholars make different categorizations. I will discuss four central and recent con-
tributions in order to set the stage for the analysis and identify issues that remain
unresolved. There are two book-length studies about this trend, one in English
and one in Arabic. Raymond William Baker (2003) identifies as centrists KamÁl
AbÙ al-Majd, TÁriq al-BishrÐ, FahmÐ HuwaydÐ and SalÐm ÝAwwÁ in addition to the
shaykhs MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ and YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ. For some reason he does
not include MuÎammad ÝImÁra in the list.According to Baker, these thinkers strive
to modernize Islamic thought in a number of areas, and use independent judge-
ment (ijtihd) to arrive at a form of Islam that is relevant for contemporary socie-
ties. In addition, they have engaged in dialogue with their intellectual opponents
and members of other faiths. Baker states that these are bold initiatives in a society
which has been characterized by religious and political polarization since the early
1980s. The general impression he gives is that the independent Islamists represent
the single most promising, moderate and authentic Islamic voice in Egypt today
(Baker 2003: 274–276). It is true that the independent Islamists support peaceful
dialogue and oppose violence, and given the climate in which Baker’s academic
project takes place it is easy to sympathize with his approach to the centrists (see
Baker 1997). However, his almost panegyric account suffers from some serious
shortcomings. First, the mere existence of other, more radically reformist think-
ers who also insist that they are sincere believers, like NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd
and JamÁl al-BannÁ, suggests that Baker does not provide the full picture against
which to measure the independent Islamists. Second, he does not try to situate
them in a wider context in any systematic way, but is content to note that they
are opposed to both secularism and conservative Islam. Third, he does not give
attention to either their discourse on the ‘other’ (the West and secularists), which
is found abundantly in their writings, or their views on different approaches to the
QurÞÁn and sunna, which have been contentious issues in the Egyptian religious
public sphere for decades.
A more critical approach, and a very stimulating one, is taken by MuÎammad
ÍÁfiÛ DiyÁb (2002), whose studies regrettably have had little impact in European
and American scholarship, probably because he writes in Arabic. DiyÁb investi-
gates closely the discourse of ÓÁriq al-BishrÐ, KamÁlAbu al-Majd, FahmÐ HuwaydÐ
and MuÎammad SalÐm ÝAwwÁ, whom he names ‘the independent Islamists’. He
does not include YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ or MuÎammad al-GhazÁli, possibly because
of theirAzharite educational background and their long-standing relationship with
46 Islamist rhetoric
the Muslim Brotherhood. He has also omitted MuÎammad ÝImÁra, for reasons I
will discuss below.
In his sociological and discourse-oriented study MuÎammad ÍÁfiÛ DiyÁb
acknowledges the differences between the individual writers in the group.
Nevertheless, he is able to point at some shared, fundamental positions and ambi-
guities that distinguish them from other currents in Egyptian religious thought.
According to him, there are five points that justify calling these four ‘independent
Islamists’ (DiyÁb 2002: 26–32):
1 On the structural level, they are independent from the religious establishment,
which DiyÁb defines as al-Azhar, DÁr al-iftÁÞ, MajmaÝ al-buÎÙth al-islÁmi-
yya, al-Majlis al-aÝlÁ li-l-shuÞÙn al-islÁmiyya, WizÁrat al-awqÁf and al-Majlis
al-aÝlÁ li-l-Ôuruq al-ÒÙfiyya, in addition to numerous media and educational
institutions.
2 As for their method, they place themselves between scripturalism and exten-
sive personal interpretation, exemplified by the al-Azhar mainstream and
NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd, respectively.
3 On the level of thought, they regard impulses from outside as necessary for
a bright future, and devote much time to issues of freedom, critical studies
on the past and women’s rights. However, they distance themselves from
both ‘traditionalists’ and ‘renewers’. Among the latter are the Islamic leftist
Íasan ÍanafÐ, NaÒr AbÙ Zayd and former high judge MuÎammad SaÝÐd al-
ÝAshmÁwÐ. DiyÁb does not mention any traditionalists by name, but defines
them as people who do not consider modern views on humanity, freedom and
society, but use all their energy to focus on personal obligations in Islam, like
prayer and rules for executing all sorts of everyday tasks.5
4 On the ‘anthropological’level, they are between the people who call for as
.la
and the ones who are preoccupied with staying in tune with the times.
5 On the political level, they regard themselves as standing above political fac-
tions, although DiyÁb points out that this is not really the case, since they have
sympathies towards moderate Islamism.
DiyÁb concludes by stating that they are independent inasmuch as they consist-
ently opt for a golden mean, both between liberals and conservatives and between
the state and radical Islamism. In trying to develop a specifically ‘Islamic’
alternative in the quest for civilizational development, they are an extension of
reformist thought (DiyÁb presumably thinks of MuÎammad ÝAbduh and RashÐd
RiÃÁ here).
Nevertheless, he is very critical of their attitudes to issues like gender and reli-
gious freedom, although there are variations between them on these accounts. As
with Baker’s claims for the wasat
.iyyn, MuÎammad ÍÁfiÛ shows that the inde-
pendent Islamists are willing to tackle, and are capable of tackling, pressing issues
in Egyptian society, such as democracy, women, and economic distribution with
reference to Islamic texts. However, in his view, they fail to renew Islamic thought
in any substantial way:
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 47
We venture the claim that the discourse [of the independent Islamists] has not
succeeded in founding new questions about the subject of Islamic culture (...).
It seems to be confined within the limits of ‘salafist renewal’ when it tries to
reconcile the changing reality with the unchanging text and, in the implicit
urge to return [to a previous point in history], expressed in the statement that
the future does not acquire meaning except to the extent that it conforms to
the past ...
(DiyÁb 2002: 181)
DiyÁb here puts his finger on a central aspect of the independent Islamists’thought,
namely their ahistorical treatment of history and al-turth, which significantly
compromises their attempts at a critical reinterpretation of religious thought, and
which, moreover, connects them to the wider mainstream of Islamism. This does
not, however, mean that the independent Islamists are not different from other
Islamist currents, as represented for example by the more conservative parts of the
Muslim Brotherhood. One indicator of their different position in the field is their
active support for the Wasat
. party effort, which included both Copts and Muslims
and championed full participation of women in all arenas in society. The inde-
pendent Islamists also, ostensibly, exhibit a greater degree of pluralism than some
other Islamist forces in Egypt. For example, several of them roundly criticized the
lawsuit against NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd that was raised in 1993 because of his writ-
ings on the QurÞÁn and sunna. Even though they all reacted strongly to his proposi-
tions, they stated that this was an intellectual and theological issue that does not
belong in a courtroom. As for their relation to the religious institution, some of
them are not in favour with either al-Azhar or the government. FahmÐ HuwaydÐ
has published a book with essays that were censored by the Egyptian authorities
(HuwaydÐ 2004), and SalÐm ÝAwwÁ has published a whole book devoted to the
‘crisis of the religious establishment’ (ÝAwwÁ 1998). As for ÓÁriq al-BishrÐ, al-
Azhar censors tried to stop the publishing of a book about Muslims, Copts and
national unity in Egypt (DiyÁb 2002: 168). Their appeal is also rather narrow.
They are not media stars, and do not captivate people in the way that TV preachers
such as the late MuÎammad MutawallÐ al-ShaÝrÁwÐ or ÝAmr KhÁlid do. Instead,
they cater mostly to the religious intelligentsia.Although this is a small segment of
the Egyptian public, the independent Islamists’ involvement with the Wasat
. party
shows that they nevertheless influence wider circles than their own.

48 Islamist rhetoric
As for the exclusion of MuÎammad ÝImÁra from the study, MuÎammad ÍÁfiÛ
DiyÁb cites as reasons his changes of position over the years and the fact that the
independent Islamists keep their distance from him.6
In the face of current reali-
ties in the field, however, these objections do not in my view stand up to scrutiny.
The intellectual position of MuÎammad ÝImÁra has remained virtually unchanged
for the last twenty years, which should suffice to put him in a category. As for the
claim that other centrists keep their distance from him, I have not been able to
ascertain whether this is correct. However that may be, MuÎammad ÝImÁra is still
a member of a select group who regularly contribute articles to the Islamist intel-
lectual journal al-Manr al-jadd, and who include as writers several of the inde-
pendent Islamists (Hamzawy 2000). Furthermore, his position on violence and
exegesis is centrist through and through (e.g. ÝImÁra 1998a).And lastly, like all the
other figures I have mentioned, MuÎammad ÝImÁra grapples with intellectually
sophisticated questions about theological epistemology, methods of exegesis and
relations between politics, society and religion. Consequently, I think it is analyti-
cally safe to include him as a central figure among the wasat
.iyya intellectuals.
How do we sum up what centrism is about? Based on DiyÁb’s account and some
recent articles that treat centrism (Stacher 2002; Polka 2003; Utvik 2005), the fol-
lowing characteristics seem fitting:
• It rejects blind imitation (taqld) of both classical religious authorities and
Western thought, at the same time as it defends the time-honoured principles
of fiqh.
• It acknowledges the need for new Islamic solutions and ideas in modern soci-
eties, and thus opens the way for a comprehensive rereading of the QurÞÁn and
hadith.
• It supports modern political institutions such as democracy and rejects total-
izing forms of religion.
• It stresses the need for respect towards other directions of thought and dia-
logue instead of confrontation.
One example of how these attitudes can work in practice is given by Bjørn Olav
Utvik, who has studied the abortive attempt at forming the Islamic Wasat
. party – a
party that included a Copt in its founding committee and is committed to plural-
ism and a strong civil society – in Egypt in 1996 (the party is still struggling to
obtain its licence). Utvik argues convincingly that this attempt worked together
with other factors to make the Muslim Brotherhood more tolerant. Sagi Polka, in a
study about centrism and Egypt’s cultural identity, concludes that, ‘read in a social
and cultural context, the Centrists’attempt to arbitrate an ideological compromise
between moderate secularity and moderate Islam, the true Islam in their eyes, is
extraordinary’ (2003: 60).
There are two problems here, however. First, non-Arab scholarship on centrism
considers only the purely political import of the movement, thus downplaying
the cultural component inherent in its ideology. It is probably right that cen-
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 49
trism represents something qualitatively new in Islamic political thought, and
Shahrough Akhavi has shown how the two centrists FahmÐ HuwaydÐ and ÓÁriq
al-BishrÐ depart from AshÝarism’s view that humans do not have free will and
instead opt for theories that have more in common with modern social contract
theorists such as Locke (Akhavi 2003). But, considered from a cultural and theo-
logical point of view, they invariably stick to essentialism and orthodoxy and offer
little that is new. This cultural dimension of their discourse should be given more
attention, since the cultural field has become an increasingly important ideological
battleground not only in Egypt but also in other Arab and European countries.
DiyÁb has done this. He has also treated four of the centrists individually and
compared their positions on a range of specific issues. Here we come to the sec-
ond point, which is that, unlike DiyÁb’s analysis, most treatments of centrism are
content with sweeping generalizations. Even though Polka admits that centrism
comprises an ‘enormously diversified population’ (2003: 59), the movement in
both his own and others’ treatment is represented as a more or less homogeneous
religious tendency in Egypt. However, this does not help in explaining why the
name of FahmÐ HuwaydÐ is a red rag for many liberal Egyptian intellectuals, or
why MuÎammad ÝImÁra is widely regarded by Copts as inciting public opinion
against them, at the same time as these figures embrace the values of dialogue and
respect. Other centrists are not as controversial. If such differences mean some-
thing, and there is good reason to believe they do, analyses of centrism should try
to nuance the picture of this movement. One important question in this respect is
in what ways the individual centrists are different from each other, and what these
differences mean, seen in the light of the current intellectual climate in Egypt,
the Arab world, and even beyond, to the European sphere. DiyÁb has made an
important contribution by looking at the content of the centrists’ discourse; I will
supplement his analysis by investigating their ways of persuading.
The ‘other’: the new Islamic intellectuals
The new Islamic intellectuals constitute one of the principal ‘others’ for the
Islamists. They and their positions are inextricably bound up with the dynamic
of the Islamic field, and they are therefore presented briefly here, even though
their texts are not part of the object of our inquiry, except as for purposes of
comparison.
First, some terminological tidying up has to be done. The most common labels
for this group in the Islamic field are ‘secularists’and/or ‘liberals’. Both terms are
frequently used but poorly defined by actors and observers alike. I will briefly
review the problems before explaining my own choice of terminology. Starting
with common usage, it is normal for Islamists to denounce their intellectual critics
as ‘secularists’ (‘almniyyn), and this term has become accepted as a label for
all those who challenge orthodoxy, for example by denying that Islam should be
a central part of the political framework of the state or by adopting a historical-
critical approach to the QurÞÁn, sunna and established religious tradition, which
enjoys a quasi-sacred status. On the other hand, the term ‘liberal’ is often used
50 Islamist rhetoric
in much the same sense, as for example in the term ‘the new Arab liberals’, a
group of intellectuals who are adamantly secular and strongly opposed to both
the current regimes and the Islamist opposition in the Arab world (Høigilt 2005).
Yet there are differences between those who engage actively with Islamic con-
cepts and religious thought and try to carve out alternative religious ideologies,
such as NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd and MuÎammad SaÝÐd al-ÝAshmÁwÐ, and thinkers
who objectify Islam to a greater degree and comment on it from an outside per-
spective, such as the Moroccan Abdallah Laroui. To confuse matters even more,
several of those who are denounced in Egyptian debates as secularists would not
fit into that category in some of the academic research on the Islamic field in the
Arab world. In his comprehensive survey Ghassan Finianos (2006) distinguishes
between apologists who try to ‘save’ Islam from the Islamists, and freethinkers
(libres penseurs) who are dedicated to a secular outlook and are ‘partisans de la
culture ouverte’ (ibid.: 151). The problem here is that those Finianos identifies as
apologists are as much dedicated to an open culture as the freethinkers. Moreover,
the terrain does not really fit his map. During the great debate between secular-
ists and Islamists at the Cairo book fair in 1992, MuÎammad AÎmad KhalafallÁh,
who is described by Finianos as an apologist, seconded Faraj FÙda, a freethinker
if there ever was one, on the secular side. Finianos’s divisions are thus in danger
of being somewhat artificial.
A more fruitful approach is taken by Alain Roussillon (2005), who identifies a
global group of ‘new Islamic intellectuals’. Common for them is that they all take
on a struggle to redefine Islam as against both Islamists and the religious estab-
lishment, and that their approaches, notwithstanding often great differences, are
all marked by a certain degree of sophistication, sometimes a very high degree.
Roussillon’s definition includes such diverse intellectual figures as MaÎmÙd
MuÎammad Óaha, Abdallah Charfi, Íasan ÍanafÐ, Abdolkarim Soroush and NaÒr
ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd, to mention some important names. According to Roussillon,
these thinkers represent
une pensée qui se présente comme en rupture avec les différentes «orthodox-
ies» en présence – celles des États, des oulémas, des islamistes, mais aussi
celles d’outsiders plus ou moins autorisés à se prononcer sur «l’Islam» –, et
entend pourtant continuer d’opérer à l’intérieur d’une tradition musulmane
qu’ils se donnent précisément pour objectif de réinterpréter.
(Ibid.: 20)
Perhaps stretching Roussillon’s definition a bit, polemicists like MuÎammad SaÝÐd
al-ÝAshmÁwÐ and Sayyid al-QimanÐ can be included alongside theorists such as
NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd and Íasan ÍanafÐ. We then have a definition that covers
the group with which the centrist intellectuals especially often clash.
What are the basic propositions of the new Islamic intellectuals in Egypt, then?
In this book, I will use two of them – NaÒr ÍÁmidAbÙ Zayd and Sayyid al-QimanÐ
– as models. The reason for choosing them is that both have been active in the
Egyptian public sphere during the 1990s and early 2000s and, though they share
Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt 51
some common ideas, their writings are clearly distinct from each other in both
form and content. To start with what they share, it is a historical-critical approach
to Islamic dogma. Being a historian by profession, Sayyid al-QimanÐ caused uproar
with his investigations into the origins and early history of the Islamic community,
as well as with his etymological explorations of religious concepts (e.g. al-QimanÐ
1996). NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd has been heavily criticized and condemned as an
apostate for his linguistically informed approach to the QurÞÁn. According to him,
the QurÞÁn became a cultural product the moment it appeared as text in the world,
and as such must be contextualized (AbÙ Zayd 2000). His theory includes severe
attacks on icons of orthodox Islam such as al-GhazÁlÐ (d. 1111) and the religious
establishment after him, whom he accuses of making the QurÞÁn into an object of
worship instead of interpretation, thus depriving Muslims of the means to liber-
ate themselves from oppressive and religiously based ideologies. Both of them
have combined their theoretical work with scathing criticism of contemporary
Islamism and the religious establishment, al-QimanÐ even more than AbÙ Zayd
(e.g. al-QimanÐ 1999, 2006;AbÙ Zayd 2003). The latter especially has emphasized
his commitment to the Islamic faith all along, in the face of those who claim him
to be an unbeliever.
What function do they have in the Islamic field? As Roussillon states, their
space of manoeuvring is very limited, and they are not able to intervene force-
fully in their own societies, since they are not willing to provide a set of norms of
behaviour and thought, as their opponents among the Islamists and the religious
establishment are. On the other hand, their importance should not be underesti-
mated, because they are the best bet for avoiding the self-fulfilling prophecy of a
clash of civilizations by virtue of their open-minded and inquisitive attitudes to
both their own and other traditions of thought (Roussillon 2005: 178–181). To this
we might add that the new Islamic intellectuals are also the ones in the Islamic
field who actually practise the right to disagree and freedom of expression to the
greatest degree, and these are values that are also explicitly embraced by centrism.
Against this background, the role of the new Islamic intellectuals in the rhetoric
of both the wasat
.iyya intellectuals and the religious establishment is worth explor-
ing. In addition to this exploration, towards the end of the analysis I will briefly
consider the rhetoric of NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd and Sayyid al-QimanÐ in order to
see how it corresponds to the rhetoric of their opponents, and how it contributes to
shaping relations between agents in the Islamic field.
The survey of four central groups of agents in the Islamic field in this chapter has
revealed several areas where a linguistic analysis of their rhetoric might yield
interesting results. The religious establishment is eager not only to retain, but to
enhance, its role as the ultimate religious authority in Islam, at the same time as it is
committed to a traditional corpus of religious texts and knowledge. Consequently,
there is a possible edge in its discourse against both the new Islamic intellectuals,
who propose new ways of approaching the holy texts, and the new preachers, who
intrude on the ulama’s territory, though usually not challenging their authority. In
what ways is their socio-religious role expressed in their rhetoric?
52 Islamist rhetoric
As for the new Islamic preachers, the central question is whether their status as
a new force in the Islamic field is reflected in their rhetorical strategies. First, we
will examine the socio-religious aspect of their appearance by asking if their rhet-
oric contributes to ‘displacing the structure of temporally hierarchized positions
opposed within the field’ (Bourdieu 1993: 60). The second question is whether
their rhetoric can throw more light on their ideological importance than has been
done by previous research.
One of the most important functions of the centrist intellectuals in the reli-
gious field has been to engage with secular and liberal trends within Egyptian
and Arab thought. Consequently, the question of ideology would appear to be the
most important one in relation to their rhetoric. However, we will also make brief
comparisons between MuÎammad ÝImÁra and other centrists in order to illuminate
centrism’s nature as an intellectual movement.
Lastly, all the questions here that are connected to ideology need to be measured
against the ideas and rhetoric of the new Islamic intellectuals in order to be under-
stood in their proper context, and so this group will also play a role in the analysis
of Islamist discourse in the next four chapters.
4 The rhetoric of religious
authority
Before we can embark on a meaningful analysis of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s (b. 1926)
language, we need to put his discourse in context. Who is he, and what are the central
features of his thought? By the European media, he is often described in terms such
as ‘firebrand cleric’ (Ungoed-Thomas and Berry 2004) or, in less hostile presenta-
tions, as a scholar with a ‘streetwise touch’ (Bowcott and al Yafai 2004). Neither
characterization hits the mark. Although YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ sometimes lends reli-
gious backing to the use of violence, he is mainstream more than firebrand, and
although popular among Muslims all over the world he has certainly not got a ‘street-
wise touch’. On the contrary, he is very dignified and anxious to uphold traditional
Islamic etiquette, in both his dress and his way of talking about religious issues.
Strangely, considering YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s long-standing and international
fame, little serious research has been done about his intellectual positions and
production, so I will present them in some detail.1
The best way to characterize YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is to describe him as a centrist
religious scholar whose thought and socio-religious identity are determined by
his education from al-Azhar and his long-standing affiliation with the Muslim
Brotherhood. By virtue of the former capacity, he has a leading position in several
international boards of Islamic scholars. As for his affiliation with the Muslim
Brotherhood, he became a member of Íasan al-BannÁ’s organization in 1942–43,
and he served some time in prison and concentration camps for it. He has even
been asked to head the Muslim Brothers, but refused, since he wants to be an
independent preacher for the whole Islamic umma, according to himself.2
As a
result of these two affiliations, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s thought and discourse are
heavily influenced by both traditional Islamic literature and modern Islamism.
The reliance on modern Islamism is shown by his many references to Íasan al-
BannÁ. Although he cites Sayyid QuÔb approvingly in his works, he was never
a radical, and followed the accommodationist line of supreme guides Íasan al-
HuÃaybÐ and ÝUmar al-TilmisÁnÐ during the 1960s and 1970s. At the same time,
some of his most important sources of learning and inspiration are famous ulama
like the grand shaykh of al-Azhar MaÎmÙd ShaltÙt (d. 1963) and the Muslim
Brotherhood-affiliated MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ (d. 1996). From his youth, he stud-
ied and was influenced by the great scholars of Islam AbÙ ÍÁmid al-GhazÁlÐ (d.
1111) and Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) (Wenzel-Teuber 2005: 37).
54 Islamist rhetoric
This mix of influences has contributed to making him perhaps the most famous
exponent in the Arab world today of the ideology of wasat
.iyya, or centrism. This
concept is found everywhere in his books, and the Israeli scholar Sagi Polka even
identifies him as the originator of the term (2003: 40).3
As I argued in Chapter 3,
centrism is the uniting feature of a prominent group of lay Islamic intellectuals
in Egypt. Their activity is in large part determined by the existence of a secular
discourse that they see as a vehicle for cultural imperialism and obliteration of the
authentic Islamic self. Although this is not a rare theme in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s
books, his rhetorical investment of centrist ideology is also shaped by his role as
a religious professional. The main idea in the ideology of centrism is that Islam
represents the golden mean in all things, and shuns both exaggeration and slack-
ness. Accordingly, al-QaraÃÁwÐ dislikes radical Islamists as much as scriptural-
ists, while at the same time condemning those who break with orthodox Islamic
doctrine and those who advocate a secular society where Islam does not govern
the public domain. His openness towards modern institutions and his simultane-
ous conservatism on all issues of morals and values, coupled with his defence
of religious warfare where he considers Muslims to be attacked, perturbs many
European and US commentators, although the majority dismiss al-QaraÃÁwÐ as
a violent fundamentalist. Among religiously conscious Muslims, however, he is
considered fairly liberal, and he is sharply criticized by salafists of all persuasions,
since they think he is far too lenient in his views on issues such as interpretation of
the QurÞÁn and sunna, gender, minorities and relations with non-Muslims.
Having had his political education in a Brotherhood environment, al-QaraÃÁwÐ
is eager to transform his centrist principles into action and reform in the Arab
and Islamic worlds, hence his many activities: as chairman of various boards of
Islamic scholars, as in-house religious expert on al-JazÐra channel, and as actively
involved in the international Islamic Web site Islamonline.net. He also has his
own Web site, Qaradawi.net, which contains many of his books in electronic edi-
tions, sermons, and news about his activities. In these ways, he fills the role as an
important teacher and preacher who supports the Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda
on a different stage from the purely political one.
This role blends with his identity as a religious scholar, the one with which he
is most easily identified. Indeed, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ suits well the description that
Patrick Gaffney (1994) gives of the preacher as scholar in his brilliant typology
of three different kinds of preachers in Egyptian mosques. Gaffney identifies the
preacher in this capacity as an ‘ethical prophet’who has as his task ‘to preserve, to
codify, to interpret, and to transmit the verbal charisma of the prophet. The knowl-
edge embodied by the‘lim refers therefore to an objective closed literary heritage
recognized as ‘ilm, identified as the traditional Islamic sciences’ (ibid.: 39).
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s frequent references to collections of hadith and classical
Islamic scholarship testify to his close relationship with this ‘closed literary herit-
age’. Gaffney further qualifies the scholar-preacher as a mediator who offers the
lay public ‘the services of the specialist in the interpretation of the juridical and
religious texts’ (ibid.: 52). Al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s claim to authority is indeed premised
upon his mediating function. He regards it as his task to teach the ignorant and
The rhetoric of religious authority 55
offer advice to his fellow Azharites, but most of all to guide the young Islamic
activists, who have good intentions, but are often misguided (Krämer 2006:
199–200). His appearance and activities also conform to the ideal type of the
scholar-preacher. He wears the traditional tarbÙsh, turban and ankle-length robe
of theAzhar-educated ‘lim, and he issues fatwas on all kinds of subjects regularly
on TV and Islamonline.net. When he appears on TV, he speaks a dignified, fluent
Standard Arabic which is eloquent and understandable at the same time, although
he will often switch to the Egyptian dialect to make a more immediate impact.
However, al-QaraÃÁwÐ differs from Gaffney’s identification of the scholar-
preacher with political quietism and subservience to state policies. Like many
other ulama, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ combines pride in his profession with a polit-
ico-religious message that is clearly oppositional and intended to put pressure on
Egyptian and other Arab authorities. Indeed, with his manifold activities he upsets
the whole notion of what a preacher is, and Krämer’s characterization of him as a
scholar-cum-activist is an apt one (Krämer 2006: 190).
In his capacity as a prominent promoter of centrism and as a highly respected
religious scholar, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ has also managed to become an international
religious heavyweight. He is affiliated with a number of Islamic organizations in
Europe,Asia andAmerica, notably the European Council for Fatwa and Research,4
which is a pan-European association of Islamic scholars. In 2004, he was elected
president of the International Association of Muslim Scholars, a body composed
of various Islamic denominations aiming at establishing a global Islamic authority
characterized by centrism. However, as Gräf (2005) notes, so far the association
seems mainly to be YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s own project, and this highlights his per-
sonal ambitions of extending his scholarly authority globally.
In other words, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ seems to be attempting to fill more than one
role. In addition to his professional activity as a preacher and teacher, he has an
important politico-religious role as a spiritual guide for the Islamic revival. Lastly,
his extensive organizational activity is suggestive of a project to enhance the role
of the ulama as a professional class in the global Islamic community.
All these functions may be reflected in his discourse, but this perspective is
lacking in current research about al-QaraÃÁwÐ and other highly mediatized ulama.
Neither has the role of his discourse in relation to other Islamic discourses in the
Arab world been examined in a systematic way. One important variable to con-
sider here is naturally his rhetorical use of language. al-QaraÃÁwÐ is obviously
very concerned with language: he writes poetry and took courses in the Arabic
language while in university. However, his use of language is absent in literature
about him. A common main concern is with the tension between modernity and
tradition in his ethics, and in such analyses his rhetoric is mentioned only in pass-
ing (e.g. Wenzel-Teuber 2005: 43). Generally, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is treated as an
internationally important Islamic scholar, without placing him in a more concise
framework (e.g. Baker 2003). Supplementing such approaches, my contention is
that his rhetoric contributes to his position and function in the Islamic field in Egypt
– and not only his, but the whole array of modern shaykhs who have appeared
on satellite television during the last ten years, and who also try to combine
56 Islamist rhetoric
classical religious authority with modern concerns in order to reach a wide audi-
ence. A thorough analysis of his discourse is likely to provide a deeper insight into
the role of modern religious authorities in the Islamic field in Egypt.
Before we start analysing his discourse, let me sum up the position so far.
Ideologically speaking, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ would seem to be a centrist with
explicit Brotherhood sympathies. Professionally, he belongs to the religious elite
which the group of prominent ulama constitutes. Within this establishment, al-
QaraÃÁwÐ enjoys great respect, even though ideologically speaking he is at odds
with several other ulama. He is also popular among the Muslim public, on account
of his accessibility and modern, down-to-earth concerns. In relation to other agents
in the religious field who do not represent the establishment, there is a potential
for a sociologically determined conflict, since they might threaten the status of
the religious scholar as the one who modifies the practice and world-view of lay
people (cf. the discussion of Bourdieu in Chapter 2). In relation to agents both
outside of and inside the establishment there is an ideological conflict over how
Islam should relate to modern society. The aim of the analysis below is to provide
material that can answer the question of how YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s politico-reli-
gious ideology and socio-religious identity translate into grammar, and how this
can refine our understanding of his position in the field.
The main thematic characteristics of Ysuf al-Qarad
.w’s books
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ has written more than a hundred books on a wide range of
subjects, including some Islamic poetry. The central concern in most of them is to
explicate, theorize and discuss Islamic positions on issues relating to modern life.
Considering his role as one of the world’s most famous Islamic ulama, it is not
surprising that quite a lot of his books are dedicated to issues of revival or renewal
(interestingly, he seems to use the words interchangeably) of Islam generally, and
fiqh, ijtihd and religious discourse specifically. Even though his focus is always
on praxis, i.e. how the Islamic revival should take place within different spheres of
public and private life, his books are all written in a scholarly style, with numerous
references and a sober tone throughout.
Among the books that deal with the Islamic revival, we will focus on three
that are interventions in the long debate about Islam’s shape and role in con-
temporary society. Since al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s ideology and style have remained fairly
constant over the years, the fact that the books in question span more than
two decades is not problematic. The oldest one, al-S
.ah
.wa al-islmiyya bayn
al-jumd wa-l-tat
.arruf [The Islamic awakening between ossification and extrem-
ism] (al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001) was first published in 1982. It has become a classic of
mainstream, centrist ideology with its forceful condemnation of violent Islamism
(the book was published a year after the assassination of President Sadat). al-
QaraÃÁwÐ explains the reasons for this violent activism and offers a cure.According
to him, the Islamist youths who advocate violence and condemn other Muslims
as unbelievers do so largely because they do not have proper knowledge of Islam,
and hence the need for upright ulama to guide them. However, al-QaraÃÁwÐ admits
The rhetoric of religious authority 57
that there is good reason for their anger, and much of their criticism against current
conditions is correct. Contemporary Muslim regimes are hostile to religion, and
they have co-opted many religious scholars, al-Azhar being an obvious implicit
target of his criticism. Islam and its faithful followers are being oppressed by
the ruling and secular elites, and the reason that Muslim societies have so many
problems stems from the attempt to impose secularism on Muslim populations.
These attempts are supported and encouraged by external powers connected with
Zionism and crusaderism (s
.albiyya). Accordingly, there is a need for Islamic
activism, but an islamization of Muslim societies must take place gradually and
under the guidance of proper authorities. The book ends with a chapter that is
entitled ‘Fatherly advice to Islam’s youth’, in which he encourages young activ-
ists to listen to the elders and learn from the heroes of Islamic civilization, work
peacefully for their goal, enter into dialogue instead of confrontation, and live
among people instead of in their own isolated groups. This book can be regarded
as a cornerstone of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s work as an Islamic reformer; according
to himself it has been printed in 120,000 copies (al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 7), which is a
very high number for an Arabic book by all standards.
al-Ijtihdal-mu‘s
.irbaynal-ind
.ibt
.wa-l-infirt
.[Contemporaryijtihdbetween
discipline and dissolution] (al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998) was first published in 1994. It is
a discussion of how ijtihd is to be understood and practised today. al-QaraÃÁwÐ
argues for the view that new times raise new questions, and one of the most impor-
tant tools in the renewal of Islam is ijtihd. Thus, he contradicts those fundamen-
talists who adhere blindly to one of the four schools of fiqh and claim that the
gates of ijtihd are closed. However, it should be noted that, even though he uses
the words ‘renewal of Islam’, renewal for him is essentially renewal of fiqh only
(QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 92). Notwithstanding his position that the gates of ijtihd are
open, there is no epistemological break with orthodox thought in the sense found
in the thought of the new Islamic intellectuals. al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s call is for independ-
ent reasoning within the framework of orthodox theology. He tackles contem-
porary moral questions, for example about organ transplantation, euthanasia and
polygamy. Even in the introduction, it is clear that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ would like
to see the Islamic shar‘a govern all aspects of life, from medicine to business,
and in a legal sense, not only moral. He explicitly juxtaposes ‘Western positive
law’ with the divine shar‘a. There are two main messages in the book: firstly,
he tackles a lot of contemporary contentious issues in Islam that he thinks need
new reasoning to arrive at a judgement that is neither ossified nor heterodox. One
of the most important substantial suggestions in this regard is to institutionalize
collective ijtihd, which he has contributed to himself through his membership in
various international bodies of ulama. Secondly, he is very concerned to disqualify
other than theologically educated scholars from doing ijtihd (ibid.: 58, 96). One
of the main weapons in this struggle is accusations of ignorance, malintent or the
West’s corruptive influence. The other side of this urge to maintain the dogmatic
monopoly of the ulama is his heavy emphasis on the need for always taking the
turth into consideration and to use it actively.Accordingly, he uses the last part of
the book to criticize no less a figure than Sayyid QuÔb, who stated that the Islamic
58 Islamist rhetoric
revival was bound not by fiqh, but by the Islamic shar‘a only. YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ
claims that this statement must be interpreted in a restrained sense, and that one
should never disregard fiqh, since there is no independent entity that is called
shar‘a. Rather, the shar‘a resides partly within fiqh (ibid.: 128–129).
Khit
.bun al-islm f ‘as
.r al-‘awlama [Our Islamic discourse in the age of
globalization] (al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004) is his vision of how the call to Islam (al-da‘wa)
should relate to the historical heritage of Islam and modern society, in the form
of fifteen propositions. He goes down to the details of what words to use, such as
muwt
.in instead of dhimm, in the context of a globalized world where everyone
hears what is being said within faith communities. This book is the most practi-
cally oriented of the three works we consider here. The change in the Islamic dis-
course which he advocates is change mainly on a rhetorical level. He writes about
fifteen areas of Islam, outlining how perfectly designed it is in all respects by
referring to the QurÞÁn, sunna and turth, and then criticizes the current religious
discourse in relation to each point. All the points are characteristic of his centrist
ideology, with headlines such as ‘[The Islamic discourse] adheres to contempo-
rary life while keeping on to authenticity’ and ‘[The Islamic discourse] believes
in Revelation, but does not neglect rationality.’ In the latter chapter, he actually
states that, without rationality, belief in God is inconceivable, before going on
to the familiar theme of the conflicts between East and West and how Muslims
must stick to their own civilization and its intrinsic values. He also directs sharp
attacks against irrationalism in Islam, such as healing with the QurÞÁn and belief
in spirits, and says that reason has been given a long vacation in Islamic discourse
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 76).
Of these books, al-Ijtihd is arguably the one which requires the most knowl-
edge and insight on the part of the reader. Regardless of the slight differences in
theoretical level, however, all the books are homogeneous on both the linguistic
and the stylistic level, which seems to be the case for YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s prose
in general. Each having a slightly different focus, but all nevertheless concerned
with contemporary Islamic reform, they represent well YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s intel-
lectual activity, which spans many fields, but which retains at the same time a
homogeneous character.
Personal reference: hierarchy and conflict
One of the most pressing concerns for YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is to propagate the
Islamic da‘wa in a rational and measured idiom. One would perhaps expect him
to strive towards creating a close relationship with his readers, given his purpose
of instilling enthusiasm and zeal in the hearts and minds of Muslims generally and
Islamic activists especially. In other words, an emphasis on the pathos dimension
of the rhetorical repertoire would be likely to appear in his texts. One important
tool for achieving emotional commitment is to create close ties to the readers, and
a prime metadiscursive element in this respect is the use of pronouns to signal
closeness and intensity. How, then, does YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ use personal refer-
ence? To get an idea, let us begin simply by counting occurrences in a stretch of
The rhetoric of religious authority 59
text. The introductory chapter to his most recent book (al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 15–25)
comprises ten pages. When counting all the personal references in the chapter, we
get the following result:
I/my: 13 instances
you (sing.)/yours: 1 instance (as the implicit subject of an imperative)
he/his: 12 instances
she/her: 0 instances
we/our: 15 instances
we/our meaning I/my: 4 instances
you (pl.)/your: 0 instances
they/their: 15 instances
Somewhat surprisingly, there are almost no references to the second person.
Instead, the major pronominal references in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts are to the
third person singular and plural and the first person singular and plural. What inter-
personal meanings can be inferred from this? That question cannot be answered
merely by counting isolated instances of pronouns. They have to be interpreted in
context, and this reveals that all four references have their own significance and
contribute to making YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s discourse quite distinctive in the roles
he creates for himself and his readership.
Let us begin with the third person singular. This reference is often used in a way
that makes it a kind of substitute for the second person singular, which appears
extremely seldom in al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts. In contrast, the third person singular is
rather frequent, very often as implicitly understood, as when the explicit reference
is to the ‘ordinary’ Muslim, a category that appears quite often. Consider this
example, from a passage which is actually directed to the activist youths. YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ argues that they should focus more on the pressing social needs of
their society than power politics and struggle against the state, since helping others
is the more important duty in Islam:
It is not proper for a Muslim who sees a sick man whom he is able to offer
treatment at a public clinic or charitable hospital to refuse this until the Islamic
state is established, so that this state can take care of sick people!
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 173)
The sentence above occurs in a chapter that is explicitly addressed to Islamic
activists and that contains some references to ‘you’ in the plural (one of the rare
examples of this reference in his books). However, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ frequently
writes about the third person Muslim in more descriptive passages where the

purpose is ostensibly not to moralize, but to explain. The following examples
occur in passages that describe the nature of Islam and the characteristics of con-
temporary Islamic practice:
(...) Islam implants in the Muslim’s self (...) tolerance towards [people] with
different ideas (...)
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 102)
For the contemporary Muslim does not accept that the old [ways] remain as
they are.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 130)
Despite the third person reference to the general Muslim in all three of these
excerpts, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s detached and descriptive statements read quite
naturally as an indirect address to the reader of his text. This has to do with the
nature of his role as a religious authority preacher, and the fact that his books are
parts of his general effort to guide the Islamic awakening. His books are thus by
definition authoritative normative statements, not merely descriptions or discus-
sions about current Islamic affairs. Accordingly, the ‘contemporary Muslim’ is
none other than the reader of the book, or ‘you’, who is presented with a norma-
tive statement about how to behave. Then why does YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ avoid the
second person singular or plural, when this is the pragmatic effect that is achieved
by the reference in the third person anyway?Aplausible explanation is that, in this
way, a certain distance between him and the reader is signalled.
This has two effects. First, it makes his style more personally detached than
many other preachers’. This absence of a direct line of communication between
writer and reader is perhaps an important explanation for Gudrun Krämer’s apt
observation, which she makes in regard to his spoken discourse more than his
written one: ‘While millions have thus been able to literally form an image of him,
to see his face, listen to his voice, and observe his gestures, his is a peculiarly dis-
embodied voice’(Krämer 2006: 193). Second, considering his Azhar background,
the absence of intimacy markers might be sign of a natural inclination to write in
a scholarly idiom, where pathos has less of a role to play than ethos and logos.
In such discourse, it is natural to employ the third person singular in examples to
make them impersonal and general, like English ‘one’ and French ‘on’.
The references in the third person plural have effects of a different kind. By
default, as it were, such references denote the greatest distance from the writer
as the ‘I’ of a text, and they are often accompanied by a negative evaluation
in political discourse (Wilson 1990: 58, 68). This seems to be the case also with
al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts and, significantly, references in the third person plural are
found very frequently and at important places in his books. There are three main

groups to which this reference is regularly applied: scripturalists and radical
conservatives, liberal Islamic thinkers and ‘common people’ (al-ns). Towards
the first group, he is mildly critical; towards the second, he is severely hostile.
As for the third group, al-ns figures very often and with the same evaluation
every time: YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is clearly condescending towards it. The following
three examples illustrate the points. The first is from a passage where he criticizes
salafism:
The strange thing is that among these some allow themselves to perform
ijtihd in the most obscure matters and ambiguous issues, and to judge in
them with whatever opinion might appear correct to them, whether it is in
agreement or disagreement [with consensus]; but they do not allow special-
ized, contemporary ulama, whether alone or together, to perform ijtihd [on
the basis of] a judgement that opposes their claim.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 36)
Here, the pronoun haÞulÞ, ‘these’, is put together with a clearly negative evalua-
tion of the persons whom it refers to. YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ tends to employ the third
person plural also when he writes about liberal Islamic thinkers:
But these secularists, who pretend to be learned, consider themselves above
the Sunna of God’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and do not think it is suf-
ficient [proof] in a question like this.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 63)
And, lastly, this is an example of his reference to the common people:
It is no wonder, then, that people stumble and rise again, fail and succeed, and
it is our duty to open for them the door of hope in God’s forgiveness (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 174)

62 Islamist rhetoric
Seen in the light of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s general message about centrist renewal of
Islam and his dominant position in the Islamic field, one meaning can be read from
his references to conservatives and liberals, and another from his references to the
general public. In regard to the former, it is interesting to note that he very seldom
specifies exactly which thinkers, authors and works he has in mind when he points
to them in the third person plural. ‘They’ remain a grey mass associated with cer-
tain characteristics and actions, such as scant knowledge, a narrow frame of mind,
attacking absolute truths and pushing people away from belief. This is a rather
imprecise criticism, especially considering the fact that al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s own views
are presented in detail and with precision, with numerous references to sources
of Islamic thought (the QurÞÁn, collections of hadith and authoritative classical
Islamic treatises). Furthermore, the liberals who are targets of his criticism are as
a rule much more open and concrete about what and whom they criticize. NaÒr
ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd, for example, generally provides specific names and references
in his criticisms of conservative religious thought instead of employing the vague
pronoun ‘they’ (e.g. AbÙ Zayd 2003, where al-QaraÃÁwÐ is incidentally one of his
two main targets).
What might the reason for this imprecision be, from a rhetorical point of view?
There are two likely explanations. First, the contrast between the precision with
which he presents his own views and the vague mass of differing opinions makes
the latter seem marginal and irrelevant, compared to the detailed exposition of the
former. In this way he belittles the people he disagrees with, whether they are con-
servatives or liberals. It is interesting to note in this regard that in spite of the fact
that both non-Muslim scholars and Muslim activists frequently describe him as
perhaps the greatest Islamic ‘lim of our time, there is little in al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s writ-
ings that would substantiate this claim. He rarely goes into details about epistemo-
logical and theological controversies, and his refutations of both conservative and
liberal approaches to the Islamic holy texts rely on trite arguments that are seldom
pursued in any detail. The contrast to a comparable figure like the late shaykh
MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ is striking, and I will return to this issue in Chapter 7.
Here, it is sufficient to remark that al-QaraÃÁwÐ denies his intellectual opponents
the honour of a detailed refutation based on specific claims by specific authors or
intellectual tendencies. Second, the widespread use of ‘they’ corresponds to an
equally widespread use of ‘us’, as we saw at the beginning of this section, and the
two may profitably be seen in connection. When al-QaraÃÁwÐ uses ‘we’ or ‘us’
in an inclusive sense, i.e. including both himself and the reader, he usually refers
to one of four pairs of contradictions: all Muslims as opposed to ‘the West’ and
Judaism, centrists as opposed to fundamentalists, centrists as opposed to liber-
als, and conscious, activist Muslims as opposed to the ignorant masses. Here are
examples of all four contrasts:

The rhetoric of religious authority 63
It is the hellish, frightful trinity that conspires against our umma, and whose
forces rally together against us like hungry ones gather around the eating
bowl, the trinity of Judaism, crusaderism and communism (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 94)
We even find among these some who claim that lawful [shar‘] money is gold
and silver (...), so, as for bank notes, they are not considered money in a shar‘
sense.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 95)
Contrary to these ossified ultraconservatives we find the loose and slack ones,
who want us to be stripped of our whole heritage, both the divine and human
aspects of it, and that we be bound by neither text nor principle (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 133)
And here we find that, if we were to leave the definition of ‘religious extrem-
ism’ to the views and whims of ordinary people, we would lose our direction
[our paths would become scattered for us] (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 31)
There is an evident construal of a world of conflicts in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s divi-
sion between ‘us’ and ‘them’, made very visible by the juxtaposition of the two
references in the same sentence in all the examples above. Its effect is to divide the
world into different communities according only to religious criteria, and the cen-
trist community implicitly signified by the ‘we’is self-evidently the only one that is
right and good. The dichotomy between one group and another – ‘us’and ‘them’– is
an effective way of making the readers identify with al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s own positions.
Casting a ‘we’and several ‘others’in the way al-QaraÃÁwÐ does here encourages the
reader to take his side by virtue of implicit rhetorical claims in addition to or even
instead of arguments: al-QaraÃÁwÐ claims to represent the reader by the use of an
inclusive ‘we’ over and against other groups. One of the clearest examples of how
al-QaraÃÁwÐ takes the liberty to represent the attitudes and opinions of his readers

is the heading of a chapter in his book on modern ijtihd, cited below. Given that
the book which the quote is taken from is in essence an extensive argument about
the legitimate use of ijtihd in contemporary Islam, the default way of phrasing a
proposition about what he believes to be correct ijtihd would simply be: ‘the desir-
able ijtihd for our time’, or something along those lines. However, by including the
‘we’in this heading, al-QaraÃÁwÐ claims to represent his readers.
The ijtihd we desire for our time
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 23)
If there is a hint in the example above of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ construing himself as
a universal Islamic religious leader, the references to ‘al-ns’ in his texts provide
even more substantial proof for such a claim. Naturally, they also contribute to
creating a dichotomy between us and them. However, this dichotomy is between
the chosen few and the ignorant many instead of the rightly guided centrists versus
the errant scripturalists and liberals. In other words, it is a contrast defined not in
terms of ideology, but in terms of sociology. This can be seen clearly in the exam-
ples above that refer to al-ns, repeated here:
It is no wonder, then, that people stumble and rise again, fail and succeed, and
it is our duty to open for them the door of hope in God’s forgiveness.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 174)
And here we find that, if we were to leave the definition of ‘religious extrem-
ism’ to the views and whims of ordinary people, we would lose our direction
[our paths would become scattered for us] (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 31)
It is up to an ‘us’ that is obviously composed of al-QaraÃÁwÐ and his readers to
define religious concepts and open the doors of hope to the stumbling mass of
ignorant lay people. The relation between the ‘we’ and the ‘other’ in this case is
not hostile, as in the other three pairs of contrast; instead, al-QaraÃÁwÐ here cre-
ates a pyramidal vision of the Islamic field. At the bottom are the common peo-
ple, ‘al-ns’. Above them is a layer of religiously aware Muslims, the ones who
read al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books. He himself is at the apex, guiding the zealous Islamic

revivalists in how they should lead the common people on the straight path. As I
have already mentioned, the last part of his important book al-S
.ah
.wa al-islmiyya
bayn al-jumd wa-l-tat
.arruf is dedicated to giving advice to young Islamic activ-
ists, and this part, bearing the title ‘Fatherly advice to Islam’s youth’, supports the
picture of a hierarchic vision of the field.
So does YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s use of the first person singular, which is the last
reference I comment on here. It is also the use of this reference that shows most
clearly how al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s rhetoric is dominated not by pathos, but by ethos: the
construction of himself as credible and authoritative. While mostly writing about
a collective ‘we’, al-QaraÃÁwÐ sometimes singles himself out as an Actor, and this
generally happens when he casts himself as a spiritual and political guide. In the
example below, al-QaraÃÁwÐ recounts that, during an international Islamic confer-
ence, one speaker criticized the concept of dialogue between religions, since in his
view there is no other religion than Islam:
Beside me sat the chairman of the conference, so I said to him: ‘What this
speaker said is dangerous. It might distort the picture of this conference and
its positive tendency if he is not refuted.’He answered: ‘What he said remains
between us and the walls of the conference hall.’
I retorted: That is a false claim on two accounts.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 19)
He then goes on to list these two reasons, namely, that there are journalists from
newspapers and TV present at the conference, and that Islam does acknowledge
other religions. This little story is meant to illustrate a point al-QaraÃÁwÐ has
just made about how globalization makes it imperative for contemporary Muslims
to understand that they never speak only to themselves, but also to non-Muslims,
and that current Islamic discourse should reflect this fact.At the same time, stories
like these represent one of the few means al-QaraÃÁwÐ uses to add a personal touch
to his prose, which is generally written in a distinctly impersonal tone. However,
rather than using self-mention to create personal ties with the reader, al-QaraÃÁwÐ
writes himself into the role of the moral and intellectual hero, thus boosting
his authority and credibility as an independent-minded and outspoken religious
leader. His other main way of using self-mention is when he throws his personal
weight behind exhortations in his texts. The context is usually one where he states
his opinion on some phenomenon or other in Islam, or what Islamic discourse
and certain Islamic practices should be like. Below is an example of the latter,
which is taken, symptomatically, from the chapter with advice to the young Islamic

activists in al-S
.ah
.wa al-islmiyya bayn al-jumd wa-l-tat
.arruf that I referred to
above:
I advise these youths, firstly, that they respect expertise, for each science has
its professionals and each art its performers (...)
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 158)
This advice is given to young Muslim activists in order that they do not go astray
and become violent or unreasonable in their call to Islam. When he recounts things
he has said during conferences or in Islamic associations somewhere, that is also an
assembly of the Islamic ‘elite’. Consequently, the ‘I’ who talks to third persons or
to the reader in al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts is not meant to make the writer communicate
horizontally instead of vertically to the reader, as it were, but is instead indicative
of al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s role as a spiritual guide who gives advice to a vanguard of Islamic
activists and scholars about how they should relate to the general public, which is in
need of constant guidance. In this way, al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s use of ‘I’contributes to creat-
ing a vision of the Islamic field where he occupies a supreme position.
To conclude: YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ casts himself as the objective and distanced
scholar with his many references to the reader in the third person. At the same time,
he creates a picture of conflict and hierarchy in the religious field, where his own
role is not at all that of the distanced observer. His use of the third person plural
belittles the people with whom he disagrees, and the combination of this reference
and the first person plural encourages the reader to identify with a clearly defined
ideological group, opposed to the grey mass of common people, scripturalists and
liberals alike. Within this group,YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is construed as being at the apex
of an Islamic pyramidal structure, where common Muslims make up the base.
Grammatical mood as a tool for prescribing Islamic
practice and conveying authority
The prevalent mood structures in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s prose support the picture
of him as an accomplished religious scholar. His style is in many respects the most
restrained of the three writers we consider here, and he generally avoids exclama-
tions and vocatives, adopting instead a measured, impersonal tone.Although there
are some interrogatives and rare instances of imperatives, they never dot the text in
the same way as with many other preachers, religious scholars and even intellectu-
als (we will see examples of all three later). Recalling Halliday’s mood scheme in
Chapter 2, we can say that he does not demand any action from his readers, and
only seldom information, conveyed by the use of questions. He communicates
mainly by offering information in the form of propositions. When he does employ
questions they are more often than not used in a pedagogical way, to prepare the

ground for yet another explanation. The following passage from the beginning of
a section about the reasons for religious extremism is typical:
Here we join the chorus of voices asking what are the reasons and motives
that lead to this extremism or excess in religion?
A comprehensive view on the reasons for extremism:
The truth is that there is no single reason for extremism. Rather, there are
many different reasons, and it would not do justice to the facts to concentrate
on one reason and ignore the others, as everybody who belongs to a specific
school of thought normally does.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 49)
Questions such as these undoubtedly involve the reader in some way by mak-
ing her/him feel that s/he is participating in the flow of discourse. However, there
are other, much more intensely interpersonal ways of using questions, as we shall
see in the texts of both ÝAmr KhÁlid and MuÎammad ÝImÁra. Accordingly, al-
QaraÃÁwÐ’s questions do not really contradict the impression of a distanced and
detached author given by his use of personal pronouns. al-QaraÃÁwÐ uses this
restrained and detached style throughout in his books, and moulds an academic
discourse that consists of descriptive arguments and reflections about a well-ordered
bullet list of issues.
However, the fact that his style is descriptive and that there are very few impera-
tives in his books does not mean that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts are not strongly
normative. Quite the contrary is the case, but in this area his way of moulding
his discourse interplays in subtle ways with his position as an internationally
renowned Islamic authority. The normative streak in his discourse is realized by
different means. The most obvious ones are what Badawi, Carter and Gully call
impersonal verbs (2004: 394) and negative particles. We will first look at two
examples of how he uses impersonal verbs and negative particles to prescribe
rather than describe. Consider the following sentences:

68 Islamist rhetoric
The ijtihd in our era should be a collective one, in the shape of an academy
of highly qualified religious scholars (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 16)
The contemporary religious jurist must choose from the mentioned opinions
one which he finds probable, and not leave [ordinary] people in bewilderment
between one opinion and its opposite.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 25)
In the first sentence, the verb yanbagh, ‘it is desirable/necessary’, has only one
argument, namely the verbal sentence that comes after it, and, as often is the case
in Arabic, modality is expressed by a lexical verb that corresponds to a whole
clause in English. This sentence is clearly normative, although responsibility is
not placed anywhere for making the academy of ulama to come about, in which
case it would have had an imperative effect. As for the phrase l budda li, ‘[some-
one] must do [something]’, it is explicitly imperative, being implicitly addressed
to a specific Actor, namely the contemporary religious jurist. This kind of norma-
tive statement is found often in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books, and reflects the fact
that, besides offering scholarly, descriptive accounts of contemporary Islam, he
is also concerned to guide its current beliefs and practices. However, unlike ÝAmr
KhÁlid, who is also a preacher, al-QaraÃÁwÐ occupies himself not with individu-
als, but with the whole Islamic umma. Hence, he does not address his demands to
the reader, but to abstract entities such as ‘the interpretive effort’ or generalized
third persons such as ‘the contemporary religious jurist’, as we can see from the
sentences above. In this way, as we saw in the section ‘Personal reference: hierar-
chy and conflict’, the individual reader again disappears in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwi’s
discourse to the benefit of the collective. He very explicitly casts himself as a
supreme guide for the whole Islamic community.
The fact that he devises such an authoritative role for himself is not without
implications for how one can interpret his seemingly descriptive propositions. For,
in light of this role, al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s plain statements about what Islam is and what
Muslims do can be said to communicate even more authority than the overtly
imperative sentences we just looked at. Consider again the statement about the
ordinary Muslim which I quoted above in the section ‘Personal reference: hierar-
chy and conflict’, as well as a new example:
For the contemporary Muslim does not accept that the old [ways] remain as
they are.

The rhetoric of religious authority 69
[The Islamic discourse] believes in Revelation without discarding rationality.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 65)
These are propositions without explicit modality; they simply state facts about the
contemporary Muslim and Islamic discourse. However, since YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ
is a religious authority who clearly has ambitions to guide the entire Sunni Muslim
world on what he believes to be the straight path of centrism, these propositions
acquire a modalized imperative effect when seen in context. That is to say, the sen-
tences can have two simultaneous meanings: they may be taken at face value, but
they may also mean that the ‘contemporary Muslim should not accept...’ and that
‘The Islamic discourse should believe in Revelation...’5
By using the generalized
third person reference together with plain propositions about what a Muslim does
and what he does not do, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ at once prescribes correct action for
a Muslim and asserts his ability to actually define what a contemporary Muslim
is and does. The latter function presupposes and communicates more authority
than only stating what the contemporary Muslim should be and do, which is also
implicit in this formulation. He could have chosen to write something along the
lines of ‘I do not think contemporary Muslims should accept that the old ways
remain as they are’or, in a more reader-oriented fashion, ‘We should not accept as
contemporary Muslims that...’ Both these options are seen quite often in contem-
porary, normative Islamic literature, whether the writer is an accomplished ‘lim
or a lay preacher. However, by taking the liberty to define what the contemporary
Muslim accepts and does not accept, al-QaraÃÁwÐ delivers the implicit message
that a Muslim who does not act in the way he instructs that s/he should act is
somehow lacking in ‘Muslimness’. By the same token Islamic discourses that do
not conform to the fifteen characteristics he describes in his book about Islamic
discourse (QaraÃÁwÐ 2004) are not really or fully Islamic. Significantly, these sen-
tences are devoid of any hint of modality; they allow for no possibility to voice
another opinion and appear as completely definitive statements. Consequently,
what al-QaraÃÁwÐ does by formulating himself in this way is to act as the final
arbiter or judge in all questions Islamic. We can conclude that, on the one hand,
the mood features of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts contribute to making them appear
strongly prescriptive, both by virtue of the words themselves and by virtue of
his already acknowledged position as a religious authority in Islam. On the other
hand, his normative statements about Islam and Muslims are phrased in such a
way as to enhance the image of him as a superior authority of Islamic doctrine
and practice. This fact further strengthens his ethos, which is mainly built on his
authority as a religious professional.
Style and authority
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s style of writing is distinctive and bears witness to a high
degree of rhetorical awareness and appreciation. Writing generally in a clear and
[
X \ ! >^?	 73
. [*- ]
70 Islamist rhetoric
easily understandable style, as we have seen in the examples above, al-QaraÃÁwÐ
nevertheless often displays a reverence for the rhetorical repository that the herit-
age of Arabic religious discourse represents, and he makes active use of quite a
few sophisticated techniques. This is apparent both in his own style of writing
and in his quotations. To take the latter first: citations of other sources are not
restricted to the QurÞÁn and collections of hadith, as is often the case in Arabic
Islamic books for a general audience. Besides quoting from time to time some of
the great religious thinkers in the classical Islamic age, a regular feature in YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts is his quotation from a piece of poetry to illustrate a point. These
quotations are more often than not taken from classical, Islamic Arabic poetry, as
here:
ÝÀÞisha, may God be pleased with her, recited LabÐd Ibn RabÐÝa’s verse:
They have gone in whose courts one lived happily / And I remain behind
like scabby skin!
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 32)6
Such quotations require quite a lot of literary knowledge on the part of YÙsuf al-
QaraÃÁwÐ to be able to use them in an illuminating way and in suitable places, and
quite a lot of poetic awareness on the part of the readers for them to appreciate
it. In addition to this, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s own language exhibits a clear concern
with eloquence. Rhyme and repetition are important features of his texts. Consider
this comment on Arab political leaders:
For these [rulers] appear outwardly to the youths as national leaders,
jealous of their homelands. But inwardly they are hired collaborators, attack-
ing the religion of their nation, working to the benefit of its [the nation’s]
enemies!
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 95)
By topicalizing the adverbial phrases and postponing the predicates and verbs,
which all end on the plural suffix -Ùn, the text achieves a suggestive effect that
intensifies the feeling in the statement. In other words, we are talking here of a
classic way of exploiting pathos to persuade the readers. Similarly, al-QaraÃÁwÐ
actively exploits the poetic possibilities that the root system in Arabic gives, as in
this statement about correct ijtihd:

The rhetoric of religious authority 71
So it does not exaggerate with the extremists, nor does it fall short with those
who are incompetent.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 93)
These rhymes and repetitions are typical of eloquent modernArabic prose (Justice
1987; Johnstone 1991), and it testifies to al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s awareness of and respect
for the Arabic rhetorical tradition that he incorporates many such ornamentations
in his texts.
How do his stylistic characteristics impinge on the construction of himself as
writer and his readers? What is immediately clear is that the quotations of poetry,
the rhyming and the repetitions set YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts clearly apart from
certain other genres in Islamic literature meant for a non-specialized audience,
and especially what has been termed ‘the Islamic book’ by Gonzalez-Quijano in
his study about the field of book production in contemporary Egypt (Gonzalez-
Quijano 1993: 413–423). Covering such areas as the unseen, the end of the world,
the soul in the Hereafter and how to raise children, these books are written in
simple Modern Written Arabic, tending towards a vernacular style. They are the
decidedly most popular literature among ordinary people, or al-ns, the group
of people al-QaraÃÁwÐ refers to in his books rather dismissively, and
which he relates to only indirectly through the religiously conscious people
and the activists he ostensibly writes his books for. Tellingly, al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s
books are not sold primarily in the bookstalls on the streets of Cairo, like the
‘Islamic books’. Instead, they are sold in normal bookshops in the city centre
and religious bookshops in middle- and upper-class areas in al-MuhandisÐn
and al-DuqqÐ. Accordingly, we can conclude that, in addition to being the only
forceful vehicle for pathos in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts, his use of time-honoured
poetic devices contributes to his ethos as a no-nonsense religious scholar who
attends to the spiritual needs of Muslims who take an intellectual interest in their
religion.
In addition to this his style contributes to setting him and the establishment of
ulama apart from other high-brow literature about Islamic thought and practice.
For example, MuÎammad ÝImÁra writes in plain, but eloquent, Arabic, as we shall
soon see, and, even if he sometimes includes poetic quotations or classical rhe-
torical figures, such effects are not used by him to a significant degree. And the
prose of NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd, who is also a very visible character in the field of
Islamic literature, is certainly complex, but his style is a sober and academic one,
where rhymes and repetitions do not figure.
This fact points to an interesting variation in contemporary Arabic persuasive
prose, which we shall return to in Chapter 7. Here, I would like to note merely
that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ distinguishes himself from these other intellectual Islamic
writers by what Egyptian academics I met termed ‘fus
.h
. turthiyya’, ‘heritage
Arabic’. The term seems to have religious connotations, and, as we shall see in
Chapter 7, the use of classical poetry, rhyme and topicalizations is part and parcel
of other ulama’s rhetorical repository as well. It is reasonable to presume that
the use of these rhetorical tools in the context of religious literature draws on
72 Islamist rhetoric
images of the religiously salient dogma of the inimitability of the QurÞÁn and the
attendant great concern for elegance and style in religious Arabic writing from
very early on. Gaffney’s (1994) descriptions of Azhar-educated mosque preachers
and their superior command of fus
.h
. in comparison with lay preachers support
this presumption. Accordingly, the construction of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s identity
as an official guardian of tradition and inherited religious knowledge takes place
very visibly in the area of style. It is also noteworthy that his style presupposes
a reader who appreciates his stylistic choices, a reader who is comfortable with
this paradigm of communication. In other words, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s style is
a way of reconfirming a discourse community that adheres to traditional ways
of expressing religious thought and, consequently, a traditional view of who can
talk in the name of religion, since using this style requires a specific religious and
cultural capital. This agreement takes place in a religious field that has become
increasingly diversified, especially during the last thirty years, with its explosion
of modes of thought and expression.
Definitions and exclusions as functions of syntax
How does al-QaraÃÁwi construe Islam, Muslims and other concepts that are con-
nected to them? Who are the important Actors associated with different process
types, and how are they portrayed? These are the central questions in this section.
Let us begin by outlining the characteristic transitivity patterns that relate to Islam
and Muslims in al-QaraÃÁwi’s texts. Consider the following example, from a para-
graph about how to deal with religious extremism:
Instead what is necessary is to talk with confused intellects until they are set
right, and to persevere in friendly dialogue until misunderstanding ceases and
comprehension dawns in the eyes. Even if they carry weapons these weapons
should be taken from them instead of using them to hurt them.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2001: 114)
A conspicuous feature in al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s discourse is his widespread use of pas-
sives and verbal nouns, a feature that reduces the amount of direct and explicit
agency in his texts. Instead, it is the processes and the issues that are affected by
these processes which often occupy centre stage. In the quote above the emphasis
is on processes, not on agency. Accordingly, in the first clause, the verbal nouns
mukht
.aba (talk) and h
.iwr (dialogue) are used to describe what must be done,
thus obscuring who is supposed to undertake these actions. Verbal nouns like these
and passives (yuÞkhadhu (taken) in this excerpt) are found scattered throughout

The rhetoric of religious authority 73
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books. He employs them in many different contexts, and
about all kinds of issues and participants. They contribute to giving his texts the
impersonal, academic flavour that is also achieved by his pronoun use. Another
feature of the transitivity patterns that corresponds to his pronoun use is that, when
there are prominent Actors, there is a prevalence of concepts and groups instead
of individual thinkers, activists or institutions. For example, where ÝAmr KhÁlid
focuses on the Muslim as Actor (cf. Chapter 5), YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ emphasizes
Islam:
It was not Islam that produced this reality, but rather it was produced in Islam’s
absence from guiding life through legislation and instruction, under the influ-
ence of foreign invasion in all its material and moral aspects.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 96)
[Islam] makes Man continually connected to God, (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 91)
Islam was obliged in the end to unsheathe the sword in self-defence, (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 113)
Islam cares about the moral aspect, and considers it one of the fruits of faith,
or indeed as one of the intrinsic parts of faith.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 94)
In al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books, it is first and foremost Islam which acts, and not the
Muslims.The two last examples are strongly anthropomorphic.YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ
describes Islam as a person unsheathing his sword to defend himself. Islam is con-
strued as a person on the spiritual level, too, as we can see in the last example,
where the process is mental instead of material, and depicts Islam as judging and
thinking. In other words, in al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts, Islam is construed as a person
who acts in the world. Of course, Islam has not in some magical way produced any
political or social reality, nor was it Islam that unsheathed its sword in the seventh
century; it was persons inspired by and representing the religion in one way or

another who did it. As everybody knows, persons inspired by and representing
Islam have also killed innocents and committed other acts of brutality through-
out history. However, by obscuring human agency when it suits him, YÙsuf al-
QaraÃÁwÐ is able to create a religious divide between what he thinks is good and
correct and what he disapproves of. The former is identified as being done, said or
ordained by Islam, while the latter is associated with humans: extremist Islamist
groups, conservatives, secularists and imperialists.
On the whole, he has a preference for casting groups, concepts and general-
ized characters as Actors instead of individual persons or institutions. As I argued
above, modern ijtihd and the contemporary faqh are examples of a concept and
a generalized character, while the recurrent references to ‘ossified’(jmidn) con-
servatives and ‘excessive’ (ghult) liberals show his preoccupations with groups.
In the recent book Khit
.bun al-islm f ‘as
.r al-‘awlama (al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004), the
concept ‘Islamic discourse’is cast asActor throughout the book. The textual effect
of his preference for such entities as Actors is that people are backgrounded while
doctrine is foregrounded.
Considering YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s textual emphasis on doctrine, it is interesting
to examine if any particular kind of process is prominent in relation to this issue,
and how it is employed. It turns out that he uses relational processes in a signifi-
cant way. Consider the following examples:
One of the characteristics of our Islamic discourse in the era of globalization
[is] that it believes in Revelation without discarding rationality.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 65)
These [are] some of the fundamental features and restrictions for contempo-
rary ijtihd.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 98)
The true mujtahid is he who represents authenticity and contemporaneity
together, (...).
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 72)
All these sentences are what Functional Grammar describes as relational. In
Halliday’s words, relational sentences are about ‘being’and ‘having’(Halliday 2004:
210). Here, I am concerned with those which are about ‘being’, and which appear
very often when YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ writes about ideological and doctrinal ques-

tions around which there is some debate.According to Halliday, relational sentences
‘serve to characterize and identify’ (ibid.). This is exactly what al-QaraÃÁwÐ does:
he characterizes and identifies central religious concepts such as contemporary
ijtihd and Islamic discourse. At this point, it is useful to recall the discussion
about the simultaneously descriptive and normative character of his texts in the
previous section. Given YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s position as an established authority
of orthodoxy in the Islamic field, the very act of characterizing and identifying at
once asserts his power to do so and serves to disqualify discourses that do not con-
form to his own descriptions. The latter function is made all the stronger by the
fact that al-QaraÃÁwÐ seldom names specific thinkers with whom he disagrees (of
whom there are quite a few, among both liberals and conservatives) and, indeed,
seldom treats in any detail thoughts on ijtihd and other issues that oppose his
own. In this way, he boosts his own authority while disempowering the reader. By
‘disempowering the reader’ I mean that the way he construes his own opinion as
the definition of Islam, combined with the absence of a discussion of his own and
others’ views, makes it hard for the reader to reflect critically – s/he is implicitly
encouraged not to reflect at all, but simply to take al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s assertions at face
value.
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ uses relational processes to monopolize authority in another
way as well. In a telling section of the book al-Ijtihd al-mu‘s
.ir bayn al-ind
.ibt
.
wa-l-infirt
. (al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998), he outlines three different approaches to ijtihd.
One he calls the direction of restriction and harshness (tad
.yq and tashdd), and
describes it as preoccupied with the letter of the text instead of its meaning and
slavishly bound to one of the four classical schools of law in Sunni Islam. The other
is characterized by being excessive in making religion comfortable (al-ghuluww
f-l-tawassu‘), and misinterprets the religious text in order to arrive at conclusions
that are suited to present-day ideologies. The third is the centrist approach, which
al-QaraÃÁwÐ describes thus:

3 – The well-balanced direction, or the school of wasat
.iyya:
The third direction is the ‘centrist’school, or the well-balanced or moderate
school, which unites the two concerns of following the texts and attending to
the intention of the shar‘a. Accordingly, it does not oppose the whole to the
partial or the certain to the supposed. It provides for humankind’s welfare, on
the condition that this does not entail contradicting a [holy] text that is une-
quivocal, or a religious principle that is agreed upon by ijm‘. Consequently,
it unites the prescriptions of religious law with the exigencies of [a given]
epoch.
This direction is the sound direction that our nation [Þumma] needs. (...)
And this is the direction of those who possess knowledge and are pious and
moderate, these being the necessary characteristics for anyone who ventures
to pronounce a fatwa and speak in the name of religious law, especially in
our time.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 97)
In this excerpt, the four relational clauses form a logical chain, and in order to
clearly see the links between them it is useful to show the functional analysis in
full. I have omitted the process slot in the analysis, since, in Arabic, equational
sentences such as these are realized simply by juxtaposing the constituents, both
in the independent case, and inserting the d
.amr al-fas
.l between them (Badawi,
Carter and Gully 2004: 338–339):
The first sentence is the more neutral one (for details about Value and Token,
see the presentation of relational processes in Chapter 2), since the Token here is
just a number in a bullet list. There is some mild evaluation at work (the ‘balanced’
and ‘moderate’ direction), but it is in the next three clauses that the evaluation
really becomes contentious. The following two clauses take the Value of the first

clause and make it into a Token of a wider set of Values, and here the tone changes
and becomes strongly normative, even exclusive. If the centrist school represents
the ‘sound direction’ in ijtihd, as the second sentence claims, then other direc-
tions are surely not sound. This kind of statement is common enough; one cannot
blame people for having preferences and stating them. However, when the centrist
school is then said to represent the direction of those who are learned, pious and
moderate, it is a much stronger judgement, since it disqualifies not other view-
points, but other persons. Lastly, these three characteristics (knowledge, piety and
moderation) are said to represent necessary preconditions for anyone who wants
to talk in the name of the divine law. Logically, then, it is only centrists who have
this right, since it is by implication they who possess the necessary preconditions.
In the course of this little excerpt, and while using a structure that seems the same
in the four clauses, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ suddenly – and subtly, since the surface
structure is still the same – changes the issue at stake from viewpoints, which
it is normal to disagree on, to persons, and proceeds to effectively eliminate as
participants in the debate everybody who is not part of the centrist paradigm.
This is power-wielding that stands in stark contrast to the assertions about
openness and tolerance that al-QaraÃÁwÐ and other prominent centrists often
repeat.
What al-QaraÃÁwÐ does both here and through the other relational processes we
analysed above is to make his own opinions the definition of contemporary Islam.
As a consequence of this, one can say that his language contributes to construing
the Islamic religious field as a pyramidal structure, with himself on top, enjoying
the power to define correct belief and practice as well as who is allowed to join the
field of religious thought. The ideational aspects of his discourse work together
with the mood structures in creating this effect. Considering the fact that his books
are published in an atmosphere of ‘lively debate’about Islam and culture in Egypt
(Polka 2003: 58) and are clearly meant as interventions in this debate, their author-
itative tone is a slap in the face to al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s opponents, be they liberal or
conservative.
Conclusion
The two main results of this analysis are that, first, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ constructs
his authority not only by virtue of his merits and the content of his discourse,
but also by the way in which he frames this discourse. He stays at a distance to
his readership and produces an image of a strongly hierarchical Islam where his
readers are a collective in need of guidance from above for their politico-religious
task of reviving Islam to be achieved. This is apparent in all the three areas of his
language that we have investigated. Second – and this point correlates with the
first – he uses this authority to determine who are legitimate players in the field
and who are not, and through his language makes his judgements seem like natu-
ral necessities. In this way, he excludes liberal Islamic thinkers and casts serious
doubts on the credibility of other Islamic scholars who oppose him. This becomes
clear especially in the transitivity analysis.
78 Islamist rhetoric
In a perceptive article on YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s view on apostasy, Gudrun
Krämer notes that,
In spite of his insistence on action rather than mere talk as the sign of the
committed Muslim, QaraÃÁwÐ is essentially a man of the word, whose influ-
ence derives largely from his omnipresence on the stage and the sheer volume
of his published work. Here as elsewhere, form matters as much as content.
With all his learning and the prestige derived from it, QaraÃÁwÐ does not come
across as a scholar, but as a preacher, teacher and major media character who
reaches out to the common man and woman.
(Krämer 2006: 193)
The analysis I have carried out here gives reason both to agree and to disagree
with Krämer. The content of al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s discourse decidedly places him in the
category of a ‘preacher’and ‘teacher’more than a scholar: Although it is apparent
that he is very learned, his works are unoriginal, and there are no incisive analyses
or attempts at theory-building anywhere. We would also agree with the statement
that form matters as much as content. However, the analysis carried out here sug-
gests that one of the main functions of the form of al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s language is to
emphasize rather than diminish his role as an accomplished scholar – mitigat-
ing in a way the impression given by the relatively simple content of his books.
So, speaking on the basis of form, he very much comes across as a scholar. His
rhetoric is centred on building an ethos of the accomplished religious scholar to a
remarkable degree, and an interesting question is how it compares to the rhetoric
of other religious scholars in this respect. This is one of the issues we will explore
in the comparative analysis in Chapter 7.
5 The rhetoric of religious
passion
The figure of ÝAmr KhÁlid (b. 1967) is interesting not only because he is the most
famous and popular of the new preachers. He has also moved Islamist culture in
new directions and can in some ways be said to be a one-man movement. His early
history as a preacher typifies the traits of ‘Market Islam’ (described in Chapter 3).
He used to listen to the first really famous new preacher, ÝUmar ÝAbd al-KÁfÐ, in
the exclusive social club NÁdÐ al-Ñayd (the Shooting Club), which is located in
an affluent neighbourhood between the areas of al-MuhandisÐn and al-DuqqÐ in
central Cairo. When ÝUmar ÝAbd al-KÁfÐ was forced to stop preaching after some
political and religious controversy surrounding his stance towards Christians, the
religiously awakened ÝAmr KhÁlid was asked by his friends to step in for him at the
club. ÝAmr KhÁlid’s simple preaching, which focuses on narratives and personal
bonding, coupled with his relaxed and amiable nature, soon drew great numbers
of people to the little mosque inside the club. Subsequently, he was hosted by al-
ÍuÒarÐ Islamic Foundation, which is run by a former movie star, YasmÐn al-ÍuÒarÐ,
who is the daughter of one of Egypt’s most famous QurÞÁn reciters.
At this point, the authorities started creating problems for him and forced him
to move his meetings to the suburb of 6th of October City. This did not prevent his
followers from showing up at his meetings, and eventually he was given the choice
of giving up preaching or leaving Egypt. It is still unclear why the authorities
wanted to silence him. At any rate, he chose the latter option and left for Britain,
where he started studying religious relations at the University of Cardiff. Today,
relations with the state seem to have calmed, and he divides his time between
Egypt and Britain. All the time he has been busy producing TV shows and giving
lectures in various Arab countries, supervising different social projects and visit-
ing branches in the Arab world and Europe of the informal organization ÑunnÁÝ
al-ÎayÁ (Lifemakers), which sprang out of one of his early talk shows.
LuÔfÐ (2005) and Haenni (2005) have contributed stimulating research about how
the new preachers represent and nurture a culture of consumerism and globaliza-
tion in Egypt and the Arab world. However, ÝAmr KhÁlid and the religious culture
he has created also have political significance. For example, in the winter and
spring of 2006, Arab and Muslim countries were in uproar against Danish news-
paper cartoons that insulted the prophet MuÎammad and subsequently appeared
in a number of prominent European newspapers. Freedom of speech and deep-felt
80 Islamist rhetoric
religious sentiments were put at loggerheads, and the dominant reaction to the
insults inArab countries was boycott and alienation. The natural fires of anger and
hatred among the public were fanned by governments which exploited the clash in
order to achieve the credibility and religious legitimacy which they sorely lack. In
this situation, and after much media pressure, ÝAmr KhÁlid took the initiative and
set up a dialogue conference in Copenhagen in order to promote mutual under-
standing and sympathy between Muslims and non-Muslims. He was criticized
by such Egyptian Islamist heavyweights as YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and the independ-
ent Islamist essayist FahmÐ HuwaydÐ, who held the view that only unconditional
regret from both editors and governments in Europe was acceptable. However, the
grand muftÐ ÝAlÐ JumÝa supported the initiative, as did the great Islamic author-
ity in Syria, shaykh SaÝÐd RamaÃÁn al-BÙÔÐ.1
These events cast KhÁlid in a more
explicitly political role, as an agent in the religious field who does not shy away
from opposing authorities in the field and taking on tasks that have a clear politi-
cal character.
In addition, they highlighted a characteristic of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s ideology that has
become more and more apparent in recent years, but is not focused on in existing
research: the will to dialogue and cross-religious cooperation. This is an important
trademark that distinguishes his otherwise rather conservative discourse from the
more xenophobic discourse of the American Christian right, with which Patrick
Haenni compares the new Islamic preachers. On several occasions, KhÁlid has
emphasized the importance of tolerance and coexistence, both within the Islamic
umma and between it and the West. His appearance as guest at the Coptic celebra-
tion of Christmas in January 2008,2
in a situation where the Coptic Church has
complained bitterly about state indifference to sectarian violence targeting Copts,
served to confirm the impression that dialogue and understanding have become
major concerns for him. The dialogue conference in Copenhagen and the visit to
the Coptic Church also, and importantly, cast him in the role of spokesman for
Muslims generally. His openness has earned him the respect of independent intel-
lectual circles, as is apparent from the sympathetic coverage of him during the
cartoon crisis in the liberal and independent weekly al-Dustr.3
As for his own
attitude to the role of spokesman, he has explicitly compared his position to that
of great reformers in modern Arab history, who often met with strong resistance
from their societies.4
At the same time, this role represents a kind of encroachment
on territory that has previously been reserved for the religious establishment and
the Muslim Brotherhood, and this explains the lack of enthusiasm for him in such
circles to some degree.
Given the idea of a ‘fragmentation of authority in Islam’ (Eickelman and
Piscatori 1996) and the political controversy that surrounds ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
increasing significance in the public sphere, current research is justified to a cer-
tain extent in focusing on the subversive potential he represents. However, in the
constant juxtaposition of KhÁlid on the one hand and the religious establishment
and traditional Islamism on the other, there is a danger of confusing a conflict that
is socially determined with an ideologically determined one. In the approach to
Islamic thought, there is no ideological conflict between them, only degrees of

depth and involvement. Therefore, rather than creating visions of zero sum games
between different Islamist agents in the Islamic field, it might be fruitful to assume
that, objectively speaking, KhÁlid produces effects in the field that are not neces-
sarily detrimental to those who dislike him among the ulama and Islamists.
This hypothesis is inspired by Pierre Bourdieu’s map of the field of cultural
production in nineteenth-century France. Bourdieu shows how different authors
writing in different genres made up a complex web of both conflicting and com-
plementary literary activities (Bourdieu 1993: 29–74). In Bourdieu’s words,
The emergence of a group capable of ‘making an epoch’ by imposing a new,
advanced position is accompanied by a displacement of the structure of tem-
porally hierarchized positions opposed within a given field (...). Each author,
school or work which ‘makes its mark’ displaces the whole series of earlier
authors, schools or works.
(Ibid.: 60)
This statement about the field of cultural production seems apt also for the Islamic
field. ÝAmr KhÁlid is certainly in the process of ‘making his mark’ in the Islamic
field, thus altering the positions of other agents such as the ulama. This constitutes
a sociological conflict which we will look at from a linguistic point of view. At the
same time, although KhÁlid shares the fundamental religious attitudes of modern
ulama such as YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and the centrist Islamists, the ideological impact
of his presence on the scene is still uncertain, especially given his novel way of
approaching the notorious ‘other’ in Islamist culture. Both these questions will be
addressed below.
The nature and content of ‘Amr Khlid’s books
So far, I have described ÝAmr KhÁlid mainly in his capacity as a televangelist, and
this is also the approach taken by other scholars. The present analysis, however,
draws on written material – on his books. This choice necessitates some expla-
nation in addition to the comments already made in Chapter 2. KhÁlid’s books
are very different from those of the other authors in this study, in terms of their
production, content and style. Being no author, KhÁlid does not actually write
his books himself. According to Mirwat Anwar, an editor at the ArÐj publishing
house, which has published most of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s books, the content of his books
is never unique.5
Instead, his books and booklets are always based on a lecture or
a series of lectures or TV shows. He gives his notes or script to ArÐj, who provide
references to QurÞÁn quotations and hadiths and check that quotations are correct.
Then they get an official approval from al-Azhar that the references are correct.
This is important in order to avoid criticism of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s preaching. Lastly,
they translate the manuscript into fus
.h
. by employing a team of linguists. At the
end, KhÁlid approves the result with or without changes or rejects it.6
These facts might make one think that the books are irrelevant as a medium
for ÝAmr KhÁlid’s preaching, a mere by-product of his real televangelist activity.
82 Islamist rhetoric
That seems not to be the case, however. Although he is first and foremost an ora-
tor, using with great success pitch variations and graphic effects in his lectures,
his books are not just poor copies of his live performances. On the contrary, the
publisher asserts that they sell quite well, especially during the annual book fair in
Cairo and during religious holidays. In 2006, several of his books were into their
fourth round of printing in three years. They are easily available in upmarket dis-
tricts of Cairo, typically placed on a shelf near the exit of the popular Metro super-
markets. As for their content, it is clear that they are designed to be consumed (the
word is apt here) as independent products, and not spin-off products; for example,
ÝAmr KhÁlid often asks the reader to ‘read this passage once more, and reflect on
it’(e.g. KhÁlid 2003a: 8). This request would not make sense in any other medium
than a book. Accordingly, his books can be regarded as one among many means
to disseminate his message. In fact, in our context they become particularly inter-
esting, as they introduce a completely new, quasi-oral style into the Islamic book
market. The culture surrounding the production and consumption of these books,
as well as their style, makes them different from both the relatively high-brow
literature analysed elsewhere in this book and the folksy ‘Islamic book’, which is
sold in bookstalls on the streets of Cairo (Gonzalez-Quijano 1993: 413–423). The
new preachers represent a new rhetoric that may have an effect on the Islamic field
to a greater or lesser degree. In this capacity, KhÁlid’s written texts constitute an
interesting object of study.
KhÁlid has published a number of books and booklets. Even though there are
greatdifferencesinlength,scopeandsubjectmatterbetweenthem,thestyleofwrit-
ing does not differ much. Three books and three booklets form the source material
for the analysis below. Ysuf: ‘ibra wa-‘iz
.a (YÙsuf: a moral lesson) (KhÁlid 2003b)
is a practical exegesis (cf. Jansen 1980) of the sra ‘YÙsuf’.7
Although it must be
termed an exegesis on account of its glosses and interpretations of the QurÞÁnic
text, this should not be taken to mean that it is in any way a profound or incisive
work. Quite the contrary: the QurÞÁnic text is taken at face value, so to speak,
and there is neither discussion nor reference to anything other than the QurÞÁn to
be found, except for some quotations of well-known hadiths. KhÁlid reviews the
QurÞÁnic story about Joseph and makes commentaries along the way about Joseph
being an example for contemporary Muslims in terms both of his mentality and
of his behaviour. He goes through the story in detail and, after describing some
event in Joseph’s life, he puts himself and the reader in Joseph’s place to show
which hardships he had to endure and how psychologically difficult it must have
been. Then he connects Joseph’s experiences to contemporary life for Muslims.
For example, he retells the passage where the Pharaoh wants to have his dreams
interpreted for him and, since this proved to be Joseph’s escape from prison to a
new and luxurious life, KhÁlid uses this part of the story to prove that God helps us
in unexpected ways and by unexpected means, so we should relax and have faith
in Him. The book is meant as practical inspiration for a pious life and for comfort
and joy in the faith, as he writes in the Introduction (KhÁlid 2003b: 10).
Akhlq al-mu’min (The believer’s morals) (KhÁlid 2003a) is the same format
as Ysuf, with roughly the same layout and organization. However, it is not an
The rhetoric of religious passion 83
exegesis, but an exposition of seven virtues that KhÁlid considers central in Islam:
moral perfection (ih
.sn), modesty (tawd
.u‘), honesty (s
.idq), integrity (amna),
loyalty (waf’), a sense of honour and shame (h
.ay’), and compassion (rah
.ma).
Using examples from the QurÞÁn and the early history of Islam, it tackles the
issue of how to behave like a good Muslim in all areas of life: in the family, at the
workplace and towards your housemaids(!), friends and enemies. Similar to Ysuf,
it is clearly hortatory, more concerned to admonish than to discuss the issues at
hand or even present them in a thorough way. Also included is the book al-S
.abr
wa-l-dhawq (Patience and sensitivity) (KhÁlid 2004a), which is a continuation
of Akhlq al-mu’min, in exactly the same format and layout, and with the same
organization.
The booklets are pocket-sized texts ranging from thirty to ninety small pages.
Wah
.dat al-umma al-islmiyya (Unity of the Islamic nation) (KhÁlid 2003c) is a
quasi-political cry for Islamic unity, with examples from the early Muslim com-
munity and the achievements of a united Europe. al-T
.arq il al-janna (The way to
paradise) (KhÁlid 2005a) is a small book about the wonders of paradise and how to
get there. Ma‘n s
.in‘at al-h
.ay (The meaning of lifemaking) (KhÁlid 2004b) was
published as part of the KhÁlid-initiated ÑunnÁÝ al-ÎayÁ campaign and organiza-
tion, and it is about the religious duty to please God by working for a renaissance
(nahd
.a) for Arab and Islamic societies, along the lines of what happened in Japan
and Germany after the Second World War. Although the layouts of the books and
booklets differ to some extent, the language remains homogeneous across format
and layout differences.
Reference: being in it together
ÝAmr KhÁlid is very concerned with the thought of Islamic reform. However, the
kind of reform he proposes is not a theological one; he is not concerned about
centrism, westernization or ossification of Islamic thought, themes that are central
for YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ as well as for most Islamist writers. For KhÁlid, theoretical
considerations about how to interpret the holy texts are not a relevant issue. The
problem as he views it is that people do not live Islam. From Islamism KhÁlid
has received the idea that the improvement of Egyptian society (and indeed all
Muslim societies) is contingent on devotion to Islam. But he is not a political
preacher, and his reform is centred on individuals, since change starts from within,
as the title of one of his video-recorded lectures states (KhÁlid, no date). This fact
is reflected in his use of personal reference. KhÁlid explicitly states his wish to
create an atmosphere of dialogue:

Infactallhistextsarestructuredtoagreaterorlesserdegreeassimulationsofdialogue.
It is not surprising, then, that references to himself and his readers play an important
part in his texts, as these excerpts from Akhlq al-mu’min (KhÁlid 2003a) show:
You are charged with striving for perfection in all things, small and big...
Anything you can imagine – you are required to strive for perfection in it.
(p. 38)
I feel now that you have become light-hearted and ambitious!!

So I speak to you youths words from my heart: Consider her family, her
mother and father ... Consider her religiosity and morals ... Then look at the
other things ... You marry a family and a set of moral values ... This is perfec-
tion in choosing a wife.

We cannot follow the example of our lord Jesus, for instance. You can be
guided by him when you are a young bachelor, an ascetic in the world, striv-
ing on his own... But can you follow his example as a married man? No,
because he did not marry.

The rhetoric of religious passion 85
These examples illustrate that the most frequent references in his texts are: to him-
self in the singular, to the reader in the second person masculine singular (some-
times also in the second person masculine plural), and to an inclusive ‘we’. The
frequency and degree of switching between these references in his texts are far
greater than in any other Islamic text I read during the work on this book.
What immediately becomes clear when reading the examples is that KhÁlid’s
use of reference is highly unconventional for Arabic written discourse, includ-
ing the genre of hortatory and explicative religious guidance literature of which
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is one important exponent. Personal reference is arguably the
main axis around which KhÁlid constructs the interpersonal meanings of his texts.
Accordingly, the personal references are intertwined with the mood structures and
the ideational aspects of his discourse, as we will see later.
KhÁlid explicitly refers to himself as one part in a conversation to such a degree
that he is constantly present in the text.This is also true of the reader, who is referred
to directly both in terms of pronouns and as the subject of clauses. Furthermore, by
commenting on what goes on between reader and writer explicitly (‘I feel now that
you have become light-hearted and ambitious’), he transfers the live interaction of
his lectures and talk shows into the process of book reading, making himself and
the reader participants in the text.
Finally, the examples suggest that KhÁlid exploits referential switch to a con-
siderable degree. The following example from al-T
.arq il al-janna brings out this
feature particularly well:
God the blessed and sublime introduces new pleasures in paradise that are dif-
ferent from the ones in the world we know (...). What is this – it’s something

new you don’t know from your world and which God made for you, millions
of new pleasures which we don’t know yet, except for one. Yes, I know one
of them, and that is the vision of God the mighty and exalted. Even this one
we do not know fully, for we have not seen God, the mighty and sublime.
The Prophet, peace be upon him, says about this pleasure: ‘They will not
be given’ – that is, in paradise – ‘anything that is dearer to them than the
vision of their Lord, mighty and exalted.’ [Narrated by Muslim]... You will
also find other pleasures which you know from before.And, despite this, what
is it in this world that draws you to it and occupies you?! Am I busy with my
love for some girl, meeting her and dating her, not being able to leave her?!...
And you, what is your problem in this world? He says: ‘I pray, but then I stop
praying’– why? Have you forgotten about paradise? He says: ‘I don’t manage
to repent – I heard the lecture on repentance, but I’m not able to do it’ – why?
Because I do not know how to rely on God... Doesn’t your yearning for para-
dise push you towards repentance?
(KhÁlid 2005a: 63–64, emphases in original)
In this paragraph, he alternates between ‘we’, ‘you’ singular, ‘I’ and ‘he’ in rapid
succession. The very high number of pronominal references is better brought out
in a table. I have counted only those pronouns that occur as subjects of clauses
(see Table 5.1).
In addition to these references, there are several other pronouns in the second
person singular that are not subjects of clauses. All in all, the number of times the
reader and writer are referred to here and how often ÝAmr KhÁlid switches are
quite breathtaking. On top of that, the references to the third person singular can be
seen as a politeness strategy, since the message of these clauses is clearly aimed at
the reader. However, it seems that, because they imply some mild criticism of the
reader, the overt reference to him/her is discarded in favour of an anonymous third
person. Tellingly, these features of his texts – the direct references to himself and
the reader and the referential switches – correspond very well with Thompson and

The rhetoric of religious passion 87
Thetela’s description of the language of advertising in English, which is very con-
cerned about creating intimacy with the reader: ‘Advertisements very frequently
employ direct reference to the two participants in the interaction’ (Thompson and
Thetela 1995: 23). Accordingly, the many references to the writer and the reader
may be interpreted as a textual trace of the global market ideology that in Haenni’s
opinion pervades KhÁlid’s preaching (2005).
What is more, it also shows the degree to which ÝAmr KhÁlid appeals to feelings
and personal relations. The direct address to the reader, coupled with verbs such
as ‘I tell you...’ and ‘I feel that you...’, invites intimacy between writer and reader.
More than that, the quick and rapid change of reference, often associated with the
same verbal process (‘to know’ here), blurs the distinctions between the different
participants in the clauses and makes them all part of a big ‘we’. This corresponds
to the frequent descriptions of KhÁlid as a ‘big brother’ who sympathizes with his
followers, in contrast to the traditional religious shaykh who admonishes people
from his pulpit high above their heads. At times, for example, KhÁlid will tell the
reader about his thoughts and visions in a very personal way, as in the follow-
ing passage about what paradise will be like (which, incidentally, also exposes
KhÁlid’s well-known passion for football):
What do you [sing.] wish for? I wish that my palace will be filled with swim-
ming pools and football fields, and all my friends are there... We swim first,
and then we play football. I don’t speak nonsense here. I try to convey the
sense [of paradise] to you [pl.]..
(KhÁlid 2005a: 68)
Personal interventions like this one invite the readers to identify and sympathize
with the author.
The alternation between the references to the reader in the singular and the plu-
ral should also be accounted for. What is its effect? In most written discourse, the
use of the plural to address the readers is very rare. The exceptions are texts that
are meant to be read aloud before an audience, such as song lyrics and speeches.
ÝAmr KhÁlid’s books, however, are just that – books, which are presumably meant
for silent reading – and the dominant reference to the reader is in the second per-
son singular form. Still, from time to time he inserts the plural instead, as in these
examples. The first is a heading which introduces a hadith:
Now here you [pl.] have this, you who love the Prophet, peace be upon him.

Dream [pl.] of Paradise and, when you [sing.] sleep at night, imagine what
you want it to be like.
(KhÁlid 2005a: 67–68)
In the second example, we see that, not only does he address both a single person
and several persons, he does so within the same sentence. Sometimes he really
takes off, as here:
Have you [pl.] understood the greatness of religion? For, when you [sing.]
die, all kinds of benefits pour down on you. Do we not remember the
hadith (...)
(KhÁlid 2005a: 85)
In this example there are references to a single reader, a group of readers and the
writer and reader(s) together, all within one short line of text. What effect does
this diversified way of relating to the reader(s) have? A reasonable interpreta-
tion is that it is a good way of combining an appeal to individuals and a creation
of group identity. Existing research raises the point that, as a product of post-
modern globalization, the new Islamic preaching is more focused on individu-
als and individualism than traditional preaching. This view should probably be
qualified somewhat, at least if we are to take KhÁlid as a leading proponent of the
new Islamic preaching. An excursion into his other activities is useful here.
First, several of his TV shows are set in a small studio with a limited number
of participants, who are all active supporters of him. This often gives a kind
of family feeling to the shows. Second, in recent years an important part of his
programme has been social welfare work carried out by local committees in
various cities inside and outside the Arab world. Through both TV shows and
the magazine S
.unn‘ al-h
.ay, these groups are praised for their initiatives and
share their experiences with one another. As a result, active supporters of ÝAmr
KhÁlid belong to something that is bigger than themselves, a collective effort
that is the result of individual awakening. When he at times chooses to address
a crowd instead of just the individual reader, it contributes to the idea of him
and all his readers ‘being in it together’. Another point which also has got to do
with group feeling is that the scattered references to a group of readers facilitate
reading aloud to each other, for example in private religious study circles. In
this way KhÁlid, intentionally or unintentionally, encourages interaction not only
between the readers and himself, but among the readers, too. Finally, the shifts
between singular and plural reference may also be seen as part of the simulation
of a live setting that is so characteristic of KhÁlid’s texts. The references to the

readers in the plural evoke the picture of KhÁlid in a lecture hall addressing an
audience.
On the whole, then, the combination of references to the reader, KhÁlid himself
and both together with the inclusive ‘we’ creates a feeling of intimacy in his texts
and evokes feelings of mutual sympathy between him and his readers. In this way,
his pronominal references contribute to his ethos as a spiritual coach and friend
instead of a teacher.At the same time, they evoke feelings of sympathy and friend-
ship, constructing a distinct pathos that is found in all his texts.
Making piety easy
Recalling the analysis of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s mood structures, we saw that he
adopts a measured, impersonal style with few exclamations, imperatives and
questions. Instead, he offers information in the form of declarative sentences.
This is definitely not the case with ÝAmr KhÁlid. He will readily give his readers
commands, and often challenges them directly by posing questions to them. Both
modes are represented in the following example, from a section in al-T
.arq il al-
janna about the need to know what one wants in life:
You [sing.] – what is your goal and what do you want? Define your goal
– what do you want, my brothers! Do you [pl.] want God? Well, the road to
Him is clear, and you don’t need any long lectures. You need a reminder from
time to time and to connect [sing.] to God’s path... But define your [sing.]
goal, for if you don’t know what you want you will be lost in the world and
die without knowing what it is you want, and you’ll be standing on the Day
of Resurrection not knowing where you are or whom to go to... Define your
goal.
(KhÁlid 2005a: 42–43)
In this short paragraph, there are four questions to the reader(s), of which one may
be said to be rhetorical (‘Do you want God?’). There are three identical impera-
tive clauses. The bombardment of demands is a characteristic feature of all of
ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts, and, while interrogatives are the most prominent mood here,

found in the writings of either MuÎammad ÝImÁra or YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, and
indeed not in the field of religious literature generally.
Clearly, then, the relations of intimacy and solidarity that are built up through
the use of first and second person pronouns do not mean that ÝAmr KhÁlid does not
put pressure on the reader. On the contrary, his texts are full of demands. This is
only natural when seen in connection with the content of his texts, which is often
about changing practices to make them conform to ‘true’ Islam. One of the two
main components of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s religious message is a very pronounced social
conservatism, which is apparent in his discourse about popular culture and gender
roles and relations. For example, he has criticized sharply the infamous ‘video
clip’, an omnipresent part of contemporary Egyptian public space. In cafés, on
TV channels and in fast food outlets, there is a steady stream of music videos in
which relatively scantily clad young girls dance or just walk about in more or less
suggestive ways. ÝAmr KhÁlid holds that the video clip is a foreign practice that
is ‘driving society toward flaccidity and collapse’ (KhÁlid 2005b). As for gender
roles, it is telling that one of the few passages in the book where he refers explicitly
to the second person singular feminine is a section on household chores and the
raising of children as an Islamic virtue (KhÁlid 2003a: 52). The passage is directed
exclusively at women, which shows ÝAmr KhÁlid to be socially conservative in
relation to current Egyptian standards among the middle classes. Elsewhere, he
has warned of the immorality of standing idly by the Xerox machine at work while
chatting with a colleague of the opposite sex. The other main component of his
discourse is a social activism which demands personal sacrifices from his follow-
ers, mostly in the form of lost leisure time.
The upshot of his use of interrogatives and imperatives is that, much more
than the other writers in this study, KhÁlid pressures his readers to react to his
words. In keeping with his concept of reform as personal action more than a
collective intellectual endeavour, his focus is on quick reflection and practice.
Hence the questions to the reader, which challenge him/her to give an immediate
answer, and the imperatives, which demand some kind of action on the part of
the reader. KhÁlid’s mood choices give his texts a distinct sense of urgency and
immediacy.
At the same time, however, the endless chains of questions and commands put
him at risk of damaging the intimate relationship with the readers. Why? As in the
area of reference, ÝAmr KhÁlid’s mood structures seem on the face of it to simulate
the language of advertising. Thompson and Thetela (1995) note that interroga-
tives and imperatives are among the prime linguistic tools for advertisers when
trying to influence the reader. However, the relations that obtain between writer
and reader at the outset enter the picture here. While advertisers aim at getting
people to buy something, thus being in an inferior position, KhÁlid is a preacher
whose books people read because they want advice on how to live their lives. As
KhÁlid is an adviser, the relationship of power is unequal the other way around:
it is the reader who is in an inferior position. Suzanne Eggins argues that by the
extensive use of imperatives in advisory texts the writer runs the risk of creating
‘boundaries, rather than solidarity, between writer and reader’(Eggins 1994: 114).
The rhetoric of religious passion 91
At the same time, considering his social conservatism, one would think that a
discourse which aggressively reiterates demands for a pious life with personal sac-
rifices on page after page would not enjoy the immense popularity among youths
that ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts do.
One explanation for this apparent paradox is his ability to speak in a contempo-
rary, cool style filled with an attractive imagery, asWÁÞil LuÔfÐ (2005) and Lindsay
Wise (2003) have shown. However, the textual analysis of his personal references
suggests an additional explanation that has got to do with the interplay between
mood structures and reference. The question is how he manages to retain the inti-
macy and solidarity with the reader despite all the demands he directs at him/her.
Eggins suggests that modalization is a way of attenuating commands to preserve
a bond of intimacy with the reader, but ÝAmr KhÁlid’s imperatives are as direct
and unmodalized as can be. Instead, it seems that his extensive use of direct
reference to himself and his readers enters the picture again. He uses these
references not only to produce a feeling of intimacy, but also to create a scale of
distance and closeness between himself, the reader and third persons he refers to
in his texts (cf. Wilson 1990: 58). The result is a sense of community and soli-
darity among himself and the readers vis-à-vis a grey mass of careless or igno-
rant Muslims. At the far end of KhÁlid’s scale are the undefined third persons,
who are either viewed neutrally or identified with something that KhÁlid disap-
proves of. These are sometimes referred to collectively, as ‘kathÐr min al-nÁs’
(many people) or ‘baÝÃ al-nÁs’(some people). At other times, KhÁlid exemplifies
with a generic character, such as the unreasonable housewife or the young man
who acts in an arrogant way, and subsequently refers to this character as ‘she’
or ‘he’.
There are many people who have a very fragmented understanding of Islam,
even if they are religiously minded.
(KhÁlid 2004b: 26)
Some people have a poor understanding of things and say: won’t we get dis-
satisfied in paradise?
(KhÁlid 2005a: 62)
Some women do not allow their maid to make even one mistake without
working themselves up and screaming in her face.
(KhÁlid 2003a: 76)

92 Islamist rhetoric
Recalling the analysis of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s use of pronouns, we can see that
ÝAmr KhÁlid makes use of the same distinction between the grey mass of the ‘oth-
ers’ and a select group of insiders. However, whereas al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s reference
creates a picture of himself alone on the top, KhÁlid construes himself as being on
the same level as the reader.
Let us continue outlining the pronominal distance scale. At a lesser distance
than the undefined third persons come the defined third persons, who are gener-
ally cited as good examples of praiseworthy behaviour, whether he writes about
the prophet MuÎammad and his companions or great scientists like Thomas A.
Edison. KhÁlid tells the reader to emulate these great men and women, and thus
creates a bond of identification which draws these third persons closer to the cir-
cle of writer and reader. For example, nearly half the booklet Ma‘n s
.in‘at al-
h
.ay (KhÁlid 2004b) is devoted to describing the achievements of such a diverse
array of persons as the daughter of the caliph AbÙ Bakr, Ibn SÐnÁ, Ibn Khaldun,
the Wright brothers, the already mentioned Thomas A. Edison and the Egyptian
Nobel laureate AÎmad Zuwayl, in addition to the prophet MuÎammad himself, of
course.
However, they too are at a distance, because everything that really matters in
ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts is centred round the reader and KhÁlid himself as a spiritual
guide and friend. The pervasive references to ‘I’, ‘we’and ‘you’which I pointed to
above create an intimate relationship between ÝAmr KhÁlid and his reader and put
them both at a safe distance from the grey mass of people who sin or are indiffer-
ent to the Islamic message. In this way, KhÁlid’s moral demands to the reader are
attenuated by being uttered in an atmosphere of friendship and shared experience.
The intimate relationship between the reader and KhÁlid rather makes the moral
demands look like exciting, even joyful tasks:
Imagine [sing. fem.]... The more you care about your house, the more virtu-
ous you appear to God. So, after today, will we ever see the house untidy
again, or sheets of paper lying around here and there? And, after today, will
we ever see... No, as of today, you have become a perfectionist.
(KhÁlid 2003a: 52)
At other times, emphasizing the feeling of ‘being in it together’, ÝAmr KhÁlid
refers to himself instead of his reader when the latter is obviously the intended
addressee:

The rhetoric of religious passion 93
Why do I sit with crossed arms, awaiting some task?! Why don’t I think and
seek God for help?! Why do I consider myself less able than those who have
succeeded in East or West?!
(KhÁlid 2005a: 6)
The last example of how KhÁlid uses reference to attenuate his moral demands is
a bit clumsy and therefore rather revealing. It shows his wish to make an impact as
strong as possible on the reader by addressing him/her directly, while at the same
time he wants to retain the sense of common ground between them:
Aren’t you ashamed before God? For he perfected his creation of the world...
Of you... And he perfected the book which was sent down to you. And, in
spite of that, you do not strive towards perfection... You say: I shall strive for
perfection, if God wills?
I do not mean you, my dear [reader]... I mean those who do not strive for
perfection!!
(KhÁlid 2003a: 42)
Here, KhÁlid could have chosen to write about third persons: some people, they,
etc. But he does not, and the likely reason is a wish to impress upon the reader how
obvious and important is the religious duty of perfection (’ih
.sn). On the whole,
however, he avoids confrontational expressions like this, and, as we have seen,
instead casts his demands in a light-hearted language.
Although reference is the most important tool in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s linguistic reper-
toire,healsousesothermeans,notablytense,toattenuatehisdemands.Considerthe

94 Islamist rhetoric
God, the exalted, says:
Tell My bondmen to speak that which is kindlier (The Night Journey, v.
53).
God be praised!! You choose the sweetest and best words...
I feel now that you have become light-hearted and ambitious!! You respond
to the verses [of the QurÞÁn] with ease... You used to say to your mother when
you left the house: ‘What do you want!’ But now, you will search for the
sweetest and best words (that which is kindlier).
God be praised!!... What is changed is the tone of your voice and the sweet
word, what is changed is that you have perfected [your behaviour].
(KhÁlid 2003a: 48)
The imperative sense of this statement, easily felt by the reader, is embedded in the
perfect and imperfect aspects of the verbs. The reader used to speak rashly to his
parents, but now he will begin to find sweeter words to say to them. His tone has
changed – he has perfected his speech. With the exclamation ‘subÎÁn allÁh!!’(God
be praised) ÝAmr KhÁlid congratulates the reader on changing his ways, which
has taken place simply by reading the two paragraphs. There is no need to tell
the reader what to do. The verse from the QurÞÁn is enough to inspire change, and
KhÁlid needs only to cheer his reader along. The underlying message seems to be
that it is so easy to improve oneself; it is just a matter of mentality and awareness.
This way of inciting the reader to change for the better is widespread in Akhlq al-
mu’min, the whole of which is focused on how to live life as a good Muslim.
This celebration of a personal change that has in reality not taken place yet is
symptomatic of the general liveliness and positivity that permeate KhÁlid’s writ-
ings. In addition, I would argue that the great distance between KhÁlid/the reader
and the undefined third persons he uses as examples to show what is wrong in
society also contributes to the overall positive atmosphere. By standing together
with the reader and pointing at ‘those other people’ who sin or behave badly, he
reassures the reader about his/her moral integrity at the same time as he makes
him/her more aware of religious morals. The reader feels that s/he is already set
apart from the grey, indifferent masses and belongs to a different sphere where s/
he is surrounded by a religious conscience and will to improve. Consequently, the
modesty, separation of the sexes, self-discipline and meaningful usage of leisure
time that KhÁlid demands from his followers seem easier to accomplish. This is
the masterstroke of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s intensely personal language.
The marked tendency in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse to elaborate on possibilities
and the potential for change instead of using space on criticism of the current
state of affairs, on both a personal and a societal level, correlates with his positive
language. The absence of an active ‘other’, since his ‘other’ is there merely to
underline the intimacy and solidarity between him and his readers, also contrib-
utes to the positive atmosphere. The fact that he does not posit an active and threat-
ening ‘other’ provides yet another contrast between his texts and those of YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ and to an even greater extent MuÎammad ÝImÁra. In this picture, the
will to take some political risks in order to initiate a dialogue with non-Muslim
The rhetoric of religious passion 95
Europeans, as KhÁlid did in Denmark during the cartoon crisis in 2006, fits in
nicely. We will return to this point in Chapter 7.
Mood and style: the primacy of feeling
Interestingly, the imperatives and strong sense of urgency that permeate KhÁlid’s
texts are seldom accompanied by any dramatic message. In other words, these
imperatives have no real content, but are a linguistic means of intensifying the
communication with the reader. Thus, one heading simply reads ‘taÞammal wa-
tadabbar!!’ (observe and ponder) (KhÁlid 2003c: 30), while another one tells the
reader ‘intabah li-hÁdhÁ...’(take note of this) (KhÁlid 2004b: 36). After such head-
ings, ÝAmr KhÁlid will present some edifying story or an example that drives home
one of his points.As for those imperatives that bear content, what is it that he wants
his readers to do? Typical exhortations include determining a goal in life, lifting
each other’s spirits and hopes, and being sincere towards God. His readers are not
to despair or quarrel among themselves. As for concrete actions, he tells them to
treat their relatives well (KhÁlid 2003b: 224), or to make sure they fill their spare
time with meaningful activities (KhÁlid 2003b: 124). KhÁlid tends to demand the
obvious of his readers and, spiritually speaking, his texts are not imaginative.
There is no denying that ÝAmr KhÁlid has really made efforts to improve the
situation of Arabs both in Arab countries and in Europe, and that he has inspired
many others to try to do the same. Nevertheless, the religious message in his writ-
ings is rather bland. Its strength lies in the intense way of communicating with
the reader all along. In that sense, the fact that the imperatives are imperatives
is more important than what specific command they convey to the reader. By
his direct address, questions and commands to the reader, KhÁlid forces him/her
to react to his propositions all the time, all through the book. Together with the
many exclamations that dot his texts, the imperatives and interrogatives can draw
a receptive reader into the same intensive mood that characterizes ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
texts, despite the fact that their content is less than exciting.
ThismightpartlyexplainthemisgivingsthatprominentEgyptianpoliticalanalysts
have regarding KhÁlid as a ‘political’ figure (Wise 2003: 86–87), or as a useful tool
for the Muslim Brotherhood’s political project of realizing an Islamic state, despite
his careful avoidance of national political issues in his discourse.8
In this regard it
is interesting to note that KhÁlid’s demands for concrete action disappear when the
issue at stake is overtly political. While his books and booklets about personal edifi-
cation are full of concrete demands, the few texts where he treats issues that can be
seen as even vaguely political exhibit a conspicuous lack of demands, and instead he
reverts to general phrases. Thus, in Wah
.dat al-umma al-islmiyya (KhÁlid 2003c),
which calls for unity and solidarity between Islamic societies, the only imperatives to
be found are the intensifying ones (‘look!’, ‘ponder this!’). Such rhetorical variation
suggests that KhÁlid is sensitive to the effect of his rhetoric and tries not to construe
himself as a political figure. His preaching is a balancing act of trying to incite people
to action while staying out of politics, a difficult combination in a country where the
authorities are extremely wary of social activism of any kind.
96 Islamist rhetoric
I have suggested that speaking in terms of religious thought ÝAmr KhÁlid’s dis-
course is neither original nor exciting. Instead, the intimate quality of his texts
allows KhÁlid greater freedom to express feelings than argumentative prose
would. In fact, arousing feelings seems to be an end in itself. During his shows,
it is not uncommon that either his guests or he himself break into tears, and in his
public sermons he often talks with a trembling voice and high pitch. Since writing
does not offer these possibilities of conveying feelings, it is all the more note-
worthy that ÝAmr KhÁlid’s written texts impress upon the reader a strong sense of
emotional intensity. By what means does he achieve this effect? Obviously, the
emphasis on personal relations between writer and reader which we discussed
above is an important factor. So is word choice; KhÁlid frequently employs words
like ‘love’ and ‘heart’, which are associated with strong feelings. This vocabulary
echoes his talk shows, which are characterized by personal, emotional stories. The
title of one of them, ‘KalÁm min al-qalb’ (Words from the heart), testifies to this
quality.9
But there are other means of connecting to people’s feelings, means that are
more subtle than words and choice of subject matter, but not less efficient for
that reason. One feature that stands out in this respect in KhÁlid’s text has to do
with mood. In expository prose, the dominant mood is usually declarative, with
a good deal of interrogatives scattered throughout the text as either open or rhe-
torical questions. In ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts, however, there are many vocatives and
interjections (in addition to the imperatives we have already discussed). The direct
address to the reader is a key element that supports the widespread use of second
person reference which I analysed above. Vocatives like ‘yÁ ÁkhÐ l-ÎabÐb!’ (my
dear brother), ‘ÁkhÐ!’ (my brother) and ‘ikhwatÐ!’ (my brothers) are often found in
his texts, and are sometimes made to function as headings of sorts, as in the fol-
lowing example, where the original has ‘ÁkhÐ’ in large, bold type within a circle,
while the rest of the text is in small, regular type:
My brother!!
There is something greater than living for myself and my children: that I
live for my religion and nation.
(KhÁlid 2003c: 26)
Regular exclamations are an important part of his texts, and also serve to focus
on feelings – feelings of awe, inspiration and wonder. After an example of how
pleasantly the prophet MuÎammad behaved towards other people, for example, he
writes ‘yÁ l-lÁh... ayna naÎnu min hÁdhihi l-ÒifÁt’ (Oh, God... where are we with
regard to these characteristics) (KhÁlid 2003a: 64). Another favourite expression
is ‘subÎÁn allÁh’, which we have already encountered. Below is another example
of how it is used together with relatively trivial statements. KhÁlid contrasts the

two words khajal and h
.ay’ (which both denote shame), arguing that the first
denotes shame in a negative sense, as stemming from fear and cowardice, whereas
the latter term is connected to religion and knowing one’s true value and, conse-
quently, how one should and should not behave:
God be praised!! We used to believe that al-h
.ay’ and al-khajal are syno-
nyms, and know we see clearly that they are in fact opposites.
(KhÁlid 2003a: 178)
Finally, exclamations not involving God are also very common, such as ‘Îaqqan
innahu iÎsÁsun rÁÞiÝ!’ (it is truly a great feeling) (KhÁlid 2003c: 29) or ‘mÁ ajmal
min hÁdhihi l-ÞÁyÁt!!’ (what could be more beautiful than these verses) (KhÁlid
2003b: 156). Now why are all these vocatives and exclamations there, and what is
their effect? The two questions are connected to each other. Vocatives and excla-
mations do not contribute to the message as such in any way, except – and this
is just the point – if the message itself is more about form than content. As I
have already stated, the subjects that ÝAmr KhÁlid treats in his books and lectures
are often rather trivial. In addition to his calls for practical, philanthropic work,
KhÁlid’s message is that you should be nice to people, that paradise is a wonder-
ful place, that there are difficulties in life that religious devotion can help you
overcome, and so on. These propositions are neither new nor a matter for discus-
sion. It seems that KhÁlid’s aim is to make the words come alive for his audience
more than to make a statement. In this scheme, his strategy of telling and show-
ing instead of presenting an argument is effective. And, in order to tell his stories
more loudly and show his points more clearly, he resorts not only to words that are
associated with feelings. In addition, he clothes his words in mood structures – the
interjection and vocative – that boost his emotional commitment to them, and so it
is the intensity of feeling that is to persuade the reader about his message instead
of arguments in favour of it. In this way, form takes priority over content, and the
form gives the impression of a religiosity that is centred on feelings instead of a
distinct religious message.
The grammar of encouraging personal responsibility
What are the important participants and processes in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts, and
how are they construed? Let us begin with the question of participants. Consider
the following example. It is taken from the book al-S
.abr wa-l-dhawq (Patience
and sensitivity) (KhÁlid 2004a), which is not about these two virtues per se,
but rather about how the reader should implement them in his/her daily life
to become a better Muslim. This is how ÝAmr KhÁlid introduces the virtue of
dhawq:

Now the virtue which we will turn to presently, it has become difficult for you
to be convinced that it is an Islamic virtue!! In fact, you would be amazed if
this was said.
The virtue of altruism, for example – you’re sure that it is an Islamic virtue,
even if you don’t know what it means... But [with] the virtue of sensitivity it
is the opposite.
For you know it well and shape your behaviour according to it, but you
don’t know that it’s an Islamic virtue, and, therefore, when I say to you ‘the
virtue of sensitivity... manners... high-mindedness... having high standards in
your dealings with people...’
I find you saying: ‘And what is the connection between this and Islam?’
Many of us feel that this virtue is alien to Islam...!!
And, therefore, we want our fundamental plan to be that you arrive with me
at the conclusion that sensitivity is a genuinely Islamic virtue.
(KhÁlid 2004a: 87)
In this extract, there is no doubt that everything that goes on hinges on ‘you’,
‘me’ and ‘we’. They are the subjects of fourteen out of twenty-three clauses,
mostly main clauses. Even the actual definition of the term al-dhawq is not just
represented by a relational process where it is the Carrier, such as ‘al-dhawq is/
means...’ Instead, ÝAmr KhÁlid is construed as the Speaker, as the one who means
something by using the term dhawq. And after the definition, which is no more
than a long list of synonyms, the attention again turns to KhÁlid and the reader,
and their experience when pondering the term. The term al-dhawq is actually not
the subject of a single sentence in this passage, which is taken from the beginning
of the section about sensitivity. The proportion of personal pronouns as subjects
relative to other entities of course varies throughout the texts, but this passage is

The rhetoric of religious passion 99
nonetheless representative of the prominence of personal pronouns as Actors in
ÝAmr KhÁlid’s books.
Considering the massive presence of references to the writer and the reader in
KhÁlid’s texts, which was examined earlier in this chapter, it is not surprising that
the ideational content in his texts revolves around these two entities. Even though
none of the books analysed here include people in their titles, it is people, first and
foremost KhÁlid and the reader, that they are about.
As Thompson and Thetela (1995) state, when roles are projected on the writer
and reader in this way, the interpersonal component of discourse overlaps with the
ideational: ‘[T]he person on whom the role is projected is simultaneously a par-
ticipant in the language event and a participant in the clause.’Consequently, when
‘I’, ‘we’ and ‘you’ are projected into roles as often as they are in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
texts, it necessarily entails that the discourse acquires a very personal flavour.
Accordingly, there are relatively few passives and verbal nouns in his texts, and
entities such as concepts and institutions have almost no role whatsoever. In this
regard, his texts are very different from YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s, which are centred
around concepts like Islam, Islamic discourse, ijtihd and the West, all construed
as active forces in the world.
Now what relationships do the agents of KhÁlid’s texts enter into, what kind of
processes are dominant, how are they realized grammatically, and what can this
tell us about the form of Islam he shapes through his language? To answer this, it
is useful to conduct a detailed transitivity analysis of two passages, one from al-
T

100 Islamist rhetoric
How do we recognize whether the whispering comes from Satan or our
soul? [We must know this] in order to deal with each of them in the proper
way..
Satan whispers to encourage you to commit a sin at first. Then if you resist
him or turn him down he will leave you instantly, moving along to suggesting
another. For he does not want you to commit any sin in particular, but rather
that you sin in any kind of way (...).
As for the soul, it is different. It insists on whispering about one sin in par-
ticular, so, if you find your soul being insistent, don’t think it is Satan – it’s
your soul. For the soul yearns for a specific kind of sin and insists on it. It
does not prepare it itself in the beginning, for in the beginning Satan whispers
about it. Then you commit it once, and the soul takes a liking to it and seizes
on it, and then it starts insisting (...).
So Satan begins – and therefore he is dangerous, for he opens before
you a hundred ways of committing sins. But the soul chooses one and clings
to it like a child, so you resist it like the father who does not let his son
attach himself to something that harms him, so that he becomes an upright
person.
(KhÁlid 2005a: 17–18)
What does h
.ay’ mean?
We hear sometimes that someone is h
.ayiyy or has got h
.ay’, and what
do we mean by that?... al-h
.ay’ means self-restraint, i.e. that the soul cannot
do or stand anything low or ugly, for the modest [h
.ayiyy] person does not
bear to see his soul insulted before God, before other people or before
himself.

The rhetoric of religious passion 103
The analyses of Akhlq al-mu’min (p. 176) look like this:
Let us start with the first question: what kind of process is dominant? In these
passages, activity in a very literal sense is at the forefront. The agents engage in
activity all the time: thinking (mental processes), talking (verbal processes) and
doing things (material processes). There is little focus on definitions or assertions
about what and how things are (relational processes). As for the participants in
the action, they are single, clearly defined entities that are easily grasped (‘you’
and ‘we’, the ‘soul’ and Satan). As usual, the reader is at the forefront, supported
by ÝAmr KhÁlid, who is included in the ‘we’ at the beginning; the latter pronoun
contributes to creating the atmosphere of solidarity and understanding I have noted
above. The two other active participants, Satan and the soul, appear elsewhere
in KhÁlid’s texts as well (e.g. KhÁlid 2003b: 76, 184), and the interplay between
the reader and these two agents merits some comments. The division between a
person and his/her soul comes from the QurÞÁn, which depicts the soul as prone
to evil, and Satan as whispering to humans to make them commit sins (QurÞÁn 7:
20 and 50: 16). What is interesting to note is that, in this passage, neither the soul
nor Satan is depicted as actually performing any tangible action, except in a meta-
phoric sense, for example when Satan ‘leaves’ the reader and ‘moves’ to another
sin he wants the reader to commit, and when the soul ‘clings to’ a sin. It is the
reader, ‘you’, who must take responsibility for carrying out the sinful acts in the
physical world: ‘Then you committed it once...’

104 Islamist rhetoric
This constellation of participants – the individual reader, his/her soul and Satan
– is symptomatic of a general characteristic of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts, namely their
focus on personal spirituality. Unlike what is depicted in much other Islamist dis-
course, such as that of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and MuÎammad ÝImÁra, ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
universe is not inhabited by Western secular power, corrupt, ungodlyArab regimes
and ‘tendencies’ (the term tayyrt is a favourite with Islamist writers) that pro-
mote this or that ideology. In contrast to traditional Islamism, the struggle for Islam
is not fought primarily against structural enemies such as cultural imperialism or
the inadequate reliance on Islamic jurisprudence in the legal system. For KhÁlid,
it is the inner world that counts, the world of personal spirituality. Accordingly, he
focuses on the powers that vie for domination within the individual Muslim: the
conscious will, the unruly soul and a never-resting Satan.
As for the grammatical realization of the processes in the texts, it contributes to
creating a reality where the reader’s responsibility for what is going on is empha-
sized. When reading KhÁlid’s texts in comparison with those of more traditional
Islamic preachers such as YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, one is immediately struck by his
limited use of the verbal noun (mas
.dar) and the passive voice, which both offer
the possibility of obscuring agency. The use of the verbal noun is usually very
common in Modern Written Arabic, but the excerpts I have analysed here are typi-
cal of KhÁlid’s texts in that there are very few of them. Tellingly, in the second
quote, which starts with a definition built on an agentless verbal noun (inqibd
.
al-nafs, self-restraint), the definition is at once explained by a sentence where
‘al-nafs’ is the Actor. In general, when verbal nouns are found, they are often very
verbal in their sense and closely connected to an agent. In the first quote above,
for example, the verbal nouns ilh
.h
. and is
.rr are realized as such only because the
syntactic structure in the sentence requires it, since the verb qma is used to cre-
ate a complex verbal phrase (cf. the English translation: the self starts insisting...).
Here and elsewhere, processes are normally expressed by finite verbs in the active
voice. A consequence of this is that KhÁlid’s texts are full of explicitly attrib-
uted agency. Thus, his texts display less variation in construing processes than
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s, while at the same time emphasiz-
ing the active role of the reader in the processes he writes about. With his focus on
personal spirituality and the presentation of the reader as responsible for actions,
ÝAmr KhÁlid creates a picture of Islam that is centred on the reader as an active and
responsible individual.
Conclusion
ÝAmr KhÁlid and YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ are both engaged in proselytizing first and
foremost, but they clearly approach this task in almost diametrically opposed
ways. al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s smooth prose, with its measured tone and refined style, is
contrasted by KhÁlid’s staccato language and emotional outbursts. They also rely
on very different ways of relating to their readers. While al-QaraÃÁwÐ constructs
an ethos centred on authority and guidance for the whole Muslim community,
KhÁlid acts as the reader’s friend and mentor and disregards other factors than the
The rhetoric of religious passion 105
personal ones in his call to Islamic reform. The focus on individual change and
religious devotion, together with the fact that his written discourse is influenced
by his oral style of preaching, makes his use of pronominal reference unique in
the field of Islamic literature. He is extremely concerned with the relationship
between himself as writer and the reader.
Do these differences mean that there is a conflict between the culture of the new
preachers and more traditional Islamist preaching? This is an interesting question
that I will return to in Chapter 7.
What is at any rate abundantly clear when one observes middle-class Cairene
culture is that the new preaching is no passing whim and that, with ÝAmr KhÁlid,
it has consolidated its hold on the religious imagination for large sections of the
Egyptian population after its turbulent early days with shaykh ÝUmar ÝAbd al-
KÁfÐ, the ‘shaykh of the stars’ (Abdo 2000: 143–152). No doubt the intense pathos
with which KhÁlid delivers his message is an important reason why people are
so infatuated with him, and his written language in this regard corresponds to his
high-pitched voice and tearful delivery in his live appearances. But there are other
factors that matter, too. The construal of the reader as a responsible Actor provides
an additional explanation as to why KhÁlid’s discourse (and charismatic religious
discourse generally, one might suspect) affects people to such a great degree. With
his combination of personal address and the casting of the reader as an active agent
in all his texts, KhÁlid can be said to raise the consciousness about the individual
as an agent who matters. Important building blocks in this image of the reality are
his use of pronouns and clauses full of material processes in which the reader is
given the role as Actor. These are not the only building blocks, to be sure, but the
transitivity structure is interesting because it brings its own, unstated meaning into
the text, and because it contributes to an atmosphere and thrust in the discourse
that are bound to leave an impact on the reader.
106 Islamist rhetoric
6 The rhetoric of religious
polemics
MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s (b. 1931) project can be best described by himself, in two
extracts from the book Hal al-Islm huwa al-h
.all? Li-mdh wa-kayf? (Is Islam
the solution? Why and how?) (ÝImÁra 1995):
The ultimate intention and widest horizon of the current call to Islam is to
revive and renew all aspects of Islam in all fields of human life. This is to be
achieved by replacing corruption with Islamic reform.

The rhetoric of religious polemics 107
If our nation complains about civilizational backwardness, then its lifebelt is
civilizational revival and renewal. The fiercest enemy of this renewal is imi-
tation [taqld]. For imitating imported Western civilizational models hinders
the disposition towards innovation and creativity. The nation will not rise
except by renewal, and there will be no renewal if the nation does not feel
that it needs it, that it is necessary. And none of this will come about except
if it feels that, in the renaissance [nahd
.a], it possesses a plan that is distinct
from other plans belonging to other civilizations. At that point, need propels
it towards revival and renewal, and the inclination towards innovation and
creativity grows, an inclination that would fade away and die in the shadow
of resemblance and imitation of others.
(p. 188)
With these words, MuÎammad ÝImÁra places himself in the tradition of JamÁl al-
DÐn al-AfghÁnÐ and MuÎammad ÝAbduh, and calls for a progressive Islamism that
remains true to the heritage of classical Islamic thought and an idea about Islam
as a separate and unique civilization. What is the background for this project, and
how does his approach to it situate him in the religious field?
Situating Muh
.ammad ‘Imra in the Islamic field
MuÎammad ÝImÁra is one of those intriguing Arab intellectuals who have trans-
formed themselves from Marxism-inspired iconoclasts to staunch supporters of
the ‘authentically Islamic’ in questions of culture, politics and religion. ÝImÁra
graduated from Cairo’s DÁr al-ÝulÙm, and also got his doctoral degree from that
institution.This fact is telling in regard to his thought and his position in the Islamic
field. In a study of the relationships between al-Azhar and Cairo University,
Donald Malcolm Reid (1990) shows that the DÁr al-ÝulÙm, which was established
late in the nineteenth century by Khedive Ismail, was part of an effort to modern-
ize the education given at al-Azhar. This made DÁr al-ÝulÙm the target of criticism
from both al-Azhar and Cairo University, since its epistemology was a middle
way between the two others (ibid.: 12). Reid outlines three trajectories for the
graduates of DÁr al-ÝulÙm. Some aimed at a career in the state educational system
and adopted rather secular views, others stayed with the institution to teach and
remained in the middle, while a third group chose Islamism: both Íasan al-BannÁ,
the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sayyid QuÔb, its great ideologue,
graduated from this institution (ibid.: 146–147).
MuÎammad ÝImÁra displays characteristics of both the latter groups. He calls
himself an Islamist and is hostile to intellectual ‘atheists’, and at the same time he
is a strong advocate of rationalism and tries to wed the theology of the MuÝtazila
and the thought of Ibn Rushd in his works (von Kügelgen 1994: 180–204). Thus,
he can safely be described as a centrist, an ideology of he is a staunch defender
(ÝImÁra 2000, 2005: 67–69), and this would seem to place him ideologically on
a par with YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and the independent Islamists (DiyÁb 2002; Polka
2003: 41–44). However, he is original and central enough to be regarded as a
108 Islamist rhetoric
writer and thinker in his own right. ÝImÁra is not a religious scholar, but neither is
he completely outside the religious establishment, being a member of al-Azhar’s
MajmaÝ al-buÎÙth al-islÁmiyya (the Academy of Islamic Research), where YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ also figures, together with several other prominent ulama. In his
books, ÝImÁra often tackles issues that are theological in nature or at least within
the sphere of the philosophy of religion. Although his programme for an Islamic
revival is stated in clear terms (e.g. ÝImÁra 1995: 203), these terms are very gen-
eral. For example, he often states the need for an Islamization of the individual and
society, but he never really details how to achieve it. This gives his discourse an
abstract flavour, in the same way as his frequent use of wide and sweeping terms
such as ‘the West’, ‘Islam’ and ‘materialism’ does. This separates him from both
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and ÝAmr KhÁlid, who both take an activist approach.
In his youth ÝImÁra had Marxist sympathies and joined a group of young intellec-
tuals who fought against imperialism and for world peace, and which incorporated
secular leftists as well as members of the Muslim Brotherhood (von Kügelgen
1994: 180). His role at this time brings to mind the Iranian thinker and activist ÝAlÐ
SharÐÝatÐ, who cultivated a kind of Islamic theology of liberation which was essen-
tialist and eclectic at the same time (e.g. Shariati 1979). Later, however, ÝImÁra
became a staunch anti-Marxist, focusing ever more on Islamic authenticity and
hostility towards external influences, whether in Islamic history or in contempo-
rary society. In line with classical Islamist thought (cf. Mitchell 1993), he thinks
that Persian, Greek and Byzantine influences corrupted the original Arab-Islamic
society and its thought, and views modern Western rationalism and materialism as
equally detrimental to what he calls ‘true’ Islam.
Being an accomplished intellectual, ÝImÁra has produced works of academic
quality, such as a critical edition of ÝAlÐ ÝAbd al-RÁziq’s al-Islm wa-us
.l al-
h
.ukm (ÝAbd al-RÁziq 2000). He is also one of the dominant figures behind the
Islamic intellectual journal al-Manr al-jadd, which takes its name and cue from
RashÐd RiÃÁ’s and MuÎammad ÝAbduh’s reformist publication in the first part
of the twentieth century (Hamzawy 2000). However, especially in recent years
he has published books or pamphlets consisting of very short and simple arti-
cles where substantial parts of the text are just quotations from the pioneers of
Islamic reform, and which are clearly intended for a less learned readership than
his academic books. This is part of his efforts to popularize the centrist mes-
sage, as testified also by his contributions on religion to Egyptian newspapers
such as al-Wafd (Abaza 1999: 100)1
and appearances on major satellite chan-
nels like al-JazÐra. In a significant recent development, articles from one of his
latest books, al-Islm wa-l-tah
.addiyt al-mu‘s
.ira (2005), were posted on ÝAmr
KhÁlid’s Web site, where they still are.2
At the same time, his mode of writing,
which is marked by a fondness for polemic, represents a style that ÝAmr KhÁlid is
a complete stranger to. Thus, the posting of his articles on the Web site constitutes
an interesting convergence between a controversial Islamic thinker and a preacher
who has until now avoided difficult social, political and religious issues as best
as he can. I will have more to say on the ambivalent relationship between their
discourses in Chapter 7.
The rhetoric of religious polemics 109
MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s fondness for polemic is attested to by the fact that he has
devoted whole books to refutations of outspoken liberals such as NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ
Zayd and MuÎammad SaÝÐd al-ÝAshmÁwÐ and roundly condemns ‘the West’ for its
supposedpromiscuity,materialismandgenerallackofmorality.Hispolemicalstance
has become more pronounced over the years, and von Kügelgen notes that ÝImÁra
shows ‘weniger Gesprächsbereitschaft gegenüber “Atheisten” und “Materialisten”
alserdiesnochindenachtzigerJahrentat’(1994:182).AgreeingwithvonKügelgen,
Mona Abaza states that the language in his criticism of NaÒr AbÙ Zayd in the mid-
1990s ‘denotes in the end a deeply vengeful frame of mind’(1999: 105).
Based on these characteristics a provisional identification of MuÎammad ÝImÁra
as a centrist polemicist would seem appropriate, at least from the end of the 1980s
up till now. It is this period which I am concerned with, and which Abaza labels
MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s ‘late Islamist phase of the eighties and nineties’(1999: 100).
Speaking in terms of religious capital, he is firmly placed among the elite in the
Islamic field. His movement between different formats of publishing and differ-
ent levels of sophistication in his books can be attributed to the relative freedom
he enjoys in the field, being in many ways a lone bird who is not easily identified
with a defined group such as religious scholars or the independent Islamists. To
further pinpoint his position, MuÎammad ÝImÁra is perhaps the one among the
centrists who has engaged in the most serious way with contemporary secular
thought (Najjar 2000: 198), a fact that could point in the direction of a will to
dialogue. He is also the one who has most comprehensively investigated the con-
temporary relevance of Islamic thought both in the classical age and at the turn of
the nineteenth century from a general point of view, trying to combine theology
and philosophy in the service of the modern renewal of Islam that the centrists
propagate. He is thus first and foremost an intellectual, and not a preacher like
ÝAmr KhÁlid and YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ.
The analysis approaches this characterization from the angle of language and
style, and will contribute an answer the following question: what is the relation
between the features we have reviewed above and the language he uses to communi-
cate his thoughts? I will also try to give a preliminary answer to the question of how
his language contributes to positioning him in the Islamic field, before moving on
to the comparative analysis of all three figures in the next chapter. First, however, a
short presentation of the source material on which the analysis is based is in order.
The main thematic characteristics of Muh
.ammad $Imra’s books
Among MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s almost 200 books, there is wide variation both in
themes and in the level of sophistication in the analyses. The books we analyse
here are meant for a general audience and focus on his own thought about Islamic
revival. This choice has been made in order to facilitate the comparison of his
works with the others in this study. It entails that a quite substantial part of his
literary production is disregarded, namely the specialized books that deal with the
thought of classical luminaries and the pioneers of the Islamic nahd
.a as well as the
direct polemics with other writers in contemporary Egypt (e.g. ÝImÁra 1996).
110 Islamist rhetoric
Within the general theme of Islamic revival, several subjects tend to appear
frequently in his books, and I have chosen books and essays that cover all these,
with varying degrees of depth: Islam, tradition and modern ideologies; Islamic
unity and pluralism; Islam and the ‘other’; Islam and the West; Islam and women’s
emancipation; and politics and justice in Islam. The works that cover these issues
are very numerous, but ÝImÁra’s concerns, positions and style in the last fifteen
years or so have been fairly consistent.3
Consequently, for the linguistic analysis I
have chosen to rely on a small number of relatively recent books that are all easily
available in the Arab world and beyond.
al-Islm wa-l-tah
.addiyt al-mu‘s
.ira (Islam and the contemporary challenges)
(2005) is the most recent and also the simplest one. It is a collection of two-page
articles about a number of issues, ranging from presentations of the great Islamic
thinkers of the nahd
.a to Islam and the ‘other’. Including long sections of quotes
(sometimes covering most of the article), the book retains an apologetic tone
throughout. It treats a number of subjects: Islam’s combination of plurality and
unity, Islam’s inherent will to reformism, the failure of the Western social model,
the need to meet the Western cultural onslaught with Islamic authenticity, wom-
en’s role in Islam, the cultural wars in the Arab world, and discussions on Islamic
fiqh. ÝImÁra’s main argument in the book is that the Islamic umma faces a three-
fold threat, from its own heritage of backwardness, a political/military threat from
the USA, and a cultural/intellectual invasion from the West generally. In order to
overcome the challenges there is a need to return to Islamic origins and understand
the laws governing civilizations’ rise and fall. In this way, the Islamic umma can
master the laws and emerge victorious.
al-Shar‘a al-islmiyya wa-l-‘almniyya al-gharbiyya (Islamic shar‘a and
Western secularism) (2003) is a distinctly polemical work that points out the
essential differences between Islamic and Western civilization, and how cultural
imperialism has secularized Islam and deprived it of its strength as a social and
political force. In this book, MuÎammad ÝImÁra draws on a number of more or
less obscure Western thinkers as well as modern politicians to show that Islamic
civilization is inherently different from Christian civilization and that the West is
and has always been filled with animosity towards Islam. Today’s Muslims should
strive towards combining the old (the heritage) with the new in dynamic ways,
since this is the essence of Islamic precepts. Only in this way can Islam be revived
as an active force in society.
al-Nas
.s
. al-islm bayn al-ijtihd wa-l-jumd wa-l-trkhiyya (Islamic scripture
between ijtihd, ossification and historicity) (2000) is a short booklet about the
correct Islamic method of approaching and interpreting the QurÞÁn. He argues
that the Islamic method is a middle way between those who refuse to perform
ijtihd, personal judgement based on reason, and those who disregard the original
judgements. The former misinterpret time-bound judgements for premises and
thus distort Islam’s wish to make life good for people, while the latter nullify not
only texts but the whole religion.
The title of the last book chosen for linguistic analysis, Hal al-Islm huwa al-
h
.all? Li-mdh wa-kayf? (Is Islam the solution? Why and how?) (1995), refers
The rhetoric of religious polemics 111
to the Islamist slogan used in elections by the Muslim Brotherhood. MuÎammad
ÝImÁra analyses how Islam relates to a number of important areas of social life: the
intellectual public sphere, domestic and foreign policy, social justice, civil freedoms
and rights and women’s position. The chapter on domestic politics gives a good
illustration of how the general argument goes, and provides a good illustration of
the Islamist way of combining traditional concepts and institutions with modern
ones. For ÝImÁra, the Islamic institution of counselling (shr) fulfils all the func-
tions of democracy, and is even more perfect, since it incorporates God’s will as an
absolute limit for human choice. He argues for a revival of the caliphate, which in
its modern form would mean a league of Islamic states united under a single central
governing body, much like the USAor the EU. He treats the issue of political parties
in the same way, writing that they are very similar to the different schools of fiqh.
However, the West introduced secular parties in the Islamic world, a concept that
is alien and un-Islamic. ÝImÁra does not accept pluralism with parties that are not
Islamic, but at the same time does not call for banning them, since this in his view
would only have negative effects. Instead, he wants to eradicate the idea of secular
parties from people’s minds with words, not by force. Islamic parties are a good,
and he argues that opposition and support of the ruler(s) are sanctioned by Islam.
ThestyleofwritinginallthesebooksisdistinctlyMuÎammadÝImÁra’s,although
there are some minor differences between them. I will return to this question later.
Let us now turn to the analysis of his language.
Personal reference and the civilizational divide
As in the analysis of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s use of personal reference, I counted
instances of such reference also in a text by MuÎammad ÝImÁra in order to give
an impression of their general distribution. The text is the first chapter of the book
Hal al-islm huwa al-h
.all? (ÝImÁra 1995), and covers twelve pages. I have counted
all the personal references that occur in this chapter, ignoring reported speech and
repetitions that point to the same referent within one clause:
I/my: 0 instances
you (sing.)/yours: 0 instances
he/his: 6 instances
she/her: 0 instances
we/our: 10 instances
we/our meaning I/my: 0 instances
you (pl.)/your: 0 instances
they/their: 10 instances
Considering that the pages in ÝImÁra’s books are rather densely filled with
text, the impression is that personal references are not as visible in MuÎammad
ÝImÁra’s books as they are in the texts of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and ÝAmr KhÁlid.
Furthermore, the references to the third person singular are not very interesting
from an interpersonal perspective, since they refer most often to figures like the
112 Islamist rhetoric
prophet MuÎammad, al-GhazÁlÐ or Ibn Rushd. As for the references to the third
person plural, they point to such varying figures as women, Muslims, ordinary
humans (bashar ‘diyyn) and representatives of different schools of thought. The
most interesting reference and the one I will focus on in the analysis is the first
person plural. These are equally divided between a writer-plus-reader ‘we’ and a
communal, general ‘we’. First, however, is a brief survey of other personal refer-
ences in his texts in general.
There are almost no references to the second person, and this fact illustrates clearly
the academic and impersonal nature of MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s discourse, in line with
the portrait given of him above. The lack of such references is a telling contrast to
ÝAmr KhÁlid’s intensely personal style, where second person references are every-
where. As for references to the third person plural, they are comparatively rare, and
typically signal distance to the signified in time or space. An example of the latter is
when it refers to people ÝImÁra criticizes and thus distances himself from:
And still – in the twenty-first century – we urge these westernized people,
who imitate Western modernization and call for joining the West, we still urge
them to distinguish between civilizational interaction and blind imitation.
(ÝImÁra 2005: 30)
The references to the third person singular are few and far between. Generally,
they serve the function of pointing to a specific entity outside the sphere of reader
and writer that may be evaluated positively or negatively.
The references to the first person plural, which are the most visible by far, have
three different meanings: ‘We’ as MuÎammad ÝImÁra himself only, ‘we’ as a reli-
gious/ethnic community and ‘we’ as MuÎammad ÝImÁra and the reader. The two
last are the ones that appear most often. I will treat them in the above order, start-
ing with the instances where MuÎammad ÝImÁra refers to only himself with the
use of ‘we’. The following example is typical of the way he refers to himself in
the source texts:
So, in this chapter, we present the views of, or in reality they are texts by, al-
GhazÁlÐ and Ibn Rushd (...).
(ÝImÁra 2005: 117)

The rhetoric of religious polemics 113
These references are comparatively rare and insignificant from an interpersonal
perspective. In Arabic academic writing, this way of self-referencing is the norm,
and seems to imply more modesty than the use of ‘I’, since the latter reference
is often used when the author wants to be more visible in the text. Having said
that, there are also a couple of cases where MuÎammad ÝImÁra adopts a narrative
rhetoric that resembles YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s (cf. pp. 127–129 ), and then he does
tend to use ‘I’:
Someone asked me once: ‘I wonder, who was the first to say that Islam is
the solution?’ I answered: ‘If you mean it in a historical sense, then God’s
Revelation and the QurÞÁnic message introduced the saying that Islam is the
way.
(ÝImÁra 1995: 23)
However, this is the exception. The majority of the relatively few references
MuÎammad ÝImÁra makes to himself are in the first person plural, and it is natural
to interpret their function as propping up the image of his texts as serious, aca-
demic pieces of work.
What, then, can be said about the interpersonal functions of the ‘communal
we’ and ‘writer-plus-reader we’? To understand their function we need to connect
them to other features of ÝImÁra’s language as well as the actual content of his
discourse. The ‘communal we’is composed of both an ethnic, geopolitical part and
a more purely religious part. The boundaries between them are vague. Sometimes
only one component seems to be intended, while at other times there is a mix, as
in the following excerpt, where he starts by referring to the Islamic umma, moves
on to a ‘we’that represents this umma, and then involves the Arabic language with
this ‘we’:
The Islamic nation experiences the problem of oppression, in which its
resources are paralysed by inherited backwardness and the threats posed by

114 Islamist rhetoric
Western hegemony, which is imposed upon it (...). So we get our food by beg-
ging, and our language – the language of the QurÞÁn and the tongue of Islam
– is cut off from being the language of science (...).
(ÝImÁra 1995: 9–10)
His ‘we’thus seems to mix the typical third worldist theme of nativism (Arabism in
this case) with a more comprehensive, pan-Islamic content.The only obvious ‘other’
in relation to the communal ‘we’is the West, which MuÎammad ÝImÁra posits as one
monolithic and homogeneous ‘civilization’– a central word in his discourse.
But Western civilization, which has invaded us for two centuries by its ideolo-
gies – positivism, secularism and materialism – has brought about new and
un-Islamic phenomena in our thought and reality – in the field of pluralism.
Among these is the acceptance of a political and philosophical pluralism that
is not committed to an Islamic frame of reference, and that does not appeal to
what are indisputable facts of religion.
(ÝImÁra 1995: 89)
Unlike YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s use of ‘we’, which can easily be interpreted as more
exclusive because of the way he opposes it to several ‘others’ in the same sen-
tence, ÝImÁra’s use of pronouns is not geared to creating divisions within Arab
and Islamic society, but only between the Islamic and the Western ‘civilizations’.
He seems intent on determining that there is a ‘we’, an Arab, Islamic umma that
needs to be true to its religious identity, while he is not concerned about differen-
tiating between certain groups within the umma, as YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is. This
does not mean that there are no snakes in paradise. MuÎammad ÝImÁra criticizes
conservative ‘imitators’ (muqallidn) of classical authorities who do not see that
their mode of thought belongs to another epoch, as well as liberal imitators of the
godless West. The criticism of liberal thinkers is particularly venomous, and there
is no doubt that ÝImÁra regards them as out of bounds. But on the whole, while he
has clear opinions which he states frequently, his mode of writing construes him
as an analyst and observer (although a partisan one) of his culture and society
more than YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ. In the spirit of the partisan observer, ÝImÁra clearly
states his preference for the wasat
.iyya trend, while often tending to construe
himself as external to this trend or Islamic thought and civilization in general, thus
distancing himself and the readers from the entities he writes about:

The rhetoric of religious polemics 115
Something about which there can be no doubt is that the current reality of the
Islamic nation shows it to be at a distinct historical juncture.
(ÝImÁra 2005: 4)
Here, he could have written ummatin l-islmiyya, but he chooses not to. In his
books, references to the Islamic umma, Arab countries and related entities are
sometimes qualified by the possessive ‘our’, and sometimes not. By choosing
the latter option when referring to the Islamic umma he reduces somewhat the
distance to both liberal thinkers and conservative ‘imitators’, because they are
also referred to in this way. Consequently, both the Islamic umma, with which he
clearly identifies, and trends of thought with which he clearly does not identify are
written about from an observer’s distance. In short, the pronoun system seems to
have a less active pragmatic role of denoting distance and nearness in MuÎammad
ÝImÁra’s texts than in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and ÝAmr KhÁlid’s.
Nevertheless, at this point I would like to draw a parallel to liberal and secu-
larist discourses that are stylistically comparable to MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s, and to
what seems like a structurally determined difference in their use of ‘we’ and ‘our’
when writing about antagonists. My example is taken from the texts of Sayyid
al-QimanÐ, a professor of history and a fiercely polemical secularist who has writ-
ten regularly in the weekly Rz al-Ysuf and published several books, most of
them collections of critical essays about religion and society. Pragmatically, the
possessive suffix ‘-nÁ’ signals both that there is a ‘we’ who own something and
some kind of bond, whether positive or negative, between the owner and what is
owned. So what are we to make of the fact that Sayyid al-QimanÐ, being a self-
proclaimed enemy of religious scholars and Islamists of all kinds, regularly refers
to his opponents as ‘our ulama’and ‘our misled [Islamist] youth’(al-QimanÐ 2004:
79–80)? I have not been able to find any instances of Islamists referring to liberals
and secularists with the possessive, and a reasonable interpretation of this fact is
that it signals not only distance, but exclusion. Textually speaking, then, for the
Islamists the liberals and seculars are aliens who do not have any relationship to
the big Arab and Islamic ‘we’, while, for secularists like Sayyid al-QimanÐ, the
‘we’ is more widely defined, and it is implied (grudgingly, perhaps) that Islamists
and conservative shaykhs are a part of ‘us’.
Is this to mean that secularists and liberals are more inclined towards dialogue
and inclusion? Judging from how Sayyid al-QimanÐ rants about the ahl al-dn on
nearly every page of his books, this is not necessarily the case. There is another,
structural explanation: the liberals and secularists cannot exclude Islamists and
religious scholars from their ‘we’, because it would backfire on themselves. The
reason for this is that, inArab public debate, orthodox Islam, Islamism and Islamic

116 Islamist rhetoric
activists are taken for granted as integral parts of society. They unquestionably
belong to the ‘we’ that is Arab Islamic society. Therefore any liberal or secularist
that tries to construct a ‘we’ that excludes Islamists and religious scholars will
automatically exclude him/herself instead. They are forced to write in an inclusive
way, whether they want to or not. Islamists, however, can easily exclude the liber-
als, because they are not generally taken for granted by the public. In this way, the
‘we’ as it is used in polemical writings on both sides results from and sustains the
unequal balance between Islamism and liberalism at one and the same time. For a
change to occur in this situation, it is the Islamists who must start including liber-
als and secularists in the Arab-Islamic ‘we’, but it is hard to see why they should
do so: they commonly regard liberals as having sold out or succumbed to the
Western imperialist enemy, and do not seem to think that there is anything posi-
tive or constructive whatsoever in the contributions by the liberals to Arab public
debate about Islam.
Let us move on now to ‘we’ as meaning MuÎammad ÝImÁra and the reader.
This meaning of ‘we’ is found most often in the booklet al-Nas
.s
. al-islm bayn
al-ijtihd wa-l-jumd wa-l-trkhiyya. Significantly, this is the most special-
ized book of the three I have analyzed. While Hal al-islm huwa al-h
.all? and
al-Islm wa-l-tah
.addiyt al-mu‘s
.ira are of a general nature and touch on many
different questions in several areas of Islamic culture and religion, al-Nas
.s
. is in
its entirety devoted to the question of interpretation of the QurÞÁn and sunna.
Perhaps this is what accounts for the almost total lack of communal ‘we’ that is
very much present in the two other books. Instead, in al-Nas
.s
., the ‘we’that dom-
inates the text is what might be termed the academic, inclusive ‘we’. Consider
the following examples. The first one is taken from a discussion about liberal
interpretation of the QurÞÁn that does not adhere to time-honoured exegetical
principles:
We find that this frivolous direction has made the interpretation [ta’wl] of the
religious text the rule and not the exception...
(ÝImÁra 2000: 24)
And if we want to give examples...
(ÝImÁra 2000: 48)
As Nigel Harwood concludes in a study about English academic writing, the
inclusive ‘we’ ‘help[s] the writers construct dialogism between themselves and
the audience by establishing the presence of the readership in the text, making the
discourse reciprocal’ (Harwood 2005: 347).

The rhetoric of religious polemics 117
The effect is to create a ‘positively polite tenor of solidarity’ (ibid.: 365).
However, Harwood also notes that the inclusive ‘we’ can be used manipulatively.
It can make the readers feel they participate in an intellectual journey when in
reality it is the writer who decides on all the crucial issues: what presuppositions
are being made, what questions are being asked and what answers are being given.
Considering MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s decidedly polemic style, this is a point that
deserves attention and to which I will return below. At any rate, ÝImÁra’s selective
use of personal pronouns in different books betrays a certain degree of sensitivity
in regard to the reader-in-the-text that seems greater than both ÝAmr KhÁlid’s and
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s. He is careful to put emphasis on a reader-friendly ‘we’when
he presents arguments, while the ‘communal we’ is prominent in the two books
on general issues, and especially where he merely states his opinions instead of
outlining an argument in support of them.An impressionistic judgement is that the
‘communal we’is especially conspicuous in al-Islm wa-l-tah
.addiyt al-mu‘s
.ira
(2005), which is the book least given to argument and most to ‘telling and show-
ing’, but this would have to be corroborated by a quantitative analysis for which
there is not enough space in this work. In any case, ÝImÁra seems to have made
a clear choice about using different persuasive tools according to what might be
called the academic levels of his books. He acts both as an authoritative guide,
although less so than YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, and an academic who seems to take the
critical reader seriously.
Arguing for the reader
Although as a result of his academic style MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s discourse is much
more impersonal than ÝAmr KhÁlid’s, all kinds of texts need to relate to the reader
in one way or the other, whether directly or indirectly. How does ÝImÁra include
concern for the reader in his texts? I have already made reference to Harwood’s
(2005) academic ‘we’, which is a visible part of ÝImÁra’s argumentative texts.
Geoff Thompson (2001) notes that an important quality in good academic texts is
that they ‘argue with the reader’. As Thompson states, ‘[a]chieving involvement,
through a convergence of the reader with the reader-in-the-text, is a crucial step
in most types of argumentative, persuasive text, including academic papers and
assignments’. Most of MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s texts are certainly argumentative and
persuasive, so a short investigation of his texts along Thompson’s lines would
seem in order. Thompson identifies three options to perform ‘overt dialogic inter-
action’ with the reader: commands (e.g. ‘consider the following fact’); various
kinds of questions; and statements from the reader-in-the-text, expressing antici-
pated objections, that are brought in by the writer only to be contradicted. Hyland
(2005: 42–43, 54) mentions the same textual tools in academic texts, labelling
them ‘engagement markers’. Keeping these in mind, can ÝImÁra be said to argue
with the reader by involving him/her?
On the first and last points, the answer is no. There are some formulations in
ÝImÁra’s texts that could in a sense be interpreted as constituting mild commands,
such as
118 Islamist rhetoric
We should view it [the Islamic circle] as embracing and containing secondary
circles of belonging...
(ÝImÁra 1995: 166)
But apart from the fact that this is a less than obvious example of commands to
the reader, such modalized propositions are few and far between, and I found no
straightforward commands to the reader in the texts I studied. As for statements
that are brought in and then contradicted, of the kind: ‘One would perhaps think...
However, ...’, I also did not find any. That is a significant fact, since this resource
is the one that enters into a dialogue with other and explicitly stated beliefs to the
greatest extent. MuÎammad ÝImÁra does not seem interested in conceding pos-
sible objections to his arguments and then contradicting them. In other words, he
does not want to give the impression that other positions than his own might be
plausible, although wrong. When he brings in other views than his own to discuss,
it is obvious from the outset that he condemns and despises them. This is apparent
in the works currently under discussion, and even more so in his polemics against
the liberals (e.g. ÝImÁra 1996).
However, two features of ÝImÁra’s texts do perform interactive tasks, in the
sense of guiding and/or including the reader in the unfolding of the argument.
The first of these is his use of interrogatives, and the second is his use of certain
cohesive markers, notably idh kna... fa. Both these features are also important
ideological textual tools. Let us start with the interrogatives. Questions are an
important resource in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s texts. Tellingly, the very title of one
of the books that is discussed here has the form of a question: Hal al-islm huwa
al-h
.all? This question is obviously dialogic – a question asked by the reader-in-
the-text to be answered by the writer. There are some other examples of the same
kind of questions inside his books too, for example:
But – what happened in our modern age?
(ÝImÁra 1995: 122)
And at times he will quote passages from other writers, mainly classical religious
authorities, where a clear interaction between writer and reader is intended. (Of
course, the whole structure of many classical works, especially in the later, scho-
lastic tradition, was based on questions and answers, testifying to Arabic scholas-
ticism’s awareness of the need for engaging the reader!) Consider the following
passage, where he refers to the thirteenth-century religious jurist ShihÁb al-DÐn

The rhetoric of religious polemics 119
al-QarÁfÐ begins his exposition on this issue by stating question thirty-nine,
which says:
What is correct in these judgements which appear within the schools
of al-ShÁfiÝÐ, MÁlik, and others, which result from custom and tradition,
[something which] has made the ulama absolutely certain about these
judgements?
(...)
After stating this question, al-QarÁfÐ goes on to answer: (...)
(ÝImÁra 2000: 88–89)
However, it is a different kind of question that is really dominating in his books:
the rhetorical question whose answer is self-evident. Rhetorical questions are of
course as much an interactional tool as other questions, but here we enter into the
domain of manipulation, mentioned by Harwood (2005) above, at the beginning
of this section. When MuÎammad ÝImÁra asks
So should we [not] review the mistaken ‘secularist presuppositions’ in this
field?!
at the end of a chapter whose sole purpose is to prove the claims of the secular-
ists wrong (ÝImÁra 2005: 122), the expected answer is clearly ‘yes’. Sometimes
he also answers the questions explicitly himself (e.g. ÝImÁra 2000: 49–50). Such
questions mark MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s discourse as a strongly polemic one, and set
him apart from YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, who uses questions in a more didactic way in
order to move the argument in the text forward. For MuÎammad ÝImÁra, questions
are clearly used for more overtly ideological purposes.
A passage from Hal al-islm huwa al-h
.all? about the question of women and
equality between the sexes is particularly telling in this regard. This is not sur-
prising, since, together with the human rights question, women’s emancipation
is a moot point on the Islamist agenda, and one where Islamist discourse often

120 Islamist rhetoric
assumes a defensive position. Arab liberals quote different QurÞÁnic verses and
hadiths to prove that a literal understanding of these sources leads to the oppres-
sion of women. One of these is a hadith from the collections of al-BukhÁrÐ and
Muslim, in which the Prophet is reported to have said to a group of women that
they have mental and religious ‘defects’ because their testimony is worth only
half of a man’s, and because they cannot fast or pray when they are menstruating.
ÝImÁra argues on the contrary that Islam liberates women and, to his credit, he
unblinkingly takes on the challenge from Arab liberals. In Hal al-islm huwa al-
h
.all? he deals with the ‘shubht’(‘suspicions’) on the part of ‘westernized’people
who claim that Islam cannot lead to women’s emancipation (ÝImÁra 1995: 150–
152). Not being able or willing to assume a historical-critical position towards the
words of the Prophet, ÝImÁra must devise an interpretation of this hadith that saves
both Islam and women from blame and thus proves that the liberals’ accusations
are wrong. I have quoted a substantial part of the explanation, since it is a con-
densed example of ÝImÁra’s debating style:

The rhetoric of religious polemics 121
We would like to ask:
Does the hadith about God’s Prophet (peace be upon him) here about
‘mental and religious defects’ amount to censure? Or is it a statement about
reality not implying criticism? In fact, it might even be a reality that is
praised?!
In any event, a blameworthy defect is one that ceases to exist once it is
changed... Now, is it allowed for women to rectify their defect as witnesses in
comparison with the testimony of men, so that blame no longer applies to it?
Of course it is not... So she is rewarded and praised [by God] on account of
this ‘defect’, because she follows God’s law by having it... Accordingly, it is
not a blameworthy defect, but a praiseworthy one!?
And is the menstruating woman allowed to pray and fast, so that her
‘religious defect’ ceases to apply to her? Not at all, for if she nullified this
‘religious defect’ she would be blamed for committing something that is
forbidden in religion... She is rewarded spiritually by adhering to this ‘reli-
gious defect’, so it is a praiseworthy shortcoming! Consequently, the point
of the prophetic hadith is to state a divinely ordained fact of reality which
women are rewarded and praised for observing. Its point is not to blame her
and underestimate her abilities and her equal value with men. If this were
the case, should men then be viewed as having a mental defect when they
are not allowed to give testimony at all, in cases where only the testimony
of women is accepted?! And should they be regarded as lacking in religious
qualities when they employ the [divinely sanctioned] licence to cease fast-
ing when they are ill or when they travel, or when they shorten their prayers
during travel?!
He goes on with questions like these for a couple of paragraphs more before he
ends the passage by claiming that the point of the hadith is to show that the ‘weak
intellect’ of women makes room for their strong emotive nature, which overrides
not only their own reason, but also sometimes that of determined men. Thus, in
his opinion the hadith is meant to show how the different natures of men and
women complement each other in the best possible way (ÝImÁra 1995: 152). This
passage illustrates neatly how MuÎammad ÝImÁra escapes the real issue (that the
Prophet himself called women lacking in religion and intellect using religious
dogma as proof) by manipulating the natural way of reading the hadith, so that the
unequivocally negative term nqis
.t (deficient, fem. pl.) that appears in the hadith
is turned into a positive value that affirms God’s wisdom. The underlying logic
can be phrased thus: ‘Is this a blameworthy defect? A blameworthy defect is one
that ceases to exist if it is changed. Since women are not allowed to testify alone
and pray or fast while they are menstruating, their defects cannot be changed, and
thus they are not blameworthy. Accordingly, they are praiseworthy.’ This reason-
ing is rather creative, but its artificial nature is obscured by putting the burden of
122 Islamist rhetoric
evidence on the reader through rhetorical questions throughout. In the process,
ÝImÁra jumps almost imperceptibly from the question of a permanent property of
women to temporary arrangements for men (exemption from fasting when ill or
travelling), thus juxtaposing two very different situations.
He ends the argument by asking: ‘So where among these meanings [of the
hadith] is the accusation that some people talk about?’ Characteristically, he does
not even concede that it might be possible to read the hadith in a less apologetic
way before dismissing the liberals who take the more radical step of questioning
the authenticity of hadiths like this. Throughout this passage, the reader is given no
chance to reflect, but is instead bombarded with questions that effectively coerce
him/her into agreement with the writer. In this context, Halliday’s ‘discretionary
alternative’ for the reader, i.e. answering ‘no’ where a ‘yes’ is clearly asked for
(Thompson and Thetela 1995: 18; Halliday 2004: 108–109), is not a real option,
because it would lead to a breakdown in the communication between writer and
reader. If ÝImÁra had chosen instead to present his case by propositions stating
his opinion, it would have been easier for the reader to disagree and still feel that
the discussion could go on fruitfully. The rhetorical questions have the effect of
directly challenging the reader, asking, ‘Are you with me or against me?’, which
makes it difficult to disagree without damaging the relationship between writer
and reader. In this way, ÝImÁra attempts to force the reader to go along with his
arguments.As Geoff Thompson and Puleng Thetela write of a similar construction
in a different context, ‘The text can thus be seen as selecting its own readers, those
who do not give the “wrong” answer.’ In other words, ÝImÁra’s texts are likely to
chase away people who do not already agree with him.
The other feature so prominent in ÝImÁra’s more academic texts that it needs
to be treated is his conspicuous use of the cohesive marker idh kna... fa. This
logical connection (Halliday 2004: 373–383) between clauses and paragraphs in
ÝImÁra’s texts appears often and has obvious interpersonal ramifications. Thus,
they correlate with ÝImÁra’s use of personal pronouns in that they contribute to
distinguishing the more argumentative books from the ‘simpler’ones by explicitly
making the reader participate in a chain of reasoning.
The default function of the idh... fa construction is the if... then relationship,
as is reflected in the examples given in Badawi, Carter and Gully’s grammar of
Modern Written Arabic (2004: 657–658). However, as their examples show, the
construction has rhetorical functions in addition to its logical one. In his seminal
study of modern Arabic, Clive Holes identifies two main rhetorical functions of
conditional clauses with idha (Holes 2004: 296–297). The organizing conditional
clauses do not form part of the substance of the text, but merely serve to help
the reader follow the argument; Holes’s example is ‘If we move to Saudi Arabia,
we observe that...’ (Holes provides the example in English translation only). The
textual ones, however, are directly connected to the arguments being put forward
in the text. It is the latter type that dominates ÝImÁra’s texts, and specifically the
sub-type where the protasis has the verbal structure of idhÁ + kÁna + main verb,
for example:
The rhetoric of religious polemics 123
Although the Islamic ulama and thinkers from all the different schools of
thought differed about the question as to whether one should employ little or
much speculative interpretation [ta’wl], they nevertheless agreed to resorting
to it as a way of realizing and imagining that which the explicit text does not
reveal the full truth about (...).
(ÝImÁra 2000: 29)
Given that the essence of the Islamic creed is unity [tawh
.d] of the divine
Being, then admission of other authorities than the divine one regarding the
solving of problems in human society represents a distortion of the purity of
the Islamic creed of oneness, moving it more towards heathen, polytheistic
beliefs than towards the Islamic belief in unity..
(ÝImÁra 1995: 13)
In the first excerpt, the most natural interpretation is ‘although the ulama of Islam
differed... they nevertheless agreed on resorting to speculative interpretation...’
In the second excerpt, it is apparent that the only meaning intended can be ‘given
that the essence of the Islamic creed is tawh
.d of the divine Being, then/so admis-
sion of other authorities than the divine one... represents a distortion of the purity
of the Islamic creed of oneness...’An ‘if’ would be meaningless in this sentence,
since what is at stake is one of the central dogmas of Islam. As Holes notes, such a
sentence, ‘far from betokening a condition, in fact means “given that it is the case
that...”’(2004: 297).5
Signalling concession and condition, these cohesive markers
give MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s texts an image of proceeding based on logic: the reader,
who has already been invited to share MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s perspective by the
inclusive ‘we’ (see the section ‘Personal reference and the civilizational divide’
above), is asked to consider a logical string of arguments. MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s
discourse thus appears to be built on transparent arguments.
However, closer inspection of the structure of the texts reveals that propositions
outside of the ‘if... then’ logical relationship are just as important to his polemical

purpose as the arguments that are ostensibly his main concern. ÝImÁra frequently
inserts bulky, fronted adverbials and long, explanatory relative clauses in the mid-
dle of main clauses which carry a meaning of their own. From the evidence in the
material studied here, it is reasonable to claim that these constituents have two
related rhetorical functions. One is to present sometimes controversial arguments
in a position where they are not made open to discussion unless the reader makes
an effort to distance her/himself from the text. The other is to simply repeat infor-
mation or arguments that are not necessarily central to the content of the main
clause which they precede, but that rather serve to hammer in some previously and
often made assertions about Islam, the West, Christianity and so on.
Consider the following example of a very long adverbial, which conveniently
throws light on both functions at once. The main clause comes at the end, and
contains the argument that Western imperialism turned religious minorities in the
Islamic world from being an integral part of society to becoming a bridgehead for
the invaders.

The rhetoric of religious polemics 125
Despite the fact that it was the Islamic conquests that saved the Eastern
Christians from the mass murder that the Romans and the Byzantines com-
mitted against them for six whole centuries... These conquests in fact made
of Christianity ‘Islam’s gift’... In addition, these conquests opened the doors
of the Eastern cities, including Jerusalem, to the Jews, after [their subjection
to] genocide, persecution and harassment, and after the citizens of Jerusalem
demanded from the Commander of the faithful ÝUmar bin al-KhaÔÔÁb, on the
day he conquered the city in the year 15 A.H., 616 A.D [sic], that no Jews or
thieves should be allowed to live there!
And despite the fact that the religious tolerance that distinguished the East
from the West began with Islam, since it is only Islam’s adherents that believe
in all the prophecies, holy books and divine commandments, and who respect
and venerate all the sanctities of all other religious communities, as a result of
its [Islam’s] philosophy of pluralism, which it views as one of God’s norms
and as a natural law which cannot be replaced or altered (...)
And despite the absence of any religious wars in the history of the Islamic
East, because the Islamic faith is a firm belief from the heart and cannot come
about by force, not to speak of intimidation (...), and since the Islamic shar‘a
has declared, since the days of the Prophet’s state, that ‘those of other reli-
gions shall have the same rights and obligations as the Muslims, so that
they can participate in their rights and obligations’...
While the religious wars within Western Christianity, between the Catholics
and the Protestants, raged for more than a century, leaving 40 per cent of
the population of Central Europe dead!! – So, when Christianity prevailed in
Europe, Western societies became empty of religious pluralism.
Despite all of this, the modern imperialist Western invasion of the Islamic
world transformed the religious and ethnic minorities from being bricks
in the national and civilization security wall to becoming security loop-
holes...

126 Islamist rhetoric
In this passage, we can see clearly that the adverbial ‘despite’ has been turned into
a forceful argument of its own, partly independent of what is the theme or topic of
the main clause. The main clause covers five lines at the end. In contrast, what may
be viewed as three coordinated adverbials at the beginning cover no fewer than four
paragraphs, the fourth one being embedded in the third. These adverbials comprise
several embedded clauses with a number of substantial claims about history and
religion. Not all of these claims are completely uncontroversial: the assertion that
there have been no religious wars in the Islamic world could easily be challenged,
as could the statement that the East has been characterized by religious tolerance,
in contrast to the West. There are several examples that there have been plenty of
religious wars and persecution in both West and East over the centuries, even if the
Islamic empire has a much cleaner record in this regard than Europe. The implicit
assertion that Islam has a ‘philosophy of pluralism’is also less than clear, unless plu-
ralism is to be defined as the acceptance that other religions than Islam exist in soci-
ety, which would in this context be a minimal definition, to say the least. However,
none of these arguments can be questioned unless the reader consciously makes an
effort to direct attention away from the natural, ‘default’carriers of arguments in any
text, the subject and the finite verb, which are at the core of any verbal clause. Thus,
the argument which is immediately open to discussion in this excerpt is whether ‘the
modern imperialist Western invasion of the Islamic world’did or did not ‘transform’
religious and ethnic minorities. As noted, this argument is presented only at the end
of the whole harangue. The other claims, which are at least as controversial as the
main clause argument, are simply taken for granted as parts of the various adverbials
(‘despite [the fact] that...’). It requires a conscious effort from the reader to recode
these adverbials as separate propositions and thus make them contestable. In other
words, MuÎammad ÝImÁra makes it difficult for the reader to consider a number of
claims that are highly relevant to his general theme (since the book is about the dif-
ferences between Islam and the West) by presenting them as given facts outside the
argument in the main clause. I will return to this point below.
Let us now turn to the second function I mentioned above: the simple fact
that ÝImÁra crams a large amount of repetitive information into the adverbial.
For the sake of the main clause, something along the lines of ‘despite the fact
that religious minorities were well integrated in Islamic society because of its
tolerant nature’ would have been sufficient as an adverbial. But, for some reason,
MuÎammad ÝImÁra here and elsewhere takes the opportunity to present a long
bullet list of points that are not parts of an argument, but merely taken-for-granted
illustrations of an absolute dichotomy – in this case, between the West and Islam.
What are the implications of this?
In a very interesting article about Stalinist panegyrics, Karen Gammelgaard
(2008), drawing on Daneš (1995), analyses a Czech academic article in terms of
its ‘compositional relations’, one of which she labels ‘confrontation’. The text she
studies is among other things constructed around a dichotomy between ‘progres-
sive’ and ‘bourgeois’ literary history, and the following remarks are pertinent to
the present study:
The rhetoric of religious polemics 127
When the basic dichotomy is verbalized, a whole set of pleonasms occur, (...).
The overuse of pleonasms frequently brings about repetition of adverbs,
prepositional phrases, conjunctions and verbs. This makes it possible to
simulate that new things are said, while only stereotypic repetition takes
place.
(Gammelgaard 2008: 55)
In the passage above, the ideas that Islam is a tolerant religion and that religious
minorities have always enjoyed freedom and peace under Islam are repeated thrice
in slightly different terms, with the attendant repetition of the adverbial expres-
sion raghma (anna) (despite (the fact that...)). The antithesis to this is of course
Western Christianity and Western civilization generally. Nothing new is added;
instead, MuÎammad ÝImÁra pounds on the same idea, which is a sub-theme of the
basic Islam/West dichotomy that the whole book in question is about. Moreover,
the idea of a basic dichotomy between the Islamic East and the Christian/secular
West is central in all the works under discussion here, and in many other books by
MuÎammad ÝImÁra as well. Without drawing the comparison too far, it is notewor-
thy that Gammelgaard describes a text culture that has succumbed to a repressive
ideological (and physical!) hegemony and that is not capable of renewing itself or
producing creative scientific works.
Both these functions – the placing of claims outside the sphere of argument
and the repetition of what is perceived as given truths – are realized not only by
adverbials but also by embedded constituents such as appositions and relative
sentences:
If we want examples of what kinds of fruit this useless, speculative interpreta-
tion yields – [a method] devoid of any principles on which to rely – we find
the interpretive escapades that make of the words of the Prophet (peace be
upon him): ‘He to whom I am his master, ÝAlÐ will be his master’, a renuncia-
tion of his own prophethood (...).

128 Islamist rhetoric
And because Islam’s universality makes it a liberational revolution, which
made the founding generation – since the era of the rightly guided caliphs
– conduct a liberational war for the sake of the Eastern peoples against the
dominating and oppressive civilizational powers of that time, the Persians
and the Romans, because of this a series of Western hostilities against Islam
started from that date.
(ÝImÁra 2005: 9)
According to this fact, namely, that the essence of the Islamic system is God’s
appointment of Man [as a guardian of Creation], the Islamic caliphate was the
core of the Islamic ‘system’ that realized the principles and intentions of this
[divine] appointment..
(ÝImÁra 1995: 67)
Despite this clear and unequivocal Islamic position on the legitimacy, or
rather necessity, of opposition – whenever there is cause for it – it is always

present to take on the duty of supervising and keep to account the powers that
be. In other words, opposition is a permanent political task of supervision in
society. As for raising the voice with an oppositional message, that requires
the presence of some evil which necessitates opposition, and this is a task
that cannot be fulfilled by individuals, on account of how complex political
life and society are. Opposition, supervision and political accounting need
institutions and systems, especially when it comes to proposing alternatives
to change that which must be changed. Despite this clear and unequivocal
Islamic method, ‘suspicions’ have been raised about whether opposition is
legitimate in an Islamic system. These suspicions rely on the views and inter-
pretations of a minority of religious jurists from the centuries of despotism
and civilizational decline, or on texts that are consciously misinterpreted by
removing them from their context, a fact which calls for a discussion of these
‘suspicions’..
(ÝImÁra 1995: 97)
In the first example, the apposition – which is embedded in the adverbial within
the adverbial clause – is a strongly negative judgement of the epistemic basis in
liberal Islamic approaches to the QurÞÁn. The claim that this kind of ta’wl does not
have any proper basis in principles is highly contestable. NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd,
for example, draws on an elaborate theoretical framework based on Yuri Lotman’s
semiotic theory and Roman Jakobson’s notions of communication, among other
works (AbÙ Zayd 2000: 19, 25), in addition to numerous scholars from the clas-
sical Islamic age. ÝImÁra’s placement of this claim in a syntactic position where
it cannot be made an object of dispute unless the reader consciously makes it
one is an example of the first function I mentioned above: a manipulative way of
influencing the reader. As an aside, a parallel can be made here to a very differ-
ent writer. The linguist Michael Hoey states in an article about Noam Chomsky’s
rhetoric in linguistic debates: ‘[T]he inclusion of his evaluations in such a form
[embedded in the constituents of the main clause] allows him to present a running
commentary without at any stage forcing him to justify his commentary as he
gives it’ (Hoey 1999: 33). Commenting on Chomsky’s rhetorical practice, Hoey
writes that his ‘chief rhetorical device is to make it difficult for a reader to support
an alternative or opposing view to Chomsky’s own without looking foolish’(ibid.:
30). MuÎammad ÝImÁra certainly makes it difficult for his reader to entertain ques-
tions or doubts about the claims made; as for making him/her feel foolish, it is
interesting to recall the use of rhetorical questions that are designed to show how
obvious his claims are.
In the second excerpt, the supposed main message is that the West started to
behave with enmity towards Islam. But, despite this being the content of the main
clause mood structure, the adverbial clause which starts with ‘wa-li-anna’ (and
because) carries the most salient meaning, since it states that Islam’s spread con-
stituted a ‘liberational revolution’ as against the tyranny of West and East. Again,
we are presented with the argument that MuÎammad ÝImÁra repeats over and over
130 Islamist rhetoric
in his texts, and which he construes as simply a given truth, part of the background
of all things, by placing it outside the argument of the clause.
The third excerpt is a good example of how he helps his reader remember the
important points as the discussion proceeds, since the two pages immediately pre-
ceding this excerpt contain longer arguments to the same effect. Consequently, we
can speak of pleonasm here, with MuÎammad ÝImÁra repeating the same idea to
emphasize his argument.
In the fourth example, the embeddings, repetitions and digressions are so
numerous that a grammatical analysis would be very complicated. This is also
an example of pleonasm, where repetitions and emphases are heaped on top of
one another. As in the previous example, the purpose here is to bolster the argu-
ment on the preceding pages, where ÝImÁra deals with political freedom and the
right to opposition in Islam. The embeddings and insertions of sub-clauses here
are so dense that the reader almost gets lost before the initial thematized adver-
bial is restated: ‘raghma hadh...’ (despite this), and the main clause is finally
introduced.
This style amounts to more than the usual parallelism and pleonasm in Arabic,
as discussed by David Justice (1987: 181–186). When seen in connection with
ÝImÁra’s message, the fact that he makes questionable claims and evaluations in
embedded parts of the sentence is clearly ideological in nature, and the repetition
is so visible that it appears as more than a generic rhetorical feature of Arabic.
Barbara Johnstone’s remark, in her book about Arabic rhetoric, that ‘making
certain things “present” in discourse is a way of arguing about them, and para-
phrastic repetition is among the key techniques for creating presence’(1991: 94)
would seem appropriate here. But, unlike Johnstone, I see no reason for arguing
that this is a generic feature of what she calls ‘persuasive texts’, since there are
other texts in the same genre in Egypt that do not exhibit this degree of repeti-
tion, pleonasm and paraphrase. More in line with Gammelgaard’s analysis of
Stalinist panegyrics, I think that these features point in the direction of a specific
discourse community or text culture. They are distinctive of a certain group of
agents in the Islamic field, and this has serious ideological ramifications which
call for a partial reappraisal of the Islamic field. I will return to this point in
Chapter 7, where I compare the findings in the analysis with general trends in
the Islamic field in Egypt.
At this point, I will confine the discussion to the textual sphere. A summary of
the argument made in this section is that MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s argumentative style,
which seemingly invites the reader to join an intellectual exploration, is in several
respects a sham. He does not argue with the reader. He argues for him/her by pre-
senting preconceived ideas as given truths in incontestable parts of the sentences.
He seems unwilling to consider possible alternative ways of reasoning, and uses
the interactional resources to guide the reader along a narrow path of argument,
obscuring from his/her view parallel paths or other paths that branch off from the
current one.
The rhetoric of religious polemics 131
The grammar of an authentic Islamic civilization
How is ÝImÁra’s impersonal tone, which I commented on above, reflected in the
ideational aspect of his texts? Let us start by considering the following excerpt,
which I referred to above (p. 128) because of its repetition and syntactic complex-
ity. This piece of text is also a typical example of how ÝImÁra construes processes
and participants:
In this quote there is only one reference to human agency, and an indirect one
at that: a minority of jurists in the classical age. There are many processes, but
they are passivized (reasons for opposition ‘are found’, the exegeses of texts
‘have been done badly’, texts ‘have been taken’ out of context ), or construed
without human agency (accusations ‘have arisen’), or expressed as verbal
nouns, obscuring agency altogether (li-l-qiyÁm bi-farÐÃat al-murÁqaba (to take
on the duty of supervising), taqdÐm al-badÁÞil li-taghyÐr mÁ lÁ budda lahu min
al-taghyÐr (proposing alternatives to change that which must be changed)).
The dominant characteristic of all his books is abstraction achieved through a
combination of nominalization and the fact that large-scale and more or less
intangible entities are at the forefront of attention. Typical such entities are
Islam, the Islamic method (minhj) and civilization, the West, imperialism and
secularism.

Consequently, for the purposes of a transitivity analysis, an interesting
question is how ÝImÁra construes the prominent ideas and concepts, includ-
ing Islam. Consider the following excerpts from al-Islm wa-l-tah
.addiyt al-
mu‘s
.ira:
On the Islamic societal level, there are permanent elements of identity that
are equivalent to the uniting ties which make individuals into an umma, a
group, a society. They can even be considered a kind of glue that unites the
individuals of the umma by their sharing in these ‘permanent elements of
identity’ (...).
(ÝImÁra 2005: 15)
Islam allows for distinguishing between the different religious communities
and their laws. It leaves the adherents of every religion to their own creeds,
while [at the same time] the whole umma – across religious differences – falls
under a ‘civil Islamic’ authority that binds the faith communities together in
an umma (...).
(ÝImÁra 2005: 68)
Globalization – from the very term to its propositions, institutions and prac-
tices – is a Western idea aiming at casting the world in one, Western mould
(...).
(ÝImÁra 2005: 274)
In these excerpts, we see that the ‘elements of identity’, ‘Islam’and ‘globalization’
figure as Actors. The ‘permanent elements of identity’ make individuals into an

umma and unite them; Islam lets the adherents of each religion follow the pre-
cepts of that religion – within its overall governorship; and globalization wants
to melt and mould the world together according to one, Western form. These are
only three examples of many abstract concepts that are construed as active enti-
ties in ÝImÁra’s texts; others that figure in his books are ‘unity’ (wah
.da), ‘imi-
tation’ (taqld), ‘ossification’ (jumd), ‘the QurÞÁn’, ‘the West’ and ‘the Islamic
way/method’ (al-minhj al-islm).6
The practice of endowing ideas with agency
is found in all his books, regardless of genre and academic level. These concepts
and entities are construed as doing something to someone or something, and even
sometimes, as with globalization, as having a will of their own. In contrast to such
impersonal concepts, entities that are clearly connected to human agency, such as
persons, organizations or movements, are mentioned as Actors in sentences rela-
tively infrequently. There is one important exception to this, namely MuÎammad
ÝImÁra’s descriptions of the pioneers of Islamic reform: RifÁÝat al-ÓahÔÁwÐ, JamÁl
al-DÐn al-AfghÁnÐ, MuÎammad ÝAbduh and RashÐd RiÃÁ. They are often quoted
extensively, for example in al-Islm wa-l-tah
.addiyt al-mu‘s
.ira (ÝImÁra 2005).
Notwithstanding this, it is clear that, even where MuÎammad ÝImÁra construes
human agents as active, they tend to remain merely vehicles of already existing
ideas and concepts more than originators of substantial change. One example will
suffice to illustrate this point. I quote from the beginning and the end of a two-
page chapter called ‘FÐ l-ÝaqlÁniyya al-islÁmiyya’(‘On Islamic rationality’, ÝImÁra
2005: 107–108):
Faced with the non-religious rationalism which the positivist, Western
Enlightenment propagated, [an ideology] whose philosophers posited a

reason by the slogan ‘there is no other authority for reason than reason’..
Faced with this non-religious rationalism, JamÁl al-DÐn al-AfghÁnÐ (1254–
1314 AH, 1838–1897 AD), in what amounted to the founding of the plan for
an Islamic renaissance, called for reviving the believing Islamic rationalism.
This was because Islam and its civilization do not recognize this dichotomy
between reason and tradition which governed the philosophy of Western
Enlightenment in this field..
(...)
JamÁl al-DÐn al-AfghÁnÐ called for reviving this believing Islamic rational-
ism, which rejects ossification (...).
After quoting a passage about the importance of reason in Islam from one of
al-AfghÁnÐ’s works, MuÎammad ÝImÁra ends the chapter with the following
sentence:
In this way, al-AfghÁnÐ started the march towards a revival of the believing
Islamic rationalism as one of the elements among many in the plan for an
Islamic renaissance, in order to save the umma from ossification and imita-
tion.. and from Western interpretation – Western hermeneutics – which emp-
ties religion of religion!
The verb of which JamÁl al-DÐn al-AfghÁnÐ is the subject thrice in this passage
is da‘, ‘to call/invite’, so it is best characterized as a verbal process. In the last
sentence, al-AfghÁnÐ could be said to be the implicit agent of starting a march
and of saving the umma from ossification and imitation. Notwithstanding this,
al-AfghÁnÐ is construed mainly as a Sayer, not as an Actor: the emphasis is on
al-AfghÁnÐ as calling for or inviting to a revival and renaissance. Both these latter
words inherently imply that there is something to be revived or reborn. This some-
thing is ‘the believing Islamic rationality’, which is itself construed as an Actor: it
‘rejects’ossification.And the antithesis to this rationality is Western hermeneutics,
which is also an Actor, as it ‘empties religion of religion’. One can clearly discern
a bipolar world-view here, where Islam and the West are two acting entities, while
al-AfghÁnÐ is depicted as merely a representative of an already existing force or
potential that just has to be realized for the umma to rise again. I will elaborate on
this point shortly.
To conclude the present argument: whether MuÎammad ÝImÁra writes about
Islamic history or contemporary Islam, ideas and concepts instead of human
agency are at the forefront. This correlates with his limited use of personal pro-
nouns other than ‘we’, as we have seen above.

The rhetoric of religious polemics 135
Now what is the connection between this textual feature and ÝImÁra’s discourse
in general? To answer this question, we should first examine ÝImÁra’s active ideas
and concepts more closely and ask why impersonal concepts take precedence over
human agency in his texts. Of the terms I mentioned above, none are neutral. On
the contrary, they are highly charged and fall into the two categories of positive
and negative. Among the positive terms are Islam, thawbit al-huwya (fixed ele-
ments of identity), al-wah
.da (unity), al-minhj al-islm (the Islamic way/method)
and the QurÞÁn. On the negative side, we have taqld (imitation), jumd (ossifica-
tion), the West and ‘awlama (globalization). Taqld and jumd are verbal nouns,
i.e. they denote actions that originally have some kind of agency behind them, but
by employing the form of the verbal noun MuÎammad ÝImÁra puts emphasis on
these acts in themselves. In this way he makes them capable of being Actors in
their own right. The positive concepts obviously describe something authentically
Islamic, while the negative ones denote either deviations from the authentically
Islamic (taqld and jumd) or something that is the opposite of Islam (the West,
‘awlama).
By construing these concepts as active, ÝImÁra portrays a world in which inher-
ently Islamic and un-Islamic forces vie for domination. The impression of a black-
and-white world-view that this opposition seems to suggest is attested to also by
the way ÝImÁra entitles some of his books. Consider, for example, the titles al-
Shar‘a al-islmiyya wa-l-‘almniyya al-gharbiyya (Islamic shar‘a and Western
secularism) (ÝImÁra 2003) and al-Taqaddum.. wa-l-is
.lh
.: bi-l-tanwr al-gharb..
am bi-l-tajdd al-islm?? (Progress and reform: By Western Enlightenment or
Islamic renewal?) (ÝImÁra 1998b). In this scheme of Islamic and un-Islamic con-
test, time and historical development become irrelevant. Indeed, the concepts
thawbit al-huwya and al-minhj al-islm by their transhistorical nature obliter-
ate the relevance of historical development as a contributor to human develop-
ment. Instead, fixed qualities that stand in absolute opposition to each other are
used to explain both history and current affairs. The differences he posits between
the West and Islam, and the inherent will he construes both these entities as hav-
ing, confirm a similar world-view in some conservative circles in Europe and the
USA. The Christian Right in the USA and the George W. Bush administrations
are very visible examples. There is also a more and more vocal rightist movement
in Europe which views Islam in terms of a homogeneous movement with a will,
a definite purpose and a capability to act uniformly and determinedly to reach
that purpose. Exactly this view is strongly present in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s own
works, although of course with a positive evaluation of that will and purpose.
I will return to this comparison shortly, in the comparative analysis in the next
chapter.
As a conclusion to this analysis, I would like to elaborate on two of the points
mentioned above – the centrality of fixed qualities and the black-and-white world-
view – and also comment on the perceived difference between the authentically
Islamic and the deviations from it, since they all appear as central conceptual
building blocks in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s texts. Having outlined the general features
above, I turn now to a detailed analysis of how he construes the concept al-fikr
136 Islamist rhetoric
al-islm – Islamic thought – in the introduction to the book al-Nas
.s
. al-islm bayn
al-ijtihd wa-l-jumd wa-l-trkhiyya (The Islamic text between ijtihd, ossifica-
tion and historicity) (ÝImÁra 2000), since this analysis brings out the main points
in the previous discussion particularly well. I will then connect his discourse to
research on Islamist ideology generally as a preamble to the comparative analysis
in the next chapter.
al-Nas
.s
. al-islm bayn al-ijtihd wa-l-jumd wa-l-trkhiyya is partly a polemic,
and partly an exposition of what ÝImÁra calls the ‘Islamic method’ for interpreting
the Qur’an and sunna. The book is divided into two parts. First, he introduces two
ways of interpreting the text which he deems corrupt, namely the ‘literalist’ one
and the ‘positivist secularist’ one. The fault with the former is that its proponents
make no room for personal exegetical effort, or ijtihd, but blindly follow the
scripture’s letter and classical authorities. In this way, their Islamic exegesis has
come to a standstill (hence the reference to jumd in the book’s title). The pro-
ponents of the latter method take the idea of ijtihd much too far, and disregard
the scripture, the principles of the Arabic language and time-honoured exegetical
methods in order to justify their westernized ideas. He then criticizes the latter
method at some length. The remaining part of the book is used to describe a ‘cor-
rect’ way of interpreting the QurÞÁn and sunna, and here ÝImÁra draws on classi-
cal authorities and the QurÞÁn and sunna themselves to prove his points. For the
purposes of this analysis I will concentrate only on the introduction to the book,
which covers nine small pages of text.
The concept al-fikr al-Islm occurs only twice in the introduction, but at impor-
tant points in the text – at the beginning and the end.
The first sentence (p. 15) is:
In the relation of scripture to interpretation, Islamic thought has faced and still
faces – then and now – tendencies of extremism which have varied between
negligence and excess.
The second sentence (p. 22) is:
Thus, contemporary Islamic thought – the thought of the revivalist and renew-
ing trend – faces in the relation of scripture to interpretation these two kinds
of extremism: (...).

The rhetoric of religious polemics 137
When examining more closely the first sentence in terms of an ideational analysis,
we get the following table:
As an introduction to the analysis, let us recall Michael Halliday’s statement
about processes:
[T]he clause is also a mode of reflection, of imposing order on the endless var-
iation and flow of events. The grammatical system by which this is achieved
is that of TRANSITIVITY… The transitivity system construes the world of
experience into a manageable set of PROCESS TYPES. Each process type
provides its own model or schema for constructing a particular domain of
experience as a figure of a particular kind (...)
(Halliday 2004: 170)
According to Halliday, the choice of one process type instead of another for repre-
senting experience impinges on the meaning of a text. As Halliday himself points
out, deciding on which verbs belong in which category is sometimes very hard.
However, I think it is reasonable to describe the process in the above sentence as
a material one, involving Actor, Goal and Circumstance(s).
If we analyse the sentence above in terms of the grammatical choices made, it
acquires an interesting ideological import. MuÎammad ÝImÁra could have chosen
to present the relationship between Islamic thought and the tendencies he criti-
cizes differently, for example by employing a relational process – something along
the lines of ‘Islamic thought has included several tendencies of both negligence
and excess.’ Instead, he has chosen to present ‘Islamic thought’ as an entity that
‘faces’ several tendencies of negligence and excess. This implies, first, that the
excesses that MuÎammad ÝImÁra is about to present are not merely tendencies in
Islamic thought that he dislikes; instead, they are external to it, come from outside
and do not fall within its scope. In this way, he construes Islamic thought as devoid
of ambiguities or contradictions by default. In addition, the reader cannot fail to
Table 6.1
138 Islamist rhetoric
notice the implicit evaluation in this sentence: ‘Good’ (Islamic thought) versus
‘bad’ (tendencies of negligence and excess). Accordingly, Islamic thought is not
an objective category of investigation for ÝImÁra, but rather a theoretical or theo-
logical ideal he wants to preserve from corruption by external influences.
Second, the question of tense is interesting. He explicitly includes both the
imperfect and the perfect aspects of the verb wjaha (face). Taken together with
the external threats of negligence and excess it faces, this necessarily implies that,
in his view, ‘Islamic thought’ is essentially the same in the past and now. There is
a strong suggestion of continuity in the way he phrases this sentence.
Third, by making ‘Islamic thought’ the Actor in this sentence, MuÎammad
ÝImÁra casts it as an active agent (cf. the beginning of this section, where this was
treated as a general phenomenon in his texts). Islamic thought reacts to the chal-
lenges it faces instead of being acted on by them. This construal of events stands
in contrast to the way ÝImÁra presents his main goal of criticism, namely ‘secular’
Arab thinkers:
And today... after the philosophy of ‘Western – positivist, secular
Enlightenment’ has ‘filtered through’ to segments of the Arabic and Islamic
cultural elite, which have become westernized (...) Today, a group of our
westernized intellectuals approach the Islamic religious scripture in the same
way as the philosophers of the Western Enlightenment approached (...) the
religious scripture in Judaism and Christianity.
(ÝImÁra 2000: 16–17)
Here, outside forces are Actors and intellectual, ‘westernized’Arabs are Goals. In
other words, Islamic thought itself is not influenced by the ‘positivist’ and ‘secu-
lar’ philosophy, but some individuals have been led astray. All in all, when we
unpack the little sentence above, we are left with an impression of Islamic thought
as a seamless, continuous historical presence that is not influenced or manipulated
by external forces.
It is instructive to compare the conclusion above with Aziz Al-Azmeh’s analy-
sis of Islamist political ideology:
History takes place in two registers, one of which has a decided ontologi-
cal distinction over the other: the authentic, and the inauthentic; that of the
Islamic self, and that of its corruptions by otherness, such as a non-Islamic
people and religions, schisms, heresies and a manifold of enemies... In

principle impermeable, this ego is yet subject to degradation, which is of
necessity contingent and solely attributable to exotic ruses and snares: of
Manichean and Muslim schismatics in the Middle Ages, of Jews/Marxists/
Masons, allied to the evils of constitutionalism, Arab nationalism and other
universal political principles in modernity.
(Al-Azmeh 1996: 67–68)
This is not only Al-Azmeh’s view. The Islamist ideology’s preoccupation with
authenticity, the self and the ‘other’, and a more or less Manichaean world-view
is widely attested to by many scholars, e.g. Ayubi (1991), Choueiri (1997) and
DiyÁb (2002). ÝImÁra’s construal of Islamic thought confirms Al-Azmeh’s argu-
ment: authentic Islamic thought is in principle impermeable, but still subject to
threats from inauthentic schools of religious thought. These schools of thought
have come from the imperialist West and are adhered to by modern schismat-
ics. Therefore, ÝImÁra feels the need to write a pamphlet in which he refutes the
assailants of the unassailable tradition of Islamic thought.7
His language in these
excerpts makes his texts an archetypical example of the prevailing Islamic ideol-
ogy in Egypt, which we defined in Chapter 3.
The contradiction between the impermeable but still corrupted self is even more
apparent if we return to the analysis and take a look at the second sentence. Even
though it seems at first sight almost identical to the first sentence, some interesting
modifications are introduced in table 6.2.
MuÎammad ÝImÁra now writes about ‘contemporary’ Islamic thought, which is
further qualified as the thought of a ‘trend of revival and renewal’. If we unpack
the two noun phrases that make up the Actor, we find that ‘contemporary Islamic
thought’ equals ‘the thought of the revivalist and renewing trend’. The underly-
ing proposition in the second noun phrase would then be that ‘there exists a trend
in Islamic thought which revives and renews’. However, it is hard to say exactly
what this trend revives and renews. Is it Islamic societies or Islamic thought itself,
and, if the latter is the case, is it then classical Islamic thought it renews, since
this trend is described as representing ‘contemporary’ Islamic thought? In that
case, what has happened to classical Islamic thought, since it needs renewal? All
these questions are left unanswered, since they are not part of the argument of the
sentence, which concerns the relationship between Islamic thought and two kinds
Table 6.2
140 Islamist rhetoric
of extremism. Thus, by embedding the processes of revival and renewal in a noun
phrase, and by letting out the complement of the two verbal nouns – that which
needs revival and renewal – MuÎammad ÝImÁra achieves the rhetorical effect of
mystification, whereby potentially difficult or contested ideas are obscured, often
by using nominalization as a rhetorical tool (Hodge and Kress 1993: 15–38).8
The
parallel to his ideological use of cohesive devices is obvious. If MuÎammad ÝImÁra
thinks that Islamic thought has been corrupted, he does not acknowledge it openly,
but merely hints at the possibility that something might be wrong somewhere. At
the same time, he identifies his own ideological position with two concepts that
have a universally positive ring to them (revival and renewal), without specify-
ing what he means by them. The effect is that the integrity of ‘Islamic thought’ is
upheld despite the existence of (obscured) discordances within it.At the same time
the credibility of ÝImÁra’s own religious ideology is likely to be strengthened in the
mind of the reader without a single argument having yet been introduced, since he
associates it with revival and renewal.
Conclusion
There is ideology embedded in the lexical and syntactic choices MuÎammad ÝImÁra
makes, and, since some of them are embedded in the structure of the sentences, they
are not open to argument and thus forced on the reader implicitly. This ideology has
the following characteristics: Islamic thought is timeless, homogeneous and inher-
ently true and right. Accordingly, it must defend itself against corruptive external
influences, and ÝImÁra as a religious thinker is part of this defence. These assump-
tions, on which the argument of the whole book rests, are scarcely made explicit in
the text, but follow by necessity from the way ÝImÁra has moulded his sentences.
This is highly efficient rhetoric, since his basic premises are not presented as such,
but taken for granted. Therefore, the reader has to perform an act of conscious
distancing from the utterances in the text to be able to resist its argument.
Finally, it is necessary once again to look outside this small amount of text to
assess the validity of the analysis. By looking at MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s literary
output during the last fifteen years or so, it is possible to suggest that the analysis
above captures recurring ideas in his discourse that are at times made explicit and
at other times remain implicit. As one example, the book entitled al-Tafsr al-
mrkis li-l-islm (The Marxist interpretation of Islam) (ÝImÁra 1996) is a polemic
against the thinker NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd, who approaches the QurÞÁn with mod-
ern hermeneutical theories. The main thrust of this book is that such a method
represents a materialist ideology that is irreconcilable with the basic tenets of
Islam and sound Islamic theology. We have also seen that, in other works, ÝImÁra
argues for the existence of fundamental differences between a ‘secular’ West and
a ‘shar‘a-abiding’ Islamic world, making intellectual borrowing from the West a
futile or even dangerous enterprise (ÝImÁra 2003). The dominant idea is that of one
authentic, correct interpretation of Islam versus corrupted interpretations, as well
as all other world-views, be they religious or ideological. In the most recent publi-
cation studied here (ÝImÁra 2005), this idea is reiterated again and again, whether
The rhetoric of religious polemics 141
the subject is modernization, the position of women, or the relationship between
the Arab world and the West.
MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s preoccupation with active concepts, combined with his
black-and-white view of the world, leads to a discourse that does not sit well
with his self-professed and oft-stated intellectual openness. Interestingly, his dis-
course, in terms of its lack of concern for human agency, is almost diametrically
opposed to ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse, which combines the construal of his reader-
ship as important agents of Islam with a focus on practical work dedicated to
improve people’s lives and bring about mutual respect and understanding between
Muslims and non-Muslims. The fact that these two figures nevertheless share the
same epistemology, and that ÝImÁra’s texts are published on ÝAmr KhÁlid’s Web
site points to the possibility of crossing lines of convergence and divergence in the
Islamic field. We should therefore turn our attention to the Islamic field as a whole
and try to situate ÝAmr KhÁlid, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and MuÎammad ÝImÁra in it
based on the insights from the preceding analysis.

7 Rhetoric and religious
ideology
As stated in Chapter 1, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, ÝAmr KhÁlid and MuÎammad ÝImÁra
have a common goal: to support the ongoing Islamic awakening (s
.ah
.wa). However,
this ‘awakening’ and the correlate term ‘Islamism’ that describes its political
and social manifestations are not one-dimensional ones. This is reflected in
the texts we have analysed so far: the three writers’ approaches to the task of
supporting the s
.ah
.wa are very different from each other. Two likely reasons
for these differences are the roles they assume in the Islamic field and their
respective ways of persuading. MuÎammad ÝImÁra is an academic and intellectual,
while ÝAmr KhÁlid and YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ represent two very different kinds of
preachers who nevertheless share the practice of proselytizing. In the preceding
analyses, I have treated separately the questions of how these three writers con-
strue interpersonal relationships with their readers and how they construe images
of Islam. Now I will connect these questions to the writers’positions in the Islamic
field. The aim of this chapter is twofold: to show how their rhetorical choices
constitute them as individuals within distinct groups in the field, and to discuss
how they contribute to shaping ideological encounters within Egypt and on a
global scale.
According to this scheme, the textual evidence considered in the analyses can
be interpreted as contributing to differences along two axes that correspond to the
two aims above. The first axis has to do with how interpersonal and ideational
resources reflect and re-create differences between several discourse communi-
ties, which are all nevertheless within the scope of Islamism. The second is a
political axis, where the different kinds of rhetoric express religious ideologies
that have a bearing not only on the Egyptian Islamic field, but also on the question
about Islam and its ‘others’: the West and Arab secularism.
Rhetorical functions and rhetorical tools
The rhetorical differences between YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, ÝAmr KhÁlid and
MuÎammad ÝImÁra are connected to their different roles in the Islamic field. These
differences turn out to have relevance on two levels: practically, in how to account
for the pervasiveness of the Islamist discourse in Egypt, and theoretically, in how
to approach modern Arabic rhetoric as an object of study.
Rhetoric and religious ideology 143
Let us start with YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ. His rhetoric conforms to that of the
(authoritative) textbook: the prominent relational processes define Islamic belief
and practices for the religiously aware Muslim. This is backed up by the authority
of an easily recognizable intertextuality with classical Islamic literature. Nearly
all the footnotes in al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books are references to the QurÞÁn or the sunna,
and in the body text there are quotes of classical poetry and statements by classical
religious authorities such as Ibn Taymiyya, al-GhazÁlÐ and al-ÑuyÙÔÐ. In addition,
he puts great emphasis on his own personal authority through the way he refers
to himself and writes himself into the exposition of various subjects in his books
(recall his use of the first person singular, analysed in Chapter 4). In other words,
the metadiscourse in his books conveys both institutional and personal author-
ity. The quotations and references, especially those to hadiths, through which he
shows his learning by commenting on some, constitute explicit links to the reli-
gious establishment and the institutional authority of the ulama.
Perhaps it is the preoccupation with asserting his authority, combined with the
detached and restrained tone, that makes YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s style less than col-
ourful. In contrast to the language of both ÝAmr KhÁlid and MuÎammad ÝImÁra,
who use metadiscourse to make their texts lively and intense, al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s lan-
guage is as level-headed as he himself appears, despite his eloquence and usage of
time-honoured rhetorical devices such as various forms of rhyme and repetition of
near-synonyms. Another reason might be that there is little real discussion in his
texts.As we have seen, the most intense parts of MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s texts are often
where he drives home some point on which he perceives there to be contention.
There is little argumentation in this sense in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books. Instead,
the reader is offered explanations and references to classical authorities that are
taken at face value as eternal proofs of the correctness of al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s own views.
In addition, although known as a preacher, or d‘ya, as ÝAmr KhÁlid also is, he
keeps his distance from the reader, something which is apparent in both his use of
pronominal reference and the sparsity of questions and commands in his texts that
address the reader directly. Instead, as we have seen, he prefers to refer to the reader
indirectly through a generic third person singular (which is always masculine, by
the way, unlike in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts). Finally, Krämer’s judgement that, although
he talks much about action, he remains a man of words (Krämer 2006: 193) may be
extended to the very structure of his discourse. Even though he writes about action,
both the interpersonal and ideational aspects I have studied give a rather static qual-
ity to his texts, where definitions and delimitations are the most conspicuous ele-
ments. The result of all this in interpersonal terms is that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s texts
lack spiritual intensity; there is little recourse to pathos in his rhetoric, apart from
his usage of traditional rhetorical figures. He is an important religious teacher and
a forceful activist on behalf of the establishment of ulama, but he does not come
across as particularly inspiring. Instead, his rhetoric seems geared to enhancing his
ethos as an, or perhaps even the, doctrinal authority in Sunni Islam. This conclu-
sion fits nicely with his many activities in the religio-political sphere in the Islamic
world, and his enormous output of books that are given more to statements of what
is correct Islam than original and creative religious ideas.
144 Islamist rhetoric
As for ÝAmr KhÁlid, his rhetoric is the opposite of both YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s
and MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s, in different ways. Devoid of all but the most elementary
knowledge about Islamic religious tradition and theology, his discourse is all about
action and inspiration. ÝAmr KhÁlid and many of the other new preachers have
the charisma, but not the religious knowledge, that characterized earlier hugely
popular preachers such as shaykh Kishk and to an even greater extent MuÎammad
al-ShaÝrÁwÐ (Jansen 1986: 91–151). In the place of knowledge, he introduces a
new religious culture of intense feeling combined with a view of the believer as a
religious entrepreneur, hence the omnipresence of discoursal boosters like inter-
jections and the strong emphasis on the reader as an active agent in the physical
world. Accordingly, ÝAmr KhÁlid’s texts are distinguished by their almost extreme
reliance on pathos to persuade the reader to accept the message. We have seen this
in his use of pronouns to create intimacy and solidarity as well as the omnipres-
ence of exclamations. The many repetitions in KhÁlid’s texts are also part of his
reliance on pathos. We find repetition also in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books, but,
whereas the latter’s use of this tool conforms to classical Arabic aesthetic ideals
and thus serves an important poetic function, the repetitions in KhÁlid’s texts are
of a much cruder kind. Intensity, and not elegance, is the hallmark of his reliance
on pathos to persuade.
It is probably natural, considering this fact, that his discourse is very much
directed at individuals, whether alone or as part of groups. ÝAmr KhÁlid’s Islamic
reform starts from the level of personal feelings, in direct opposition to YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s focus on societal change, it would seem.
Accordingly, he construes his readers as active and dynamic believers. What
counts is the feeling that one does something for one’s faith and for oneself. While
ÝAmr KhÁlid conforms to the centrist message in doctrinal terms, his continuous
focus on the individual and his or her feelings is something new in Islamism, and
this is borne out on the level of form by KhÁlid’s novel and staccato style. It can
perhaps be described best as spoken language idiom pressed into the mould of fus
.
h
. grammar and vocabulary. To the extent that this style is imitated by others and
accepted and perhaps even adopted by their readership, it constitutes an inter-
esting linguistic phenomenon in itself. However, such questions are beyond the
scope of the present inquiry.
Lastly, MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s mode of writing leans more toward an academic
idiom than anything else. Although ethos is of course an inherent dimension of
every kind of persuasive discourse, this rhetorical resource is not as conspicuous
in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s texts as in YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwi’s. Neither does he place
much emphasis on pathos. Instead, ÝImÁra relies on logos to a great extent. His
books and articles are constructed around claims and ideas which he discusses at
length, drawing on various sources that are explicitly mentioned in the texts.YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ, on the other hand, is concerned to clarify issues without engaging
seriously with arguments that counter his own, and for the most part the sources
he draws on explicitly are the QurÞÁn and collections of hadith. Accordingly,
MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s style is more comparable to the popularized academic
literature that comes from both the ‘independent Islamists’ analysed by DiyÁb
Rhetoric and religious ideology 145
(2002) and liberal Muslim writers of different shades, such as NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ
Zayd, JamÁl al-BannÁ and Sayyid al-QimanÐ. In this sense, his reliance on logos of
course contributes to his ethos as an accomplished academic Islamic author. This
goes to show the extent to which ethos is a property of rhetoric that can be realized
in many ways, including through the other two main aspects of rhetoric as defined
by Aristotle. However, whereas for YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ a strong emphasis on his
ethos as a religious authority seems to be an end in itself, MuÎammad ÝImÁra is
genuinely concerned with arguments and discussion. His aggressive way of argu-
ing is another distinctive trait of his discourse that puts him at loggerheads with
other writers in the same genre. A more detailed comparison between the different
kinds of arguing among the lay intellectuals will follow shortly, but here it is suf-
ficient to note how MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s membership in this discourse community
explains the distinctive way in which he approaches the reader, constructs author-
ity and construes Islam, as compared to YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and ÝAmr KhÁlid. As
we saw in the previous chapter, his use of personal reference betrays less interest
in creating overt ties between reader and writer than is the case for either YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ or ÝAmr KhÁlid. Instead, his discourse is full of ideas and big entities,
such as civilizations, as active agents in the world. He is clearly more concerned
with forefronting the issues he discusses than focusing on the relationship with
his readers. As for the mood structures we have analysed, they also appeal to the
reader’s reasoning in a sometimes manipulative way, so they can be regarded as
being part of the logos repertoire in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s texts. In this they are
different from ÝAmr KhÁlid’s questions and commands, which are clearly meant
to affect the reader’s feelings, not his/her rational reasoning. The long adverbials
and relative sentences that we also saw to be prominent in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s
texts serve the function of assisting the reader in processing the argument, which
is also connected to logos. At the same time, these repetitions of the argument and
the questions as well as the ideational aspects of his discourse have already been
shown to have important ideological implications, which I will return to in the
next section.
So far, we can conclude that, put schematically, we have three authors who cre-
ate very different roles for themselves and their readers and thus produce images of
Islam that are different to a smaller or greater degree. Consequently, they employ
very diverse tools of persuasion. While for YÙÒuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ his ethos as a lead-
ing religious scholar seems central, MuÎammad ÝImÁra relies most visibly on
logos to persuade his readers, and ÝAmr KhÁlid’s message is based almost entirely
on emotional appeal, or pathos. They thus spread out quite evenly in relation to
the rhetorical dimensions outlined in Aristotelian rhetoric. However, at the same
time there is a glaring contrast between YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and MuÎammad
ÝImÁra’s conventional styles on the one hand and ÝAmr KhÁlid’s unconventional
and extremely expressive style on the other. It is interesting that the pattern seems
to be the same when they use other media. In their TV appearances, the linguistic
as well as the stylistic (in terms of body language and behaviour in the studio)
differences correspond to those in their writing. The scope of this study does not
allow us to take the comparison further than that, though, and other studies are
146 Islamist rhetoric
required to deal with the question of live appearances, including the additional
issues about multimodality and media production that would need to be taken into
consideration.
There is, however, one question that is highly relevant and that seems pressing,
considering the gap between the rhetoric and style of ÝAmr KhÁlid and the two
other figures, as well as the controversies around the new preachers, namely: is this
new religious culture in conflict with the top-down Islamic awakening that YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ propagates and/or the polemic brand of centrism that MuÎammad
ÝImÁra represents? If so, what kind of conflict are we talking about? Are the differ-
ences there on the surface only, or are there real ideological issues at stake? I will
turn to these important questions shortly.
First, however, I would like to connect the analysis of these three discourses
to current theory about Arabic rhetoric. In her acclaimed study about repetition
in Arabic persuasive discourse, Barbara Johnstone claims that Arabic persuasive
texts are characterized by repetition on all linguistic levels. The conclusion she
draws from this is that
[p]ersuasion is a result as much, or more, of the sheer number of times an idea
is stated and the balanced, elaborate ways in which it is stated than a result
of syllogistic or enthymematic ‘logical’ organization. The discourse is highly
paratactic and polysyndetic: ideas flow horizontally into one another.
(Johnstone 1991: 108)
And by extension, she claims,
Arabic argumentation is structured by the notion that is is [sic] the presentation
of an idea – the linguistic forms and the very words that are used to describe
it – that is persuasive, not the logical structure of proof which Westerners see
behind the words.
(Ibid.: 117)
Based on the hypothesis that paradigmatic patterning seems to be a ‘basic rhe-
torical strategy’ in Arabic discourse, Johnstone speculates that it is called for in
part by ‘the structure of society’, which is hierarchical and undemocratic (Ibid.:
109, 113).
While the actual analysis that Johnstone presents is very stimulating, she makes
claims that seem too grand. To begin with, they may be contradicted by simply
looking at other persuasive texts than the ones she has based her analysis on. Of
the three authors studied in the present book, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and MuÎammad
ÝImÁra write persuasive texts that are clearly argumentative, and, even though rep-
etition of various kinds is undoubtedly part of their rhetoric, especially in the case
of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, other persuasive tools seem to be equally important. At the
very least, the repetition in their texts cannot be said to be a substitute for argu-
ment, as Johnstone claims, since they both present coherent and long arguments
in chapter after chapter. (I do, however, agree that repetition can be one way of
Rhetoric and religious ideology 147
arguing, which is Johnstone’s weaker claim.) The quality of these arguments can
be discussed, but there is no question about their presence in the texts. In other
words, the claim that ‘Arabic argumentation is structured by the notion that it is
the presentation of an idea that is persuasive’ is flatly contradicted by the texts in
this study. In addition, both classical Arabic rhetorical theory and modern Arabic
argumentation exhibit awareness and use of different argumentative strategies, as
argued by Hatim (1991), a fact that also serves to question Johnstone’s exclusive
focus on repetition as the dominant mode of arguing in Arabic.1
One reason that Johnstone reaches the conclusions she does might be that she
combines a very small corpus of texts with little consideration of the nature of
these texts, apart from the designation of them as ‘persuasive’ or ‘argumentative’.
Not surprisingly, the results of the present analysis suggest that, just as in other
cultures, Arabic rhetoric differs widely according to what discourse community
the writer belongs to, and what genre s/he writes within, issues that do not figure in
Johnstone’s analysis. Accordingly, sweeping generalizations that conclude from a
small number of texts to a supposedly uniform Arabic rhetorical idiom, followed
by hypotheses about rhetoric and society at large, are risky at best and misleading
at worst.
This is not to deny the usefulness of identifying repetition as an important prop-
erty ofArabic discourse that might or might not be considered as one of its general
features (it is hard to tell, considering the small corpus used by Johnstone). And,
as I have hopefully succeeded in making clear already, the present study is based
on the same fundamental assumption as Johnstone’s: that one can say something
about society by analysing properties of the languages and/or discourses found
in it. There is, in other words, a theoretical and methodological challenge to be
addressed here. I think the crucial point is the level of universality one operates
with. If the focus is on general features of a language and not just a particular dis-
course, the risk of getting it wrong is very high if one tries to connect these features
directly to ‘society’, because such an attempt presupposes a simplistic approach
to both society and language. They are both highly diverse entities, and positing
them as two transparent objects of study that can throw light on each other just
like that is basically to restate the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis in its strongest ver-
sion. Instead, a useful and rewarding strategy may be to keep the analysis within
the scope of linguistics, for example with comparative analyses, as David Justice
has done in his study of Arabic and various European languages (Justice 1987).
Tellingly, Justice succeeds in dispelling some quasi-sociological myths about the
Arabic language through his comparative study. If the aim of a particular dis-
course analysis is to explicate connections between discourse and society, I would
argue that both are so complex that only local analyses based on a thorough con-
ceptualization of both discourse and society are viable. This allows for an analysis
that takes into account such parameters as individual rhetorical choices, genre,
discourse community and socio-religious groups, thus giving room for comments
that pertain to the socio-religious and political implications of the discourses stud-
ied. It does not allow for generalizing about all Arabs and their way of writing,
however.
148 Islamist rhetoric
Rhetoric and ideology in the Islamic field
With this theoretical and methodological note of caution in mind, it is still possible
to say something about how these discourses relate to ideological currents and
tensions not only within the Arab world but also internationally. The two levels
tend to intertwine, so the easiest way of discussing them is to treat each writer
individually, while keeping in mind that they can be seen as representatives of
specific discourse communities.
Ysuf al-Qarad
.w
Although YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is no stranger to polemical attacks on liberal Arabs
and the Western world, this kind of ideological conflict is not the most charac-
teristic feature of his discourse, despite some European media’s depiction of
him as a firebrand cleric. Bearing in mind the comments about his texts above
(p. 143), I would argue that the most important ideological significance of his
discourse is that it aims at asserting the position of the ulama as the ultimate
religious authorities in Islam, and that this effort takes place in a globalized
Islamic culture that is often described as being characterized by fragmentation
of religious authority (cf. Chapter 3). In Chapter 4 it was also mentioned that
the ulama have been able to revitalize their position in the religious field in the
1980s and 1990s. In Malika Zeghal’s words, some of them ‘are crucial political
actors whose aim is to enlarge – in various ways – their own sphere of inter-
vention’ (Zeghal 1999: 396). Analytical comments aside, it is abundantly clear
that the ulama themselves disapprove of the many new voices in the Islamic
public sphere. For example, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ has spoken rather dismissively
of ÝAmr KhÁlid, referring specifically to his lack of qualifications for preaching
(Schleifer 2004). In a related move, the Academy of Islamic Research (MajmaÝ
al-buÎÙth al-islÁmiyya) of al-Azhar recently tried to restrict the authority to
issue fatwas to the DÁr al-iftÁÞ, citing the danger of every Tom, Dick and Harry
assuming authority to speak on religious issues as a consequence of the growing
importance of satellite television (al-BuÎayrÐ 2007).
While such examples seem to prove Eickelman and Piscatori (1996: 131–135)
correct in claiming that fragmentation of authority is a characteristic feature of
contemporary Islam, the effortless display of authority that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s
language exhibits hints at another development that might unfold in contrast to the
fragmentation described by them. Considering these comments about the power
relations in the religious field, what conclusions can be drawn about the role of
al-QaraÃÁwÐ, based on the rhetoric of his texts?
First of all, we actually do not need to go as far as his rhetoric to establish that he
does play a major role. YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is arguably the most active and visible
figure in the ulama’s struggle to achieve more influence over the public sphere and
the lives of ordinary Muslims. This is witnessed by his instrumental role in setting
up international organizations of Islamic scholars that issue fatwas and state the
position of Islam on a number of social and political questions. The very successful
Rhetoric and religious ideology 149
Web site Islam Online and the European Council for Fatwa and Research are just
two examples. Through these activities and his regular media appearances he has
contributed strongly to reintroducing religious scholars as relevant figures in con-
temporary, global Islam.
Considering YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s rhetoric, Zaman’s (2002) epithet about con-
temporary ulama, ‘custodians of change’, is very apt to describe his role. The
word ‘custodians’ in particular seems interesting to me. As we have seen, both
the interpersonal and the ideational aspects of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s discourse are
geared to enhancing the authority of centrist Islamic religious scholars generally
and himself in particular. Whether it is stated explicitly or as part of the metadis-
course, the message that is repeated throughout his books is ‘leave the thinking
to the centrist experts, and follow their advice in order to achieve a rightly guided
Islamic awakening’. This is coupled with a sometimes rather stilted style that
draws on classical poetry and rhetorical figures such as rhythm, end-rhyme and
alliteration, features suggesting a certain dignity that befits a custodian of a 1,400-
year-long religious tradition. The interesting fact is that the weightiness of the
style does not correspond to the content. As I commented in Chapter 5, his books
are hardly intellectually stimulating, but rather repetitive and superficial. There
are no real discussions anywhere, whether about epistemology or difficulties of
putting theory into practice, for example. Instead, one reads again and again about
the virtues of the Islamic middle road in various aspects of public and private life,
complete with long and elaborate examples from Islamic history.
Are YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s impersonal, somewhat pompous style, his preoc-
cupation with personal and institutional authority, and the relative simplicity of
his books representative of popularizing books by the ulama generally? There
is not space enough here to consider this question in a comprehensive way, but
a comparison with the books of two other religious scholars of high stature sug-
gests that the answer is both yes and no. The late MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ, whom
al-QaraÃÁwÐ acknowledges as a teacher and inspiration, was also an accom-
plished religious scholar who used to front the Islamists against the secularists, as
witnessed in the great debate between the two groups at the Cairo book fair in
1992 (see p. 34). He shared the ideology of centrism, and was beloved by the
people. He also wrote a number of books, and is thus eminently comparable to
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ. Two of these are Turthun al-fikr f mzn al-shar‘ wa-l-
‘aql (Our philosophical heritage considered in light of religious law and reason)
(2003) and Laysa min al-islm (This is not of Islam) (1998), which were both pub-
lished by DÁr al-shurÙq, the same publishing house that publishes al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s
books. They are comparable in the issues they take up, both being clearly aimed
at the general reader. The second scholar I would like to consider is the late shaykh
of al-Azhar, MuÎammad Sayyid ÓanÔÁwÐ, who wrote al-Ish‘t al-kdhiba wa-kayf
h
.rabah al-islm (False rumours, and how Islam fought them) (2001), also pub-
lished by DÁr al-shurÙq, and also ostensibly meant for the general reader. While
being widely regarded as subservient to the regime and thus lacking politico-religious
credibility, ÓanÔÁwÐ was an undisputedly learned religious scholar, and had an
interest in maintaining the prestige of al-Azhar and the religious establishment
150 Islamist rhetoric
generally. All three books are normative in content, describing what is correct and
proper Islamic practice in contemporary society and criticizing deviations from
this path based on orthodox dogma and sources. These books then should be good
grounds for comparison with YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s writings. It should be admitted
at once that I have not looked at enough books to be able to draw any firm conclu-
sions; there might well be significant rhetorical differences between the books of
each author, and so this excursion is meant more as an indication than anything
else. Still, it is an interesting indication, since the books are quite similar in layout,
organization and probably also the intended readership.
Starting with the content of MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ’s books, he does not hesi-
tate to plunge into classifications of classical tafsr and their relevance for today’s
Muslims, in the context of a discussion about how to relate to the classical reli-
gious heritage (al-GhazÁlÐ 2003: 123–143). In another chapter, he presents the
great Islamic thinker and mysticist Ibn ÝArabÐ’s view on the QurÞÁn in detail, before
he proceeds to refute and discard his thought in a very aggressive way. Such seri-
ous and critical engagement with the religious heritage is rarely seen in YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s books, which are much more lightweight than this. Furthermore,
it is striking that, whereas al-QaraÃÁwÐ adopts a solemn and impersonal style to
present often trivial propositions and arguments, the exact opposite is the case
in MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ’s books. Consider the following passage, which is a
personal narrative that introduces a discussion about how unimportant it is to
speculate about issues such as anthropomorphism in light of the pressing issues of
today in Islam. As we have seen, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ also relies on such personal
narratives to emphasize his authority. The effect in MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ’s case
is rather different:
I was preoccupied by a number of serious issues; I prayed to my Lord in a
whisper full of hope, and I was certain that God listened to me! Moreover, I
felt that, if there was another person who did the same as me a billion light
years away, God would hear him, too!

Rhetoric and religious ideology 151
Distances of time and space do not mean anything to Him, blessed be His
name. Thus, nothing escapes his attention, whether it is on earth or in heaven.
‘Lo! my Lord is nigh, responsive.’
But suddenly an obtrusive question stirred inside me: is He close in His
essence or in his attributes?
This pretentious question is the result of the great amount of studies and
reading that I and others like me have put our minds to in our lives!
(al-GhazÁlÐ 2003: 45)
Unlike YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s narratives, this is not designed to show the authority
and wisdom of MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ. Instead, he invites the reader to join him
in some very personal reflections, where he does not shy away from question-
ing his own thoughts or relating his personal comfort in God’s omnipresence.
The intimate character of these paragraphs can be seen from the emphasis on
feelings, shown both in the choice of words (‘a whisper full of hope’) and in the
kinds of processes (the emotive processes here are ‘to be sure of’ and ‘to feel’,
with MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ as the Senser). Such passages are very frequent in
this book, and they correspond to his frequent references to himself in the
first person singular and the reader in the second person singular. The use of
punctuation, with many question marks and exclamation marks, is also charac-
teristic of his texts. This is in fact one of the primary characteristics of the book
Laysa min al-Islm, which is in other respects less personal than Turthun
al-fikr and more similar to YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s style. Generally, and in con-
trast to the texts of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, who keeps his distance from the reader,
MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ’s texts are personal, characterized by a lively and
impulsive style that is reminiscent of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s. However, just like YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ, MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ is totally confident in his use of fus
.h
.,
and he uses with the same natural elegance as the former poetic tools such as
rhyme, rhythm and quotations of classical Islamic poetry on a number of
occasions. His style is unmistakably that of the learned religious scholar, but it
is less pompous and more directly addressed to the reader than YÙsuf al-
QaraÃÁwÐ’s.
MuÎammad Sayyid ÓanÔÁwÐ, on the other hand, exhibits a style that is closer
to YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s, but is still less personal. His book is a lengthy exposi-
tion of the lies God’s prophets have faced about their message and themselves,
from Noah to MuÎammad, all based on the narratives in the QurÞÁn and sunna.
The point of the book is to show how wisely and meekly the prophets faced these
threats, and to establish a list of good responses to defamation of Islam. Though
ostensibly intended to support today’s Muslims, the examples of lies and rumours
stop at the earliest period of Islam and are strictly confined to what the QurÞÁn and
sunna relate about such incidents, so there is no reference to contemporary condi-
tions, in contrast to the books by Islamist religious scholars. ÓanÔÁwÐ’s erudition
is obvious from every section, but there are fewer rhetorical effects. Consider the
following passage, where he introduces one of the ways in which Muslims can
face and overcome slander and false rumours:
152 Islamist rhetoric
The question now is how did Islam fight against these rumours? And what
means did it use to instil the virtue of confidence in individuals and groups so
that the good could spread among people?
Among the most important means the Islamic shar‘a used to fight against
false rumours was that it established the correctness of what was said and
heard. This is because one of the characteristics of rational people is that they
ascertain that things are correct and scrutinize them judiciously. They make
sure that they are correct before judging in them. As for those who rely on
rash judgements and believe whatever is told them without verifying it, they
make errors that harm them instead of helping them.
He who ponders the glorious QurÞÁn finds that many of its verses exhort
people to ascertain that what they say and hear from others is correct, and that
what they read in others’ holy texts as well as what is talked about among
them is truthful.
(ÓanÔÁwÐ 2001: 187–188)
MuÎammad Sayyid ÓanÔÁwÐ’s style is different from bothYÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and
MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ’s. The writer in his books disappears almost completely,
becoming nothing more than a dispassionate guide to how others (the QurÞÁn,
prophets, great ulama) have approached the problem of lies and false rumours
about Islam and its teachings. He holds them up as examples to the reader, and his
own voice when he glosses QurÞÁnic verses or explains the meaning of a passage
is rarely accompanied by references to either himself or the reader. As here, he
relies on the third person instead. The only thing in this book that could be seen
as a self-conscious construal of an ethos as a learned scholar and spiritual guide is
his signature as ‘shaykh of al-Azhar’ at the end. Apparently, it is his institutional

Rhetoric and religious ideology 153
belonging and reliance on classical Islamic sources that are meant to secure the
authority of his words. The result of this showing and telling is a bland and dry
style. At the same time, however, ÓanÔÁwÐ shows his command of the classical
Arabic language, just like YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ, and
frequently quotes pieces of poetry to emphasize his points or employs repetition
of near-synonyms for emphatic effect.
Judging from this short comparison, one thing that seems pretty clear is that
despite some common traits there is great stylistic variation within the idiom of the
Azhar-educated religious scholars. Each of these three writers distinguishes him-
self in different ways, from the lively and personal to the bland and impersonal.
Returning to the main subject of the comparison, on this background it seems
safe to say that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s self-conscious emphasis on personal cha-
risma (the dignified, learned shaykh who rectifies the faults of his colleagues and
asserts his right to guide the Islamic awakening) and institutional authority (the
references to the privileges of ‘experts’ and the intertextuality with prestigious
religious literature) is a distinctive feature of his rhetoric, and it gives the impres-
sion that, for YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, religious authority is an end in itself and one that
can be distinguished from his project of supporting a centrist Islamic awakening.
This authority props up his activity as a prolific issuer of fatwas, which is a way of
defining Islam that demands very little argument, but rests instead on the acknowl-
edged authority of the issuer. A reference to Bourdieu’s thought on language, reli-
gion and authority would seem in order here:
The symbolic efficacy of words is exercised only in so far as the person sub-
jected to it recognizes the person who exercises it as authorized to do so, or,
what amounts to the same thing, only in so far as he fails to realize that, in
submitting to it, he himself has contributed, through his recognition, to its
establishment.
(Bourdieu 1992: 116)
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s language contributes to making his authority seem a recog-
nized fact, at the cost of other agents in the religious field. This rhetorical function
props up his dominant position in two respects: that of being one of the foremost
spokesmen of a religious ideology, centrism, which is becoming more and more
dominant in Egypt, and that of his position as a prominent member of a religious
establishment that jealously guards its power to speak in the name of religion.
What do these observations imply with regard to the fragmentation of authority
thesis? At the very least, the considerable success with which YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ
has played his rhetorical hand, combined of course with his religio-political acu-
men, goes to show that there can be no talk of anarchy in the religious field. Instead,
by emphasizing the importance of their religious assets, ulama who manage to
stay tuned to the trends in society can enhance their standing and importance as
religious authorities. YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ would thus constitute a very good exam-
ple of Zaman’s statement about the authority of the contemporary ulama: ‘[I]t is
precisely their claims to authoritatively represent an “authentic” Islamic tradition
154 Islamist rhetoric
in its richness, depth, and continuity that may have become the most significant
basis of their new prominence in the public sphere’ (Zaman 2002: 180). In other
words, ulama like YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ have succeeded in connecting the notion of
orthodoxy, which was mentioned in Chapter 1, with Islamism and current Islamic
practices. The results of this development are increasingly visible in the media as
well as in the streets in Egypt; as for the position of the ulama, it serves to enhance
their public role as the final arbiters in all things connected to Islam.
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ seems to provide a unique example of how powerful the
discourse of the religious professional can become. Two developments support
such a statement. First, considering the upsurge in fatwa-seeking in both the Arab
world and Europe in recent years, al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s construal of himself as a central
religious authority in Islam is of no little significance. The Norwegian weekly
magazine A-magasinet brought out a report (8 June 2007) about the European
Council for Fatwa and Research, where YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s authority as leader
of the council was emphasized, with a photo showing the other and more junior
members of the council kissing him as a sign of respect and affection. Although
the article states that there are scholars in the council who tend to disagree with
him, it is difficult to avoid comparing the scene and the whole situation with
the Vatican and its hierarchy of priests: religious experts from various countries
under the leadership of one undisputed authority treating all sorts of questions
pertaining to human life in closed discussions, and then issuing fatwas about these
questions with answers and judgements that define correct Islam for the laity. The
big difference between the Vatican’s authority and the organizations that YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ heads is of course that the former’s absolute authority is a matter
of doctrine, whereas the latter’s is not. Indeed, to be fair, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ has
never claimed any kind of absolute authority for himself alone, and the thought
would probably be reprehensible to him. However, this difference on principle
does not detract from the ideological importance of al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s efforts at secur-
ing the position of Islamic religious scholars (and himself in particular) as supreme
religious authorities.
Second, a religio-political development that caused a bit of a stir in 2007 was
the release of a draft political programme by the Muslim Brotherhood in which
one of the controversial points was their proposal for establishing a council of
religious professionals to oversee that laws and regulations are in concordance
with Islamic teaching (Muslim Brotherhood 2007, chapter 1, part 3). Considering
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s close relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood, it is dif-
ficult not to regard this point in their programme as a victory for his insistence on
the leading role the ulama should have in the Islamic revival.
Both the international boards of Islamic jurists which al-QaraÃÁwÐ is such an
important part of and the inclusion of a committee of religious scholars in the
Muslim Brotherhood’s political programme prove the extent to which the words of
the ulama have achieved a recognized symbolic efficacy, to use Bourdieu’s terms.
The implications of this fact are important and have to do with a serious ideologi-
cal struggle in Islam which has been part of its religious sociology for a long time.
Let me expand briefly on this claim. In contemporary Islam some thinkers want
Rhetoric and religious ideology 155
greater freedom for the individual believers to understand and interpret religion on
their own terms. They are proponents of various theological opinions, and some of
the most visible in Egypt are NaÒr ÍÁmidAbÙ Zayd and JamÁl al-BannÁ.Although
the former is more heterodox and also more intellectually sophisticated than the
latter, they both subscribe to an approach to the holy texts that is very close to what
has been termed an Islamic theology of liberation (see Esack 1997 for this term;
again, the parallel to Catholicism is obvious.) The point here is that, when the
religious experts effectively deny other than those educated at Islamic centres of
learning the possibility of interpreting Islam, the potential for interpretive freedom
is severely restricted and, in addition, the religious field becomes more vulnerable
to political manipulation.
The most vocal proponent of this critique has been NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd, and
his comments about the religious establishment obviously target exactly the kind
of practice that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ exercises. In an incisive critique of al-GhazÁlÐ
(d. 1111) and the religious establishment after him, NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd claims
that, in the interest of first the ÑÙfis and then the religious establishment generally,
al-GhazÁlÐ set up a divide between the elite and the common people (‘mma and
khs
.s
.a), where only the elite could really understand God’s word. This secured
their monopoly of power in the religious field, and laid the path for a collabora-
tion between the political and religious authorities in society (AbÙ Zayd 2000:
283–297). Today, NaÒr ÍÁmid AbÙ Zayd writes, the religious establishment is
still concerned to make the QurÞÁn an object of worship instead of an object of
interpretation for the laity (thus altering the concept of scripture, hence the book’s
title: Mafhm al-nas
.s
. (The concept of scripture)), in order to use the holy text as a
device for promoting their own agendas, whether they are loyal to corrupt regimes
or oppositional Islamist movements. The result is a reactionary religious and polit-
ical culture (ibid.: 11–12). YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, with the combination of religious
elitism and conservative Islamism he propagates, could be seen as a modern-day
al-GhazÁlÐ, writing books to the laity about how to behave in an islamically correct
way in all details of life, while restricting religious speculation to a small group
of experts. In this picture, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s explicit references to ‘al-ns’, the
common people, fit in nicely.
To conclude, it seems that, notwithstanding his quarrels with many conserva-
tive and quietist ulama, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ not only remains true to a professional
solidarity among the ulama, but in addition designs his discourse to enhance their
authority as religious experts. In fact, he acts as a promoter not only of centrism,
but also of a religious hierarchy that he and others frequently deny the existence
of (recall the oft-heard phrase ‘there is no clergy in Islam’).2
This is a separate
project from the ideological struggle to spread centrism, and distinguishes YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ from other Islamists, whether they are affiliated with the Muslim
Brotherhood or independent ones. It is within this framework that his different
treatment of conservative ulama and liberal Islamic thinkers must be seen. He crit-
icizes the former heavily, but never vilifies them. However, he has only scorn left
for the lay liberals, who are no less sincere in their attempts at interpreting the holy
texts than the ulama are. Consider the following two harangues about liberals:
156 Islamist rhetoric
But we warn against the danger posed by the permanent call for changing
Islamic religious discourse, especially at the present time. Not least, [we warn
against] the dubious writers who do not care about either religion or its adher-
ents, and whose intellectual and practical life has no room for God or eternity.
They are not concerned about God’s pleasure with them or his wrath, but they
take all the more care that they please their American master, so that he treats
them with some of his blessings and favours!
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 2004: 11)
As for the pretenders to ijtihd, who display nothing but insolence in regard
to the texts, a disregard for the sources [of religious science] and imposture
[ityn al-buyt min ghayr abwbih], they have to be rejected. [This must be
done] in order to defend the sanctity of religion and the shar‘a, so that they
are not used as a means to achieve fame, satisfy some hidden desire, support
corrupt authorities, or justify deviant practices and imported thoughts.
(al-QaraÃÁwÐ 1998: 106)
The liberals lose on two fronts: they do not share YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s ideology,
and they are not Azharites or theologians with a similar educational background.
Such people are simply not worthy dialogue partners for al-QaraÃÁwÐ. As the
transitivity analysis in Chapter 5 shows, this attitude becomes clear by the way he
represents processes and participants. Comparing him with MuÎammad ÝImÁra,
we could say that, whereas the latter engages in the conflict between liberals and
conservatives, East and West, the former has no interest in this conflict at all,
because the would-be interlocutors do not in his view possess the necessary quali-
fications for him to bother about talking seriously with them.

Rhetoric and religious ideology 157
Amr Khlid
What is the role of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse in the struggle between those who
want to empower the laity and the religious authorities that oppose these efforts?
Does his personal and action-oriented preaching have liberating potential for the
laity? And how does his discourse contribute to shaping relations with liberals and
the European ‘other’, if it contributes at all?
I argued above that ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse is intensely personal and action-
oriented. One way in which this translates into the religious field is through what
Patrick Haenni calls an Islamic Kulturkampf. Let me repeat a passage quoted in
Chapter 3:
[S]ur fond de théologie de prospérité musulmane et de différenciation bour-
geoise, un nouveau réformisme se construit qui abandonne les institutions
pour les mentalités et substitue à la lutte politique une guerre culturelle fondée
sur les valeurs de la culture d’entreprise.
(Haenni 2005: 67)
This quotation invites two questions, one pertaining to the religious establish-
ment and the other to traditional, political Islamism as represented by the Muslim
Brotherhood. Let us start with the relationship between the new preachers and
the religious establishment. When Haenni mentions the abandonment of institu-
tions, it seems natural to interpret him as meaning the religious establishment and
the official religious institution in Egypt (al-Azhar, DÁr al-iftÁÞ and the Ministry
of Religious Endowments). Are the discourses of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and ÝAmr
KhÁlid, of the ulama and the new preachers, therefore in conflict with each other?
This view has won some acceptance among scholars, perhaps as a consequence
of the emphasis in recent years on the fragmentation of religious authority in the
Islamic world in recent decades (see the previous section). As I noted in the previ-
ous section, the difference between a top-down and a bottom-up attitude to reli-
gious revival that is witnessed in the discourses under consideration here also
makes it natural to ask this question.
Acrucial element in this connection that has not been given sufficient attention is
the relation between form and content in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse. I think it is true,
as Iranian sociologist Asef Bayat states (2003), that there is nothing new, doctri-
nally speaking, in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse. His books are full of trivialities. They
are all about form, and as long as he does not go out of bounds doctrinally speak-
ing he is tolerated by the ulama. (In contrast, as we saw above, al-Azhar recently
moved to monopolize the issuing of fatwas to hinder a development where TV
preachers of sometimes dubious academic quality are able to issue fatwas accord-
ing to their own whims – see al-BuÎayrÐ 2007). There seems to be no imminent
danger of ÝAmr KhÁlid or any other lay new preacher crossing boundaries and
usurping spiritual authority, because everyone recognizes that they, the political
Islamists, the intellectual Islamists and the ulama all play distinct roles that are to
a great extent based on different forms of capital. The religious capital that ÝAmr
KhÁlid has got cannot be anything other than derived according to the extent to
158 Islamist rhetoric
which he subordinates himself to those who control this capital – the religious
experts. On the other hand, ÝAmr KhÁlid possesses a new kind of symbolic capital
in the Islamic field: a combination of personal charisma based on intimacy and
friendship and a close acquaintance with a new and global religious discourse that
focuses on the individual and his/her inner spiritual life, accompanied by elements
of pop culture, such as music and commercials, to reinforce this focus. The link
to music is shown in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s collaboration with Islamic pop phenomenon
Sami Yusuf. Yusuf, a Briton of Azerbaijani origin, has had a spectacular success
across the Muslim world with his Islamic pop music, and has appeared on several
TV programmes and live shows hosted by ÝAmr KhÁlid. As for the commercials,
the link is found in the metadiscourse in his books. The mood structures, with the
frequent use of questions, imperatives and exclamations, and the combination of
reader mention and inclusive ‘we’ are typical of advertisements (Thompson and
Thetela 1995).
Thus, the relationship between the religious establishment and the new preach-
ers is a complementary one rather than a conflicting one. In relation to the reli-
gious establishment, the function of the new preachers is to attract new groups to
become religiously aware, groups that the less explicitly interpersonally designed
discourses of Islamists, religious intellectuals and the ulama do not reach. In addi-
tion, the new preaching instils those who are already religiously aware with an
enthusiasm and spiritual intensity that the other groups cannot provide. It also
seems that from the perspective of the public the relationship between popu-
lar ulama and at least the most famous representatives of the new preachers is
interpreted in this way. I experienced this myself while doing fieldwork in Cairo.
When I tried to make contrastive comparisons between ÝAmr KhÁlid and YÙsuf
al-QaraÃÁwÐ my interlocutors would protest: ‘But you can’t compare them – they
represent two completely different things!’ Their point was that ÝAmr KhÁlid and
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ wrote in different genres: the former keeps only to raq’iq
literature (mild or soft preaching), and the latter produces works of religious guid-
ance and studies, both general and specialized ones. While I do think the two can
and should be compared, I gradually understood that conducting a comparison in
terms of opposition is fruitless. I got the understanding that, rather than talking
about the replacement of one ideology for another, we can talk about the addition
of one more voice to the spectrum of Islamist voices in Egypt that relate to the
others in various ways, and not necessarily antagonistic ones. Notwithstanding
YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s reservations about ÝAmr KhÁlid (Schleifer 2004), the peo-
ple I spoke with happily acknowledged that they read and listened to both. They
filled two different needs. The new preachers provide people, and especially the
youth, with ways to realize their personal spirituality, and they are more in tune
with the globalized and commercialized culture that surrounds them every day
and everywhere, not least through television and the Internet. As a lay person with
aspirations in the religious field, ÝAmr KhÁlid has to seek influence by something
other than theological authority, and his strategy is to cooperate with and befriend
his reader instead of instructing him/her. This cooperation is intensely personal
and takes place outside the framework of traditional religious rhetoric, to which
Rhetoric and religious ideology 159
ÝAmr KhÁlid is a stranger. Consequently, we can say that ÝAmr KhÁlid does bring
something qualitatively new into the Islamic field, but this does not necessarily
make him a subversive agent in the field, at least not as long as it is only the form
of his message that is radically new.
There is actually an intriguing historical parallel to be made here. This comple-
mentarity between lay preachers and religious professionals is not new. Writing
about the changing public sphere in the Arab and Islamic world, Salvatore and
Eickelman mention the rise to fame of the medical doctor MuÒÔafÁ MaÎmÙd as an
Islamic preacher in Egypt in the 1970s and 1980s (his mosque in al-MuhandisÐn is
still a stronghold of mainstream Islamism). One excerpt is worth quoting at length
on account of the striking resemblance to the situation described in this study:
Mahmud’s rapid rise in popularity did not represent the ascendancy of ‘lay’
religious authority over that of the Ýulama. His ascent and the crucial support
he received from the Shaykh al-Azhar of the time, ÝAbd al-Halim Mahmud,
shows how much he still depended on an implicit association with traditional
Ýulama. Nor did the Egyptian public see his style of media authority as radi-
cally alternative to that of the leading television preacher of the time, Shaykh
Muhammad Mutawalli ShaÝrawi (d. 1998). Mahmud’s audience considered
these two ‘stars’ as different in style but mutually reinforcing. In Mahmud’s
heyday in the 1980s and early 1990s, his public also listened to him in a dif-
ferent way than they had listened in an earlier era. In an earlier period, Nasser
spoke to audiences. Mahmud spoke with them.
(Salvatore and Eickelman 2004: 21)
I have not seen any studies that make this comparison between the situation in
the 1970s and the present situation in the Islamic field. It is interesting, since it
suggests that the phenomenon of the new preachers might not be as novel as it is
sometimes claimed to be, and that it is not subversive.
However, despite this interesting parallel the religious sphere has developed,
both in Egypt and elsewhere, since the 1980s. To get an additional perspective on
the new preachers’ position in the Islamic field, it is possible to go a bit further
than Islam and compare the culture of the new preachers with the international
pentecostal movement, whose popularity has increased explosively since its hum-
ble beginnings in the USA in the 1920s. There are obvious differences between
the two, but the shared characteristics nevertheless seem so interesting to me that
it is worth making the comparison. In a comprehensive study of pentecostalism,
Harvey Cox (2001) shows that this movement is very diversified, but he identi-
fies some fundamental, common features that apply regardless of cultural and
socioeconomic differences between the different pentecostal congregations across
the globe. In his view, their common denominator is that they all express a ‘pri-
mal spirituality’ (ibid.: 101) in which the intense religious experience is central.
This is an experience that often defies words, hence the widespread practice of
glossolalia, or speaking in tongues. According to Cox, primal spirituality recon-
nects people with religious feelings and expressions that have been lost in modern
160 Islamist rhetoric
cultures, with their emphasis on rationality, logic and order. It is a new kind of
religion that reacts against both the sterility of the modern, rational way of think-
ing and traditional religion:
[T]his experiential spirituality places an enormous load of responsibility on
the individual, and this in turn requires a different form of religious affiliation;
so the new pattern of church is more network than hierarchy. The traditional
authority of the clergy is displaced by a company of seekers who support
each other and provide a setting in which they can mine and reassemble the
religious tradition’s treasures.
(Ibid.: 305)
Consequently, religious professionals often dislike this kind of spirituality. Their
authority as well as that of the scripture is downplayed to the benefit of spiritual
ecstasy and networks of religious amateurs.
Cox claims that this development takes place all over the world, in all the major
religions. His example from the Islamic sphere is modern Sufism, which may be a
good comparison; here, however, it is the new preachers who are to be measured
against Cox’s account. On some counts the comparison is obviously problematic.
For example, ÝAmr KhÁlid has made a point of showing his submission to the reli-
gious professionals and their authority, especially YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ. This does
not resemble pentecostal preachers, who are often more at odds with the religious
establishment. In addition, there is nothing of the ecstasy that marks pentecostal
services in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s live shows or his lectures. While he himself will often
sob and repeat phrases like ‘yÁ l-lÁh’ like a mantra, his audience is much more
passive than the average pentecostal one. There is no shouting of praise or general
jubilation, except that which comes from the stage.
On the other hand, there are some striking similarities between features in pen-
tecostalism and the idiom in which ÝAmr KhÁlid expresses himself. As we have
seen, his language puts the individual and his or her responsibility for his/her
spiritual health in a central position. Cox’s ‘network’ and ‘company of seekers
who support each other’ are also important characteristics of KhÁlid’s preaching,
where he himself appears as a mentor and friend more than a spiritual authority.
The intense, almost eruptive language in combination with a simple and direct
message suggests that a kind of primal spirituality is at work in the religiosity
that ÝAmr KhÁlid represents, even though it is a very well-behaved spirituality.
These factors go a long way to explaining the less than enthusiastic attitude found
among Islamic ulama towards the new preachers. Although KhÁlid and other new
preachers do not position themselves in contradistinction to the religious profes-
sionals, as pentecostalism often does, they take attention and prestige away from
the texts, symbols and actors of establishment Islam. It is not certain whether this
really amounts to a ‘fragmentation of authority’, since the new preachers adhere to
the same episteme as that of mainstream ulama and submit to the teaching propa-
gated by them. But these preachers have certainly effected a kind of religious
diversion for the masses, a turning away from traditional proselytizing that no
Rhetoric and religious ideology 161
doubt vexes the custodians of the Islamic tradition, and all the more so since the
form of the new preaching resembles charismatic preaching in other religions.
A perhaps more important question is whether this spiritual kinship between
the new preaching and pentecostalism can overcome the fundamental distinction
between the self and the ‘other’ that is central in Islamism and that we have seen
at work most clearly in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s discourse above. This is by no means
an uncomplicated question. The difficulties from an Islamist point of view have
been made clear already (see Chapter 3). As for pentecostalism, Cox notes that
there is currently an important struggle going on within it between what he calls
‘experientialism’, i.e. the original pentecostal attitudes that ‘open people to new
outpourings of the divine spirit and a fresh recognition of the motley oneness
of the human family’, and fundamentalism, which ‘channel[s] the emotions it
releases into perpetuating and deepening the ruptures that divide us’.
This question is closely connected to the position that ÝAmr KhÁlid occupies
along the cultural and political axes in the Islamic field. Another important ques-
tion in this respect is to what extent his discourse has any political relevance at all.
Let us turn now to this second problem. In the quote that introduced this section,
Patrick Haenni is probably referring to movements like the Muslim Brotherhood
when he claims that political struggle in the normal sense of the word is discarded
in favour of Kulturkampf in the discourse of the new preachers. While this observa-
tion is undoubtedly correct, I would argue that, even if ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse is
not overtly political in the sense that the Muslim Brotherhood’s is, it still has politi-
cal relevance, albeit only indirectly. The indications that this is so are present, but
they point in more than one direction, and this has to do with the relative novelty of
the phenomenon of the new preachers. One claim that would seem to run counter to
Haenni’s hypothesis is that the new preaching supports political Islamism. During
my fieldwork for this dissertation in Cairo, one scholar suggested to me that ÝAmr
KhÁlid had contributed to the Muslim Brotherhood’s surprisingly good election
results in 2006 simply by raising people’s consciousness about Islam in daily life.3
This seems to me an interesting hypothesis, not least when one considers the fact
that ÝAmr KhÁlid is no longer a preacher just for the rich and well-to-do. His popu-
larity has long since spread to the poorer districts of Giza and the lower-middle-
class areas in BÙlÁq al-DakrÙr and ImbÁba, areas his initial audience have probably
never set foot in. The Muslim Brotherhood is very active and popular in these
segments of the population, and it would not be unnatural if ÝAmr KhÁlid’s preach-
ing has resulted in an increased awareness of Islam in practical life, an awareness
the Brotherhood will know how to take advantage of. If the apolitical discourse
of ÝAmr KhÁlid has contributed to strengthening the Muslim Brotherhood in
Egypt, it automatically acquires a political edge. Hala Moustafa and NabÐl ÝAbd al-
FattÁÎ are among the few Egyptian analysts who grant ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse
political importance.4
However, they have not made explicit their reasons for
claiming this, except for Hala Moustafa’s somewhat vague statement that ÝAmr
KhÁlid is doing politics all the time, even if he does not talk politics. This analysis
supports their claim and suggests a concrete reason for the political saliency of his
discourse: its rhetorical properties.
162 Islamist rhetoric
Paradoxically, perhaps, it can be argued that, together with the focus on the
individual’s responsibility for his/her actions, the near total absence of political
language contributes to giving ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse this political edge. Let
me first argue for the claim that his discourse is not overtly political. The closest I
have come to political references in his texts is a short passage in Wah
.dat al-umma
al-Islmiyya where he asks his readers who of them put the interest of Palestine
and Iraq before themselves:
Is there any among us who invokes God in favour of his umma – firstly –
before he invokes Him in favour of his children?! Is there any among us
who invokes God in favour of Palestine and the captive al-Aqsa mosque, the
beloved Iraq and other violated parts of Islam’s soil before he invokes Him in
favour of his children?!
(KhÁlid 2003c: 21)
But such rather non-committal outbursts are few, a fact which reflects ÝAmr
KhÁlid’s unwillingness to act as a religio-political guiding light. Then there is of
course his intervention in the cartoon controversy in 2006, which obviously had
political implications, even though he himself tried to downplay this aspect of it
(al-Dustr, 22 March 2006, p. 11; al-Mis
.r al-yawm, 18 March 2006, p. 5). When
he finally acted after a prolonged silence and convened a dialogue conference
during the crisis over the cartoons of MuÎammad, it is telling that he sought and
obtained the support of leading ulama in both Egypt and Syria before taking steps
he knew were controversial. But, apart from this, there is precious little in his
discourse that has anything to do with politics, in his texts, in his TV shows or on
his Web site. Whatever ÝAmr KhÁlid’s personal reasons for choosing this path are,
its advantages are obvious. Islamic activism of any kind is highly controversial
in Egypt, and coupling a discourse that emphasizes praxis with a politically sali-
ent content is risky. It is no coincidence that most mainstream Islamist writings
in Egypt focus on theory and admonition instead of down-to-earth praxis. It is
exactly the avoidance of politics that makes it possible for ÝAmr KhÁlid to focus
on action, since he speaks only to the individual and what actions the individual
should take in his or her personal life. When the reader of his texts is forced to
consider him/herself as an agent whose actions mean something, even if only for
him/herself and his/her relationship with God, it makes for an Islam that empha-
sizes responsibility. Even if ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse is apolitical and occupied
with the individual instead of Islamic society, these practical processes make the
reader an active co-creator of contemporary Islam. ÝAmr KhÁlid articulates a reli-
gious ideology that can be termed ‘Islam-as-action’, even if only on the individual

level. And, once people start acting, they are catapulted into society and what
goes on there, and start organizing themselves, as the social initiatives spawned
by ÝAmr KhÁlid’s preaching are a proof of. The personal motivation created by
his discourse propels youths into doing something for their community, or at least
to think about doing something. And, from there, the road is not long to politi-
cally relevant actions such as voting for the one force in Egyptian politics that has
Islamic credentials, especially considering the fact that the social and moral con-
servatism that is an important part of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s discourse corresponds well to
the Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda on the same issues.
Perhaps even more interesting is the effect that the new preachers have had on
political Islamism itself, not least because it points in a slightly different direction,
politically speaking. In a recent book about the changing nature of the Muslim
Brotherhood, ÍusÁm TammÁm states that
There have been fundamental changes in the phenomenon of increased reli-
gious observance. These are not limited to the masses, which are religiously
minded by nature, but they extend also to all the Islamic organizations, espe-
cially those that are most heavily involved in politics. One of the most impor-
tant results of [these changes] is what has been termed the phenomenon of
the new preachers and the new pious [people]. They are connected by vir-
tue of sharing social and intellectual characteristics, and by their behaviour
and practices. These, in turn, have extended into the structure of the Islamic
organizations, moving them in the direction of more openness, relaxed atti-
tudes and humanism, as well as towards modernization, or westernization,
and perhaps even secularism (...).
(TammÁm 2006: 60)
This is a very interesting hypothesis, since it has to do with fundamental changes of
culture in theArab world’s most important Islamist organization. Furthermore, there
is evidence to corroborate it. For obvious political reasons, the Muslim Brotherhood
is not an ideal model of organizational transparency, but it is a well-known fact that

there are competing factions even on the level of cadres, and that one of these fac-
tions favours an embrace of democracy and universal human and political rights
that seems to be almost unconditional. Certain members of the Brotherhood even
quit the organization since they did not think it was moving fast enough in this
direction, and subsequently formed their own party, al-Wasat
., which included two
Copts and one Protestant in its founding committee (Stacher 2002; Utvik 2005:
295–296). This signals a will to dialogue and coexistence that is more advanced
than that found elsewhere among Islamists in Egypt.
Social and political factors such as globalization and inter-religious influences
are of course important in explaining this tendency. However, I would argue that
language is also a valuable explanation factor. I concluded in the analysis of ÝAmr
KhÁlid’s discourse in Chapter 5 that the form gives the impression of a religiosity
that is centred on feelings instead of a distinct religious message. It is also aimed
at the individual as a religious agent rather than group action. This fact makes for
a political flexibility in the discourse of the new religious preachers that is new in
the Islamic field. Apart from its pronounced social conservatism ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
discourse is quite open-ended politically speaking, and its language of feeling
and spirituality rather than fiqh and shar‘a makes it more amenable to relate to
for outsiders. The popularity of ÝAmr KhÁlid among foreign diplomats in Egypt
can be seen in the light of this, as can the plans by British authorities to employ
him as a middleman between themselves and some of the Muslim minorities in
the United Kingdom in 2004 (Hardaker 2006). Moreover, it is not only Europeans
who put their hopes in him. Especially during and after the cartoon crisis, the lib-
eral Egyptian weekly al-Dustr featured an interview with him that was definitely
sympathetic, and the same paper published later the full text of the first programme
in the series ‘ÝAlÁ khuÔÁ al-ÎabÐb’ (On the path of the Beloved), which originally
ran during Ramadan 2005. As for religious pluralism and coexistence with other
religious communities, ÝAmr KhÁlid has himself stated that he has become much
more open, and during his shuttling between Britain and Egypt he worked on a
Ph.D. thesis at the University of Cardiff on peace and coexistence (White 2007).
Accordingly, when considering ÝAmr KhÁlid in an ideological perspective, one
should separate his Islamist ideology and moral conservatism from relations to the
non-Islamic ‘others’ in Egypt and Europe, and this is what makes his ideological
role in the Islamic field different from that of a MuÎammad ÝImÁra and a YÙsuf al-
QaraÃÁwÐ. Whereas they have an aggressive attitude towards more liberal groups
than the centrists, ÝAmr KhÁlid’s language has no room for this kind of polemic.
This is why the sustained criticism of him by some Egyptian secularists, notably
Hala Moustafa, does not really hit the mark. While she correctly points out that
his moral conservatism is the same as mainstream Islamism’s, she fails to appreci-
ate that his message as reflected in his language is not of the confrontational kind
usually associated with Islamism in relation to liberal values and other religions.
Therefore, it is a misleading simplification to put him in the same sociopolitical
category as the Muslim Brotherhood and other established Islamist agents with-
out qualification, notwithstanding the possibility that ÝAmr KhÁlid’s preaching
contributes to their political strength. One could instead argue that his discourse
Rhetoric and religious ideology 165
has the potential of contributing to making Islamist trends in Egypt and Europe
less aggressive and more prone to accept the Western and Egyptian ‘other’. In
other words, his discourse has political salience in the form of a potential for mak-
ing Islamism less inward-looking and more open to other ideologies and value
systems. In relation to both secular and religious ‘others’, then, ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
discourse has the potential of building bridges instead of fortifications, and would
thus fit the trend that Harvey Cox has named ‘experientialism’. ÝAmr KhÁlid’s
prominence, popularity and creativity have made him a ‘one-man movement’.
Other preachers who would also be labelled as new preachers are less enthusi-
astic about dialogue and understanding. In light of this, it is a remarkable feat
that KhÁlid has maintained his popularity while navigating the troubled waters of
identity politics in Egypt and abroad.
This conclusion can explain the uneasiness of the Egyptian regime in relation
to KhÁlid. It has been its long-standing strategy in relation to religious opposition
to try to demonize all the religious movements that they do not at least partly con-
trol. KhÁlid’s preaching makes Islamism look much less sinister than the Egyptian
authorities would probably like it to, both for Egyptians and for foreign observ-
ers. At the same time, he does not talk politics, so it is not easy to clamp down
on him. This dilemma might be behind the abrupt, forced and still unexplained
departure of KhÁlid to Britain in 2002, and the later, seemingly softened attitude
of the regime towards him.
Muh
.ammad ‘Imra
Of the three authors considered here, MuÎammad ÝImÁra offers the most conflict-
oriented contribution to the religious public sphere. In the period since the late
1980s, he has focused on attacking two enemies that are apparently for him the
greatest dangers to the current Islamic awakening: Western (cultural) imperialism
and Arab liberal thinkers. The antithesis he sets up against them is an idealized
version of Islamic history, which he uses as a model for modern centrism. ÝImÁra
is a learned intellectual and can refer to both European and Arab philosophers in
his analyses about culture and religion, but his critique is bigoted. On the rhe-
torical level, he reinforces the impression of an aggressive attitude by employing
tools that are close to coercing the reader into agreement. His rhetorical questions
sometimes stand in for real arguments; his use of exclamation marks and question
marks after quotes and summaries is a metadiscursive tool that directs the reader
toward the evaluation that he wants the reader to adopt; and he places important
parts of his arguments in the residue part of the sentences, so that they are not
made open to critical comments as easily as they could have been.
In an ideological climate that has become more and more polarized since the
latter half of the 1980s, MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s way of writing can only exacerbate
the already existing gulfs between Islamists of all kinds and liberals of all shades in
Egypt. And not only that: in addition, his polemical style of writing has earned him
enemies among other groups that are outside this particular struggle, notably the
Copts, who have accused him of deliberately inciting public opinion against them.5
166 Islamist rhetoric
Exactly because of the sometimes dangerous ideological tension in Egypt, it is
important to note that ÝImÁra is by no means alone with his rather vindictive way
of writing. Within the discourse community of intellectual writing about Islam
in Egypt, there is an important group of figures whose discourse seems to aim at
sharpening the existing lines of conflict in Egypt and internationally. Interestingly,
the figures in this group are from both sides of the secularist/Islamist ideological
divide, and I would argue that it plays an important part in the dynamics of the field
of Islamic thought. For both these reasons, it is worth taking a closer look at some
of the other voices besides ÝImÁra’s here. Perhaps best known on the Islamist side
is the journalist and intellectual FahmÐ HuwaydÐ, who has published a number of
books on religion and politics. Although he writes on a broad variety of issues, not
least corruption and political injustice in the Arab world and internationally, one
of his main concerns is to support and defend the Islamic awakening. Also known
to be a devoted centrist, HuwaydÐ reiterates the same ideas as MuÎammad ÝImÁra
does, with the need to stay true to the Arab-Islamic identity as the overarching
message. Some of his individual rhetorical choices are the same as ÝImÁra’s; some
are not. Notwithstanding, they seem to serve the same overall rhetorical purpose.
A detailed analysis falls outside the scope of this study, but some examples from
his texts are instructive. In an essay entitled ‘al-NuÒÙÒ al-thÁbita fÐ-l-zaman al-
mutaghayyir’ (Firm texts in changing times) (HuwaydÐ 2005b: 69–79), his argu-
ment is that secularists have not properly understood the methods of the fuqah,
and that their claims that Islamic theology and fiqh need to be modernized are
based on the misapprehension that religious judgements are not flexible accord-
ing to time and place. He states that the opposite is the case, which is attested by
Islamic history, and so there is no basis to the claims that religious thought and
reasoning are outdated. The discussion is framed by two rhetorical questions:
Would Islam leave Muslims and humankind to the fluctuations of time
through the centuries right up to the Final Hour without a religiously legiti-
mate [shar‘] intellectual method to deal with the different changes that occur
in various environments and eras?
(Ibid.: 73)
If this is the case, and there is so much leeway, then what do all the angry crit-
ics make a fuss about?. Where is the case that they plead, and on which they
support their criticism of the shar‘a?
(Ibid.: 78)

Rhetoric and religious ideology 167
Note especially the last two questions, which are almost identical to the ones we
analysed in the text by MuÎammad ÝImÁra above (see pp. 119–22). The answer to
them is of course that there is nothing to make a fuss about, that there is in real-
ity no issue to discuss. This conclusion comes after FahmÐ HuwaydÐ has taken
the reader on a less than objective tour through the ventures of the shar‘a, but
what is really interesting from an interpersonal point of view is that he makes
both the secularists and any reader who might still think there is an issue to
be discussed look like imbeciles: the answer to the first question cannot be
anything other than ‘no’, considering how the question is phrased. Few in Egypt,
except for the most devoted atheists, would disagree that the QurÞÁn and the
sunna constitute eternally valid ways of relating to real life, since this is what
most religions are about in the widest sense. What the liberals and secularists criti-
cize is a particular epistemology and a particular way of approaching the religious
texts, rather than the texts in themselves. However, in both the quotes above, as
indeed in the whole essay, FahmÐ HuwaydÐ evades or is unable to comprehend the
fundamental epistemological issue which is the real one here, and instead makes
it look as though the liberals and secularists do not know what they are talking
about.
Another rhetorical tool HuwaydÐ uses often is to implicitly evaluate other per-
sons and their opinions before or instead of presenting arguments about these
opinions, thus directing the reader’s sympathies and antipathies by the use of
purely rhetorical techniques. The following sarcastic passage is from an article
where he discusses a study on ethnicity in the Arab world by the well-known and
outspoken social scientist Saad Eddin Ibrahim:
There are a number of gaps in the study, in which we were delighted to learn
that the greatest security threat to the Arab region in the 1990s will be internal
conflicts (he does not consider nuclear Israel a threat!). At the same time, it
has been stated that the Arab world is considered the most homogeneous area
in the world in terms of ethnicity!
(HuwaydÐ 2005a: 83)
The parenthesis, which is a kind of ‘by the way’comment on Ibrahim’s main thesis,
is clearly meant to strip Ibrahim of intellectual credibility: ‘He fails to see even
the most obvious things!’ There is no argument to show that Israel is objectively a
greater threat than internal conflicts to the security of the Arab region and, in addi-
tion, the comment disregards the fact that Ibrahim is a sociologist and that questions
of nuclear weapons in regional politics are of a different order from the subject of

Ibrahim’s article. Lastly, there is no justification for equating ‘internal conflicts’
with the issue of ethnicity. In the Arab world, religious divides have the poten-
tial to become important markers in conflicts, as shown by the tragic example of
contemporary Iraq. In short, it is an unfair way of presenting Ibrahim’s claims.
The exclamation marks emphasize how unreasonable Ibrahim’s claims are, and
invite the reader to join in HuwaydÐ’s incredulity at Ibrahim’s propositions. The
paragraph comes at the beginning of the article and serves as an introduction to
the real discussion, whose outcome is not very hard to guess at. Evaluation is, on
the whole, more explicit in FahmÐ HuwaydÐ’s texts than in MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s;
for example, the title of the article cited above is ‘RuÞya maghsÙsha li-l-taÝaddudi-
yya’ (A deceptive view of pluralism), and elsewhere he does not hesitate to write
that secularists are ‘sick’ people in need of ‘cultural medicine’ (HuwaydÐ 2002:
77–78).
While the focus in this study is on Islamist discourse, it would be a mistake
to think that liberal discourses do not exhibit the same manipulative rhetoric as
MuÎammad ÝImÁra and FahmÐ HuwaydÐ use. The most prominent outlet of such
discourse today is probably the weekly magazine Rz al-Ysuf, which seems to
run a permanent campaign against all things religious. One of its prolific col-
umnists (until 2005, when he suddenly disappeared from public view following
alleged death threats) was the historian Sayyid MaÎmÙd al-QimanÐ, who has
published several polemical books against Islamism and what he terms ahl
al-dn (religious professionals) in general. Explicitly placing himself in the
tradition of the secularist Faraj FÙda, who was murdered by violent Islamists in
1992, he calls for radical reform in Islamic thought and practice, based on a critical
historical reading of the holy texts and early Islamic history. His rhetoric resem-
bles that of ÝImÁra in the long adverbials and repetitions of the argument, while
his sarcastic, strongly evaluative tone is very close to HuwaydÐ’s. Two examples
of how he heaps sarcasm and accusations on top of each other without adding
anything to the argument will suffice here. Asking what the Muslim Brotherhood
means by da‘wa, he embarks on the following harangue in the form of rhetorical
questions:
(...) Do they want to direct the call to Islam to Muslims who embraced the
religion 1,224 years ago? Or do you think their call is to another Islam than
that which we know from our Prophet and QurÞÁn, and to which we submit-
ted? Or do they want to call us to the same Islam, but they think the first mis-

sionary was not up to the task? Or do they want to call us to another Islam than

(al-QimanÐ 2006: 233)
These questions are obviously meant to both ridicule the Muslim Brotherhood’s
da‘wa (missionary) activities and show how outrageous their whole ideologi-
cal enterprise is. al-QimanÐ’s frequent claims to be an open-minded liberal who
cherishes dialogue are flatly contradicted by this kind of rhetoric. As for his long
adverbials, they repeat and sum up arguments he has already presented, just as
MuÎammad ÝImÁra does:
Following the lapse of intellectual labour according to human reflection, and
the excommunication of the MuÝtazila, who insisted on judging by standards
of reason if they contradicted the sacred law (al-shar‘) in any questions the
Muslims encountered, according to the primacy of human interest before that
of religion, for the interest of religion is [fundamentally] equal to the interest
of the worshippers ... Following the lapse of reason and its role, the religious
jurists discovered, by reverse deduction, principles that were (originally) dis-
covered by human reflection and interpretation (...).
(al-QimanÐ 2004: 257)
al-QimanÐ is thus part of the same rhetorical culture as HuwaydÐ and ÝImÁra, even
if he stands on the opposite side of the ideological divide. Common for them is that
they do not play a constructive role in a critical dialogue, despite their embrace of
values such as open-mindedness and rational argumentation.
In contrast to the writers of such discourses, there are other writers who focus
less on the act of attacking than the reason for attacking other thought directions.
Among the liberals, NaÒr ÍÁmidAbÙ Zayd writes a level-headed and intellectually
penetrating prose even at his most polemical, as in the book Naqd al-khit
.b al-
dn, which has also been translated into European languages. He is by no means
neutral; his ideological point of view is clear from the very outset. However, there
are no suggestive rhetorical questions, no long repetitions of what has already
been said. Furthermore, no strongly evaluative labels such as the ones HuwaydÐ

employs are used. The opinions are stated succinctly, based on long and explicit
arguments and with numerous and detailed references to sources that are treated
critically. All this makes for arguments that are more transparent and easier to
relate to than the harangues offered by the more confrontational writers we have
studied in this section. Incidentally, one of the writers that AbÙ Zayd argues
against is HuwaydÐ, and the former’s way of arguing can usefully be compared to
the latter’s:
One of the representatives of the moderate trend says: ‘There is not one pro-
gressive Islam and another one that is regressive, just as there is no revolution-
ary versus submissive Islam or a political versus social one or an Islam of the
rulers versus an Islam for the masses. There is one Islam and one Book which
God sent down to his Prophet, who conveyed it to the people.’This statement
is contradicted by Islamic history itself, a history that witnessed a ‘plurality’
of directions, tendencies and ‘factions’ that erupted because of social, eco-
nomic and political reasons. They formulated their positions by employing
personal interpretation [ta’wl wa-ijtihd] to understand the texts. However,
this insistence on the existence of one Islam and the rejection of the actual
pluralism has a number of results, regardless of the intentions of this or that
writer. The first result is that Islam has one meaning only, which is fixed and
not influenced by either the movement of history or the various societies [in

which it has been embedded], not to speak of the different groups within one
society that emerged because of diverging interests. The other result is that
the meaning of this one Islam is monopolized by only one group of people,
namely the religious experts, and that the members of this group are viewed
as being above natural human predilections and personal leanings.
(AbÙ Zayd 1995: 79)
In this excerpt, the quote from FahmÐ HuwaydÐ’s book al-Qur’n wa-l-sult
.n
(HuwaydÐ 2002) is given without inserted comments that predispose the reader to
look sceptically at it before the discussion starts, and HuwaydÐ is stated to belong
to the ‘moderate trend’, a description with which the centrists can agree. Although
the view proposed by FahmÐ HuwaydÐ is severely criticized, AbÙ Zayd does not
try to make it look outrageous or scandalous, and he does not ridicule it – on the
contrary, he takes it very seriously and tries to explicate what he thinks the logical
consequences of such a view are. The style is thus very different from the more
propagandist prose that ÝImÁra, HuwaydÐ and al-QimanÐ write, and is an invitation
to earnest discussion more than to jumping into ideological trenches. In short, it
is more constructive. Both HuwaydÐ and YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ are objects of AbÙ
Zayd’s criticism in large sections of the book, and the treatment is always the
same as here: fair and accurate descriptions of their positions followed by sharp,
but reasoned, critique.
This rhetoric of critical, but constructive, moderation is not confined to the
liberal segments of the Egyptian intelligentsia. Among the Islamists there are also
voices that encourage reflection and deliberation instead of aggressively reiterat-
ing the same message over and over. ÓÁriq al-BishrÐ is one such voice. His ideo-
logical positions are typical Islamist ones: the cultural heritage as the all-important
identity determiner is a central idea, and the West is seen as an intruder, its ide-
ologies and ideas alien to Arab culture. Behind this claim is the premise of par-
ticularity, which makes analyses of one culture in terms of concepts developed in
another invalid – each culture must be analysed according to its own history and
characteristics (e.g. al-BishrÐ 2005: 48–66). But the way in which he phrases his
propositions is dramatically different from that of MuÎammad ÝImÁra and FahmÐ
HuwaydÐ. A conspicuous interpersonal feature of his texts is epistemic modaliza-
tion. This is most often signalled by the use of the first person singular. As an
example, consider a sentence from the essay which I referred to above, ‘MafhÙm
al-muÝÁÒara bayn al-ÝÁlamayn al-gharbÐ wa-l-islÁmÐ’:
Here, I do not present a study or a scholarly piece of work, nor do I assess
values and concepts, but I present what I think is the central idea behind the
values that are dominating at present.

172 Islamist rhetoric
This sentence begins with a disclaimer, which is in itself rare in the texts of
MuÎammad ÝImÁra, and then al-BishrÐ goes on to make it clear that he presents
merely his own view of things, implying that there are other ways of looking at
reality too. His actual positions are in fact clear cut and voiced very explicitly in
the whole essay, but the interpersonal flavour of the text – the way in which he
approaches the reader – makes them less face-threatening than ÝImÁra’s. And, to
people who disagree with the positions from the outset, his tone is much more
congenial and easier to conduct an internal dialogue with. He also uses hedges, a
feature I have not been able to find at all in ÝImÁra’s texts. Consider the excerpts
from the introduction to the same book (pp. 7–14, hedges in bold type):
But I would almost claim that what we term contemporary for us, whether it
is values, systems or thoughts, etc., does not stem from our past, distinguished
from it only by the distance of time (...).
(Ibid.: 9)
If this proposition is correct, it means that the ‘traditionalists’ prefer the
word ‘Islam’, while those who subscribe to imported ideas prefer the usage of
the word ‘tradition’ [turth].
(Ibid.)
But it is not necessarily the case in relation to contemporaneity that the
European modern age should correspond or be similar to theArab and Muslim
modern age, (...).
(Ibid.: 11)
The prose is characterized by a greater degree of cautiousness and reserve by
virtue of these hedges, which are realized in various grammatical ways through-
out al-BishrÐ’s texts. To be fair, there is also some use of rhetorical questions and
exclamation marks in his books, but the effect is nevertheless milder than in the
other texts we have looked at. Instead of signalling that the author views a particu-
lar claim as outrageous or ridiculous, as ÝImÁra tends to do, al-BishrÐ’s questions

Rhetoric and religious ideology 173
function as interactive devices to introduce or sum up his own substantial
arguments.
The differences I have pointed at in this section have an important political con-
sequence. MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s way of writing actively restricts the possibility of
having a dialogue across ideologies and cultures. There are two reasons that it has
this effect. First, one simply does not want to have a dialogue with someone who
does his best to make others’opinions seem harmful, ridiculous and inferior. Such
a discourse is designed to perpetuate conflicts, as it were. Second, when these
discourses enter the public arena, they are naturally given attention by the media
because of the media’s love of conflicts. Consequently, MuÎammad ÝImÁra, FahmÐ
HuwaydÐ and Sayyid al-QimanÐ have all figured on the popular al-JazÐra show
al-Ittijh al-mu‘kis (The opposite direction), which has a tendency to degenerate
into a shouting match, and ÝImÁra and HuwaydÐ are prominent newspaper com-
mentators in the Arab world. Over time, such exposure embodies them and their
way of communicating as archetypes of ideological trends such as secularism and
Islamism, even if the actual picture is much more nuanced, as we have just seen.
It should be added here that the same situation pertains in Europe. In Norway,
for example, the Norwegian translation of Oriana Fallaci’s The Rage and the Pride
(2003) and a book by a member of the conservative party about how Islam invades
Europe (Berg 2007) have both received much attention in the Norwegian media.
In contrast, a critical, but much more nuanced, book about Islam’s epistemology
and relation to human rights and liberal values published at the same time (Gule
2006) hardly received attention at all. Both the former books are written in the
form of personal letters, and the rhetorical tools are of an entirely different kind
from the ones surveyed here, but they also have the effect of creating and uphold-
ing not only differences, but animosity, between different ideologies within their
societies as well as between West and East. (It should also be noted that Fallaci’s
book in particular relies on a rhetoric that is infinitely more vindictive and vulgar
than anything I have discussed in this study.) The focus in this book has been on
how the metadiscourse of one particular actor, MuÎammad ÝImÁra, contributes to
this polarization and alienation; similar studies of other discourses about culture
and religion would no doubt be an important contribution to the critique of such
discourses.
These comments impinge on the concept of ‘centrism’, which has become very
popular with scholars of modern Islam and mainstream Islamists themselves. In
recent literature about Islamism, the term ‘centrism’ has become a label for those
non-violent Islamists who actively engage with contemporary international and
local issues and try to make a synthesis of the modern and the classical Islamic
thought traditions. MuÎammad ÝImÁra is counted within this group, as is ÓÁriq al-
BishrÐ, MuÎammad SalÐm al-ÝAwwÁ, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, KamÁl AbÙ al-Majd and
others. As noted in Chapter 3, there is a tendency to lump all the centrists together
in one homogeneous group. In contrast to that approach this study shows that there
are important differences between these figures in terms of their socio-religious
roles (e.g. YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ as a preacher and MuÎammad ÝImÁra as an intellec-
tual) and their approach to their readers and opponents. If ÝImÁra is centrist in his
174 Islamist rhetoric
propositions, which I think is correct, he certainly has not found the middle way of
phrasing his propositions. This fact obviously has consequences for how Islamism
is perceived by outsiders and for how the readers of Islamist literature perceive
the Western and secular ‘other’, and I think that should be reflected more prop-
erly in scholarly literature about Islamism. This is not least important considering
that current debate in most European public arenas is often characterized by too
simplistic views of Islamist movements in the Arab world, whether these views
are hostile or friendly towards such movements. A more nuanced understanding
of Islamist currents is vital for the unavoidable question of whom to deal with, and
how to deal with them. In this respect, attending to rhetoric can be a rewarding
endeavour.
Conclusion
First I would like to note one point about the ideological significance of these
three discourses as a whole in Egyptian society. Differences in content and form
notwithstanding, they are so many enunciations of the Islamist trend, which was
defined in Chapter 3. Admittedly, the central elements of this world-view are
made explicit mostly in the books by YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ and MuÎammad ÝImÁra,
while it remains largely an implicit premise for the discourse of ÝAmr KhÁlid,
perhaps on account of his small amount of traditional Islamic cultural capital.
But the important point for the present argument is that Islamism is the epistemic
fundament of all three of the discourses. This fact goes to show that Islamism is
not merely a trend or a movement associated with more or less organized group-
ings in the Arab world, as it is often treated in European and American literature
on the subject, as well as in the media. al-QaraÃÁwÐ speaks to probably millions of
Arabs each week on the weekly show al-Shar‘a wa-l-h
.ay on al-JazÐra channel,
and several of his books have been translated into other languages than Arabic. As
for ÝAmr KhÁlid, he is wildly popular among youths who are not politicized in the
slightest, and nobody talks about his supporters as a movement, except, of course,
in the instances where the enthusiasm takes the form of organizations like ÑunnÁÝ
al-ÎayÁ. MuÎammad ÝImÁra is perhaps easier to place in a delimited political cat-
egory, as close to the independent Islamists, but then again his writing activities
span a large area, from islamization of science literature to broad, scholarly work
such as editing and commenting on modernist Muslim classics.
All this points at a fact that is seldom offered much space in literature on non-
violent Islamism: its diversity within unity, so to speak. Most research about the
topic tends to concentrate on unity, i.e. Islamism, in the singular, as a counterforce
to corrupt regimes and Western culture and moral norms (or the lack of them).
One good example of this is Geneive Abdo’s detailed and perceptive account of
non-violent Islamism in contemporary Egypt (Abdo 2000). Despite seeing and
describing several different enunciations of Islamism, she prioritizes an analy-
sis that lumps them all together and posits Islamism as one unified force against
the secularized state and its elites. As we saw in Chapter 3 (the section ‘The
wasat
.iyya intellectuals’), the same is true for most treatments of centrism. It is
Rhetoric and religious ideology 175
generally posited as a coherent ideology and group. However, going into specif-
ics, as we have done with the linguistic aspects of Islamism here, reminds us of
the fact that Islamism is not a homogeneous social and political force, and neither
is the more restricted movement of centrism. They consist of various groups with
different interests, exemplified here by three discourses that have very different
priorities in the way they construct their authors, their readers and Islam. These
differences are salient on more than the linguistic level, as we can see from the
roles al-QaraÃÁwÐ and KhÁlid create for themselves and their readers.
There is another fact that is also pointed to by the use of very different idioms to
enunciate the same ideological message within such a small sphere as publishing
for the religiously minded middle class: contemporary Islamism can draw effort-
lessly and successfully on several different idioms in Egypt today. This is proof
that its basic propositions have become common sense in the Egyptian public
sphere. As Norman Fairclough writes, drawing on the work of sociologist Harold
Garfinkel (1967), common-sense assumptions are ‘implicit, backgrounded, taken
for granted, not things that people are consciously aware of, rarely explicitly for-
mulated or examined or questioned’ (Fairclough 2001: 64).
Thus the three authors discussed here mostly do not discuss the premises on
which their normative statements rest, and when these premises are taken into
account they are stated as indisputable facts rather than being discussed. At the
same time, this fact greatly facilitates the dissemination of Islamism as an order
of discourse in Egyptian society. In contrast, liberal, secular discourses can never
define reality in a way as straightforward as al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s or as simply as ÝAmr
KhÁlid does, because they continuously have to explicate their epistemology and
their arguments for people to be able to understand them in the first place. This
fact puts severe restrictions on the potential impact of liberal Islamic thought. In a
brilliant article about the difficulties of approaching the QurÞÁn with a hermeneutic
method, Rotraud Wielandt (1996) lists several socio-religious and political factors
that impede such an approach. To her list can be added, I think, the inherent prop-
erties of texts about religion themselves: the new hermeneutic and liberal texts are
simply less accessible in all senses of the word than the Islamist discourse, which
has a number of idioms at its disposal.
Let us now turn to the specific differences between the three writers. The net
effect of ÝImÁra’s, al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and KhÁlid’s efforts is to further strengthen the
islamization of the public and private spheres in Egypt.At the same time, however,
there are differences between them in the religio-political and ideological areas
that result from their use of persuasive tools. These differences show that main-
stream Islamism contains certain tensions and even contradictions. Interestingly,
in both areas it is KhÁlid’s discourse that is in conflict with either ÝImÁra’s or al-
QaraÃÁwÐ’s. The discourses of the latter two complement each other seamlessly
– al-QaraÃÁwÐ lets ÝImÁra engage with the secular and liberal ‘other’, while he
takes the role of the authoritative teacher and vice versa, and their themes are
very similar. KhÁlid’s discourse touches on both the role of the spiritual teacher
and the attitude to the ‘other’, and it does not fit seamlessly into either of them.
KhÁlid’s style as a d‘iya is diametrically opposed to al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s, and his
176 Islamist rhetoric
approach to the ‘other’ is far more conciliatory than ÝImÁra’s. Consequently, he
upsets the structure of the Islamic field in two ways. First, in terms of positions in
the Islamic field, his appearance on the scene displaces, in the words of Bourdieu,
already established discourses and the relations between agents and audience that
they embody in the field. Most visibly, he competes in a way with the ulama,
even though he does not touch their religious prerogatives like making definite
dogmatic statements and issuing fatwas. The competition is rather in terms of
bringing a new symbolic capital into the activity of preaching for the people.
Second, in terms of ideology ÝAmr KhÁlid’s simple message about spiritual-
ity, love and solidarity stands in contrast to the conflict-driven discourse of most
Islamists. Since he simply evades the question of the ‘other’ and focuses instead
on the relationship the reader has to him and to him/herself and other individuals,
his discourse appears less aggressive than even the carefully balanced prose of
ÓÁriq al-BishrÐ, not to speak of MuÎammad ÝImÁra. However, he does not interfere
with the intellectuals’ function of explicating the world and reflecting on history,
society and politics, and implicitly he takes their ideology for granted, so he repre-
sents less of a threat to their position in the field than he does vis-à-vis the ulama.
But, at the same time, his focus on feelings, openness and dialogue can influence
the whole ideology that the Islamist intellectuals build on and make it more open
towards the ‘other’. Thus, if we concede that it makes a difference how a religious
ideology is put into words, KhÁlid’s discourse has the most potential of building
bridges of, if not understanding, then at least acceptance of other world-views.
8 Conclusion
Two main issues have been addressed in this book. First, we asked: what are the
rhetorical differences between the written discourses of YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, ÝAmr
KhÁlid and MuÎammad ÝImÁra, and how can these differences be conceptualized?
The second question was what the rhetorical differences might mean when inter-
preted in the context of contemporary tensions in Islamic thought and practice. To
my knowledge no systematic attempt has until now been made to explicate and
interpret the rhetorical differences in the Islamic field. An important premise for
this study has been that such mapping is necessary to better understand current
Arab-Islamic culture. For if we accept that texts are constitutive of a culture, and
also constituted by that culture, then such systematic investigations are one tool
among others in understanding cultural phenomena. Accordingly, our main focus
has not been on persuasive tools in themselves, but on the ways in which the use
of them can be connected to social fields and religious ideology.
Our analysis has teased out distinctions and tensions within Islamism which
are often neglected. One important insight is that Islamist writers conceive very
differently of authority, participation and relations with the non-Islamist ‘other’.
In addition, we have seen that the Islamist ideology is sustained in a variety of
ways in different discourse communities. This reflects the fact that Islamism as
a general, cultural framework has become common sense in the Egyptian public
sphere, i.e. Islamist ideology is the natural filter through which to view the world
across different discourse communities. Furthermore, the emphasis on linguistics
in the analysis has provided a new perspective, one that enables us to perceive
parallels between expressions of Islamism and other, very different, ideological
currents. Comparisons have been made with phenomena as different as secularist
polemics in the Arab world and Europe on the one hand, and the global pentecos-
tal movement on the other. In the following, I will restate the main conclusions.
Considering the dearth of research about modernArabic rhetorical practices, I will
also suggest some directions for future research that might prove profitable.
We have investigated the ways in which images of writer, readers and Islam
are construed in three grammatical domains: pronominal reference, mood struc-
tures (like interrogatives and imperatives) and, finally, the syntactic expression
of processes and participants. It turns out that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, ÝAmr KhÁlid
and MuÎammad ÝImÁra use these linguistic resources in very different ways. Put
178 Islamist rhetoric
schematically, each of the three can be associated with one of the means of per-
suasion identified by Aristotle: ethos, pathos and logos. al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s efforts to
persuade rely mainly on a construction of his ethos as a contemporary religious
authority in Sunni Islam. He emphasizes his institutional authority in two main
ways. On the one hand he casts himself as the judge of who is entitled to speak
about religion and who is not, and on the other his style betrays an intimate
knowledge of high-flown rhetoric; his style is often described by Egyptians as
fus
.h
. turthiyya, heritage Arabic. His personal authority is constructed by the
references to himself in the first person and the distance he creates between him-
self and the readers. In accordance with this emphasis on an ethos of authority, he
does not argue against explicitly stated positions, but states his own positions as
the definitive truth. The result of this is an image of the religious professionals as
the final arbiters in all questions that involve Islam.
ÝAmr KhÁlid on the other hand relies almost wholly on the persuasive means
of pathos. This is natural, since he has no formal qualifications as a preacher and
teacher, and since he can hardly be described as an intellectual who is comfortable
with the pro et contra of argumentative discourse. But he handles the rhetorical
possibilities within the domain of pathos with great skill, relying on feelings not
only to awaken Muslims’ passion for their religion, but also to endow them with
the religious self-esteem needed to actively engage in practical work for their
religion, whether in the personal or the social arena. In contrast to al-QaraÃÁwÐ, he
cultivates a close relationship with his readers, acting as a friend and mentor rather
than as an authority. This can be seen most clearly in his extremely frequent use
of second person pronouns and an inclusive ‘we’, as well as in his many impera-
tives and exclamations that are directed at the reader. The friendship strategy is
a phenomenon in Islamic preaching that is just as novel as the new preachers
themselves, since the previous generation of charismatic preachers such as shaykh
Kishk, while also relying on pathos, were still authorities who remained aloof from
their audience. Also in direct contrast to al-QaraÃÁwÐ, KhÁlid creates an image of
ordinary believers as activists who really matter. There is no pyramidal structure
in the picture of Islam he draws. By constantly construing the reader as an active
agent, he encourages a lay Muslim culture where the individual acts confidently
on the basis of general Islamic ethical and theological principles.
As for MuÎammad ÝImÁra, his style is somewhat more versatile than those of
the other two, and he does not as clearly rely on one single means of persuasion.
However, there are some clear patterns. While he employs the rhetorical means
of pathos to some degree, notably in exclamations, his ultimate means of persua-
sion is undoubtedly logos. His way of persuading people about the epistemic and
moral value of the Islamist trend is to adduce proof for his claims and refute other
world-views as well as the arguments of the opponents of Islamism. Rhetorical
questions are among the prominent strategies used, as are frequent and long repeti-
tions of preceding arguments in adverbials. In addition, it has been shown that he
embeds ideologically contestable claims within adverbials, which makes it more
difficult for the reader to criticize or question his arguments. He uses pronominal
reference to retain a scholarly distance from what he writes about, even when
Conclusion 179
the text concerns the Muslim community, which he strongly sympathizes with.
The academic, inclusive ‘we’ features prominently in his texts, showing that he
tries to include the reader in the argumentation. These traits convey a somewhat
conflicting image, where the detached, objective scholar often alternates with the
aggressive polemicist.
These textual differences are interesting and suggest that there is much to be
gained from more focused research into genre differences in religious discourse
– more on that shortly. In this book, however, the main emphasis has been on the
social and political significance of the way in which persuasive tools are used.
Here also, a number of interesting conclusions were arrived at.
First, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s emphasis on authority places him at the forefront
of the ulama’s struggle to secure their position as the ultimate authorities of reli-
gious knowledge in Sunni Islam. The current situation in global Islam has been
described as exhibiting a fragmentation of authority, an observation that has been
thoroughly substantiated by research within social anthropology and media stud-
ies (Eickelman and Piscatori 1996; Eickelman and Anderson 2003). However,
at the same time, other research has shown that the ulama have had some suc-
cess in claiming authority for themselves (Zaman 2002). In YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s
texts, the preoccupation with asserting authority is evident in all the domains we
have analysed, whether it is pronominal reference, the monologous way of mak-
ing arguments or the way of verbally constructing hierarchies, in-groups and out-
groups. The point can be made that for YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ the drive for religious
authority seems to be an end in itself. Though sometimes stated rather bluntly, the
claim to authority is made to a large extent through metadiscursive means, and is
thus conveyed implicitly, serving to make YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and other ulama’s
authority self-evident, a fact of life not to be questioned or discussed.
One ideologically salient point here is that his project contradicts the generally
held attitude that there is no clergy in Islam, or at least in Sunni Islam, and that
his way of writing contributes to recreating a firm division between a religious
elite (khs
.s
.a) and an ignorant public (‘mma) that was propagated by AbÙ ÍÁmid
al-GhazÁlÐ in the twelfth century AD. His rhetoric is clearly meant to exclude other
Islamic thinkers from being legitimate agents in the field of Islamic thought. At
the same time, the relative lack of real discussion in his texts suggests that such
argument is to be conducted within the ranks of the Islamic scholars, while the
public is presented only with the ‘truths’ this collegium reaches.
Another important point is that YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ is a highly successful Islamic
scholar with enormous influence. Seen in this light the analysis of his rhetoric
suggests a development that is neglected in the hypothesis about fragmentation
of authority referred to above, perhaps because of its focus on the political field.
The results arrived at in the analysis, which concentrated on language and the field
of religious thought, reinforce a picture of the ulama as a group that is gaining
ground in the Islamic field, despite the modern plethora of agents in this field.
al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s authority-centred rhetoric may be seen as the culmination of a long
process of convergence between mainstream ulama and non-violent Islamist ideol-
ogy, represented by the Muslim Brotherhood and their sympathizers. These two
180 Islamist rhetoric
groups have often been portrayed as antagonists, for reasons both social and ideo-
logical. But some research literature has also noted a tendency for mutual sympathy
and even support among segments within them (e.g. Skovgaard-Petersen 1997:
208–227). This tendency has been particularly clear with popular and media-savvy
ulama such as MuÎammad MutawallÐ al-ShaÝrÁwÐ, MuÎammad al-GhazÁlÐ and, last
but not least, YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ, whose influence exceeds that of both the former
men. In this way, Islamism converges with Islamic orthodoxy. The analysis has
shown how al-QaraÃÁwÐ takes advantage of this process to secure a crucial power
of definition in all questions Islamic. This is not to deny the existence of many
different voices in the Islamic public sphere. However, several of the most well
known among these voices, such as ÝAmr KhÁlid, explicitly or implicitly accept
the defining power of the ulama. In this picture, al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s insistence on his
institutional and personal authority seems to me a self-assured and even aggressive
act. A correlated conclusion is that, even though al-QaraÃÁwÐ can be said to reach
out to the common Muslim, this in no way entails that his way of writing empow-
ers common Muslims in relation to their belief and practices. The opposite seems
in fact to be the case.
Second, the analysis of ÝAmr KhÁlid’s rhetoric has opened some interesting
perspectives on the role of the new preaching in Egypt and the Arab world, even
though this is a recent phenomenon whose political and ideological impact it is
still difficult to assess. Ideologically, KhÁlid’s discourse is not subversive, since
he explicitly submits to centrist, Islamist ideology and the authority of the ulama.
However, the new form of symbolic capital he has introduced into the religious
field has made him extremely popular among the laity. Consequently, he diverts
their attention from the Islamic scholars who wish to monopolize this attention
with their religious guidance and teaching. Thus it is natural that he and other
new preachers are unpopular with the ulama, even if the objective effect of their
preaching is to further strengthen the hold of Islamist discourse over contempo-
rary Arab Islamic culture.
There is more to KhÁlid’s rhetoric than its socio-religious impact, though. When
seen in conjunction with recent religio-political events, it seems clear that his dis-
course might have the potential of supporting the activist and political aspects
of Islamism in Egypt, while at the same time attenuating Islamist ideology’s tra-
ditional xenophobia. Whereas the content of KhÁlid’s discourse is not explicitly
political, his rhetoric encourages the individual believers to engage actively in
social and idealistic work based on an Islamist ethos. It has been suggested that
this might have contributed to the surprisingly strong performance of the Muslim
Brotherhood in Egypt’s 2005 parliamentary elections. However, equally impor-
tant is the suggestion that the influence goes the other way, so to speak. That is,
KhÁlid’s rhetoric might contribute to a less aggressive and xenophobic form of
Islamism. This claim has been made on account of striking similarities between
KhÁlid’s idiom and that of the open-minded parts of the pentecostal movement,
where spirituality, community and feelings are favoured at the cost of doctrinal
purity and fundamentalist attitudes. KhÁlid’s intervention in the cartoon crisis and
his efforts at reaching out to Egypt’s Coptic community support the suggestion
Conclusion 181
that his rhetoric might have ideological and political significance. If this picture is
correct, it also explains the seemingly confused attitude on the part of the Egyptian
authorities towards KhÁlid. They naturally want to stop a man and a movement
that might contribute to the spread of activist Islamism in Egypt, but at the same
time it is very difficult to clamp down on a movement whose message is apolitical
and inclusive, being based at the same time on commonly accepted values among
ordinary Egyptians.
Third, the analysis has refined the view of the ideologically charged genre (in
Egypt and the Arab world) of intellectual writing about Islam, and it has shown
where MuÎammad ÝImÁra’s rhetoric is situated within this genre. The comparison
made with other writers makes it clear that his rhetoric belongs to a group that is
geared towards emphasizing and exacerbating ideological differences rather than
engaging in critical dialogue. This claim is based on the observation that impor-
tant parts of his argumentation are not open and transparent. Instead, he embeds a
number of statements and claims in parts of the sentence that are not immediately
accessible for counter-argument. In addition, he relies on rhetorical questions and
punctuation to prod the reader to accept his evaluations and arguments without
arguing properly for them. In contrast to KhÁlid’s discourse, then, ÝImÁra’s texts
seem to increase Islamist xenophobia rather than attenuating it.
Interestingly, the divide between those who rely on aggressive polemic and
those who favour a more dialogue-oriented style cuts right through the middle
of centrism, or wasat
.iyya, in Egypt. It is important to stress this, since in most
research literature the centrists are presented as a homogeneous group. Their
function is thought to be a progressive and liberal one in relation to traditional
Islamism. The insight that significant differences in approaching the ‘other’obtain
in this group adds an important qualification to the assessments made of centrism
up till now. In a wider perspective, I have suggested that ÝImÁra’s rhetoric is part
of a polarizing discourse that is currently prominent in the Arab world, Europe
and the USA. This style is characterized by aggressive polemics with an attend-
ant lack of self-reflexive critical impulses, and a black-and-white view of culture
and religion. It forces the reader either to accept the arguments uncritically or to
be utterly alienated: either you are with us or you are against us. Islamism may be
presented in ways that make for more or less conflict with other world-views and
groups. ÝImÁra’s rhetoric definitely belongs in the first category.
These are the conclusions our analysis permits us to draw about the relation
between rhetoric and the dynamics of the Islamic field. They point to several
paths for future research. One interesting area for further studies is the intersec-
tion between genre, text and discourse. I have criticized the generalizing claim
that, in contemporary Arabic persuasive prose, repetition of a statement serves as
a substitute for arguing that statement. The present analysis shows that influential
Arab writers rely on several different strategies, and that institutional and personal
authority as well as real argumentation is among them. I opted for a broad-based
analytic approach, and one consequence of this was that discourses were com-
pared regardless of the fact that they belong to different genres. However, the
short comparisons with other works in the genres of religious guidance literature
182 Islamist rhetoric
and religious polemics that I made in Chapter 7 show that there are interesting
differences within these genres. Some preliminary studies have been made about
these questions from a text-linguistic perspective, notably Hatim (1991, 1996),
but I am not aware of any large-scale, comprehensive attempts at studying ways
of arguing and persuading within different genres in Islamic religious discourse.
Analyses that are given less to qualitative interpretation and more to systematic
comparisons across a large corpus would probably be rewarding, particularly if
genre is understood as a kind of social action and a cultural artefact, as argued
convincingly by Carolyn Miller (1994a, 1994b). This would be a welcome addi-
tion to the study of contemporaryArabic written discourse. For example, in regard
to texts by the ulama, an interesting measuring rod for their rhetoric exists already
in the form of ‘ilm al-balgha. Judging from al-QaraÃÁwÐ’s and others’ discourse,
this Arabo-Islamic rhetorical theory still seems to retain normative power, but it is
an open and interesting question how and to what degree prominentArab religious
professionals relate to it. A study of many more texts than those considered here,
using automatic tools such as a tagged corpus, could shed light on the role that ‘ilm
al-balgha as a discourse organizing tool plays in the genre of contemporary reli-
gious instruction. This is only one of a number of possible further explorations on
the theme of rhetoric and society in the Arab Islamic sphere, and it is facilitated by
the growing number of available corpora, which would add a quantitative dimen-
sion that the present book lacks.
More research about the connection between rhetoric and ideology should also
prove rewarding. The phenomenon of the new preachers is still relatively new,
and its various manifestations have not been studied in depth. The only in-depth
studies there are – except for the ideologically charged work by WÁÞil LuÔfÐ (2005)
– deal with ÝAmr KhÁlid, since he is the most famous of the new preachers. Further
research on their discourse is needed. One possibility is to compare the discourses
of a broad range of personalities within this trend to analyse where their ideologi-
cal and communicative impulses come from, and how these impulses are com-
bined and altered in the new preachers’ discourse. Here, only one, albeit a very
important, such discourse has been studied, and a broader scope might well reveal
interesting similarities and differences within the group of the new preachers.
On a general note, I hope this book has demonstrated the potential a linguistic
analysis has for making sense of how texts contribute to constituting culture. This
approach to studying Arab society and culture is still a marginal one, although
isolated examples exist and continue to appear. The book will have achieved an
important aim if it has succeeded in showing that in studies of Islam and Arab
culture not only the content, but also the form of the source texts, carries interest-
ing meanings.
Notes
1 Introduction
1 This literature is not directly relevant to our purposes and will not be treated here.
However, it forms a natural cognitive backdrop to the present study. Some of the central
works I have in mind are Kepel (1985, 2002), Ayubi (1991), Mitchell (1993 [1969]),
Zubaida (1993), Choueiri (1997) and Euben (1999).
2 Rhetorical analysis and the study of social reality
1 This example is directly inspired by the excerpts from real newspaper articles analysed
in Tony Trew’s article ‘Theory and ideology at work’ (Fowler et al. 1979: 94–116). The
immediate ideological implications of the various construals are pretty obvious; for an
incisive in-depth analysis, see Trew’s article.
3 Islamic ideology and the public sphere in Egypt
1 It is also defined in distinction to violent forms of Islamism, but this issue falls outside
the scope of the present study.

4 Some excellent analyses of these institutions and their history are available, in particu-
lar al-Azhar and DÁr al-ÞIftÁÞ. See, for example, Eccel (1984) and Skovgaard-Petersen
(1997), respectively.
5 This failure to identify any ‘traditionalists’, whether in objective scholarship like
MuÎammad ÍÁfiÛ’s study or in the texts of the independent Islamists themselves, is a
curious lack of detail in all discourse on traditionalists. If they are so important and have
so much leverage in religious questions, then why are none of them named as prominent
personalities, as is the case when the Islamists and objective scholars discuss liberal and
secular thinkers? I have not found any satisfactory answer to this question.
6 Interview with the author, Benha, 26 February 2006.
4 The rhetoric of religious authority
1 The following presentation relies mainly on Gudrun Krämer’s article ‘Drawing bound-
aries: YÙsuf al-QaraÃÁwÐ on apostasy’ (Krämer 2006) and Wendelin Wenzel-Teuber’s
monograph Islamische Ethik und moderne Gesellschaft im Islamismus von Yusuf al-
184 Notes
Qaradawi (Wenzel-Teuber 2005). In addition, there is a section on him in Salvatore
(1997: 201–209), which places his discourse in the context of a study of Islam and the
political discourse of modernity in broad terms.
2 Ikhwanweb.com (2006) ‘Qaradawi: MB asked me to be a chairman’, 5 September.
Online. Available: http://www.ikhwanweb.com/Article.asp?ID=3537&SectionID=81
(accessed 19 February 2008).
3 However, Kate Zebiri’s study of MaÎmÙd ShaltÙt (1993: 44) suggests that ShaltÙt was in
fact the one who first used the term in a modern sense.
4 Its Web site is found at http://www.e-cfr.org/en/.
5 This is not an uncommon phenomenon in Modern Written Arabic. In her recent study
of spoken academic Arabic in Egypt, Gunvor Mejdell terms it ‘contextually determined
modal meaning of [Standard Arabic] “indicative” (unmarked) imperfect’, and comments
on the lack of attention that has been given to this phenomenon in Arabic linguistics
(Mejdell 2006: 133–134).
6 In translating this verse, which is often cited in religious works in the context of ÝAÞisha’s
lament about the bad times in which she lived, I have combined Arthur Wormhoudt’s
English translation (Wormhoudt 1976: 21–22) with Huber’s and Brockelmann’s German
one (Brockelmann 1891: XIII), owing to the former’s poor rendering of the second bayt.
I thank Amund Bjørsnøs for his generous help in locating the poem the verse is taken
from and for finding and discussing the translations with me.
5 The rhetoric of religious passion
1 ÝAmr KhÁlid later expanded his engagement, and his Web site now contains a multi-
lingual section on the topic: http://www.amrkhaled.net/acategories/categories170.html
(accessed 6 October 2009).
2 Reported in al-Mis
.r al-yawm, 8 January 2008, p. 4.
3 This newspaper not only featured a sympathetic, comprehensive interview on 22
March 2006, but also published in print the first programme in ÝAmr KhÁlid’s TV series
‘Al khut
. al-h
.abb on 5 April 2006.
4 al-Dustr, 22 March 2006, p. 11.
5 Interview with the author, Cairo, 21 November 2006.
6 Apparently, this practice has well-known precedents. Writing about shaykhs ShaÝrÁwÐ
and Kishk, J. Jansen notes that Kishk’s books were dictated, and that ShaÝrÁwÐ’s TV ser-
mons, lectures and even interviews, which were given partly or wholly in dialect, were
adapted to book format. See Jansen (1986: 95, 122–123).
7 An interesting aspect of the title is that it seems to redefine the concepts of ‘ibra and
‘iz
.a. In his well-researched study of Islamic preaching, Halldén (2001: 47) defines these
as ‘stern, admonishing sermons, often about subjects like death, resurrection and the Day
of Judgment’. In contrast, ÝAmr KhÁlid’s ‘iz
.a is definitely on the bright side, although
with plenty of passion, and it treats a number of different subjects.
8 Author interview with NabÐl ÝAbd al-FattÁÎ at the al-Ahram Centre for Political and
Strategic Studies in Cairo, 13 February 2006.
9 See Wise (2003: 13–16) for a description of a typical ÝAmr KhÁlid show.
6 The rhetoric of religious polemics
1 Abaza refers to his articles on the subject which has come to be called the ‘Islamization of
science’. For more on ÝImÁra’s role in this particular area of Islamism, see Abaza (2002).
2 See http://www.amrkhaled.net/acategories/categories183.html (accessed 26 February
2010).
3 My own material covers the nine years between 1995 and 2004, and his positions and
style here are essentially the same. Other research corroborates this impression. Abaza
Notes 185
(1999: 99–100) writes that ‘[r]eading Immara [sic] (especially in his late Islamist phase
of the eighties and nineties) one finds his terminology has become a patchwork of
nationalist, Marxist, and Islamist jargon combined with a strong denunciation and hatred
towards secular and Marxist intellectuals.’
4 The vocalization here seems to be a misprint, since ‘mifÒal’is a rather rare word meaning
‘tongue’. ‘MafÒil’, lit.: ‘joint of a limb’, is probably what is intended.
5 In fact these sentences suggest that Holes’s categorization is incomplete. According to
him, this type of conditional sentence invariably has kÁna + imperfect aspect in the prota-
sis. However, as the excerpts here show, the protasis can consist also of kÁna + perfect
aspect or even kÁna + nominal sentence, while the meaning of the conditional sentence
– ‘given that ... then’ – remains the same.
6 The concept of taqld merits some comments, since it carries powerful connotations
and is often referred to by ÝImÁra. The word is central in the Islamic religious sciences,
and, as Norman Calder writes, it has the meaning of ‘acceptance of or submission to
authority’ (Calder 2009). It was not necessarily used pejoratively in the classical Islamic
literature, but in today’s religious parlance it is invariably invoked to label intellectual
antagonists as blind imitators of past and irrelevant religious authorities. Accusations of
taqld are often levelled at conservative salafists; ÝImÁra uses the term creatively to add
rhetorical force to his warning against ‘imitating’ the West; cf. the quotation at the very
beginning of this chapter.
7 As an aside, it can be noted that MuÎammad ÝImÁra studiously avoids any suggestion
that it is Islamic thought he must defend. Instead, he cites as the reason for writing the
book the modern Muslim’s confusion when presented with the contradictions between
authentic Islamic thought and the attempts at distorting it that come from outside. See
ÝImÁra (2000: 23).
8 Note, however, that nominalization is a natural and important part of written language in
general, both in English and in Arabic. I am thus not implying that MuÎammad ÝImÁra
consciously tries to mystify his propositions, but merely that this is the objective effect
of nominalization, and that it acquires ideological import in this specific context.
7 Rhetoric and religious ideology
1 In his article about Arabic and English argumentation, Basil Hatim (1991: 195) makes a
more nuanced claim about Arabic persuasive prose in general: that a balanced counter-
argument structure is ‘almost exclusively found in the discourse of Western-educated
literate Arabs and those versed in classical Arabic rhetoric’. The claim sounds likely to
be correct, but Hatim does not provide any evidence to prove it.
2 He reiterated the claim that there is no clergy during one of the programmes in the ‘al-
SharÐÝa wa-l-ÎayÁ’ series on al-JazÐra (27 January 2008). The show was about chaos in
religious proselytizing and, though asserting that there is no clergy in Islam, YÙsuf al-
QaraÃÁwÐ stressed that each discipline has its experts, and that religious discourse should
be left to those who are educated in it.
