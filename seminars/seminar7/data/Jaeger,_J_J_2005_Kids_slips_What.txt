KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 9
At this point the 'Functional Level Representation' undergoes a linear
ordering in the 'Selection of Syntactic Templates' and 'Assignment of Content
Lemmas to Syntagmatic Positions' components. Syntactic templates
appropriate to the proposition and discourse are selected from the stored
morphosyntactic representations (Van Valin & LaPolla 1997:432). These
templates contain slots where particular types of function morphemes should
occur, and function morphemes will be activated from the 'Function Lexicon' to
fill those slots. The selection of the correct function morphemes will be
governed by several things: requirements of the selected content morphemes
(e.g. specific verbs require particular prepositions), requirements of the syntactic
template (e.g. the passive construction requires particular verb morphology), and
the tense/aspect requirements of the proposition (e.g. past perfective
morphology). The 'Functional Level Representation' is linked to the selected
syntactic template, following processes like the 'linking algorithms' of Van
Valin & LaPolla (1997: Ch. 7), where thematic roles are assigned specific
syntactic functions based on both language-specific and universal principles.
Content word lemmas are then assigned to slots in the syntactic string based on
their assigned functions in the 'Functional Level Representations'. During this
linear ordering process, the 'Assignment of Intonational Contours' component
assigns the correct intonational melody for the proposition, the syntactic frame,
and the pragmatic intention of the utterance; it is specifically sensitive to the
focus or information structure of the sentence, and the type of speech act. This
requires a partial activation of the 'Phonology' representations, specifically
elements relevant to the phonology-syntax interface.
After the lemmas of both content and function words and morphemes have
been linearized, the 'Form' representations of each lemma are retrieved from the
form lexicon and replace the more abstract lemmas in the linear string, for both
content and function morphemes. The 'form' representation of each lexical entry
is assumed to include phonological and morphological information about that
word, as well as orthographic information where relevant. The morphological
representations of lexical entries are taken to contain information regarding the
morphological make-up of the word. Derivationally complex words,
compounds, and irregularly inflected forms are assumed to be stored whole, with
some information about the individual morphemes which make up the word
stored in the lexical entry (see Chapters 4 and 6 for details). Regular inflectional
affixes are not stored in content lexical entries, but have autonomous entries in
the form lexicon and are concatenated with content morphemes during linear
ordering. Phonological representations are assumed to be something like those
represented in Autosegmental Phonology (or some connectionist models); i.e.
there are various tiers of phonological units (or nodes), linked together by
association lines, which function to some extent autonomously; prosodic
structure, syllable structure, segments, and phonetic features are important parts
of each phonological representation, and there is both feed-forward and feed-back
among levels of representation.
10 KIDS' SLIPS
In the RPC Model, the 'lemma lexicon' and the 'form lexicon' are treated as
if they are two separate but related entities, similar to the 'generic 2-stage model'
of Harley & Brown (1998). This distinction is supported by the
psycholinguistic facts gleaned from SOT research, since each aspect of the
lexicon is activated and processed at distinct points during processing, and is
involved in different types of errors. An interesting issue which will recur
throughout this book is just how the two subdivisions of the lexicon are linked,
that is, what kinds of feed-forward and feed-backward links there are between the
two aspects of the lexical representation for a single lexical entry.
The output of the 'Retrieval of Forms' component is the 'Phonological
Level Representation', which consists of a string of (abstract, or partially
unspecified) phonological representations in the correct linear order, with
syntactic constituent structure specified, and with the general intonational
melody indicated. This representation is fed into the 'Phonological Processes'
component while the speaker's representation for 'Phonology', i.e, their
knowledge about the phonological structures and processes of their language, is
activated. In this component the phonological rules of the language assign the
correct phonetic form to the more abstract phonological units in the 'form'
representation, given the syntagmatic and prosodic structure of the utterance; this
is done on a phrase-by-phrase basis. Productive phonological (e.g. allophonic)
and morphophonemic processes take place during assignment of phonetic form.
The output of this component is the 'Phonetic Level Representation', which is a
fully specified phonetic representation of the utterance, and is the last element in
the 'Speech Production Planning' process. This representation is sent to the
'Motor Planning' component, i.e. the motor areas of the brain, for neural motor
encoding, and from there to the actual articulators, in syllable-by-syllable
increments, for 'Speaking'. Errors which occur in the components from
'Inferential Processes' through 'Phonological Processes' which involve planning
per se are considered SOTs; however errors which occur during speaking itself
(i.e. hesitations, slurrings, etc.) or for pragmatic reasons (e.g. false starts) are not
considered part of the planning process and hence are not SOTs. In ยง104.5
below, after the presentation of my SOT taxonomy, I will refer back to this
model in order to link specific error types to erroneous processing in specific
components of the model.
One final element of the RPC Model is the self-monitoring system (not
included in Figure 1.1). I assume (with Laver 1980 and many others) that there
are two distinct monitors which serve to filter out erroneous utterances, either
before they are uttered or immediately after the utterance is produced. The first is
an 'internal' monitor, which screens the final output of the planning mechanism
for legality; that is, its role is to filter out any non-legal speech sounds,
phonotactic sequences, nonsense words, or ungrammatical strings, before the
utterance is produced. The existence of this internal monitor would explain why
non-legal speech sounds and violations of phonotactic sequences are extremely
rare in SOTs (Boomer & Laver 1973, Fromkin 1973a), and why phonological
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 11
errors are likely to produce real words, at least for adults (Baars, Motley &
MacKay 1975, Dell & Reich 1981); it may also explain the rarity of true phrase
blends. Strong evidence for the internal monitor comes from studies by Motley
and Baars (Baars, Motley & Mackay 1975, Motley 1980). In these studies,
subjects were induced via the 'SLIPS' technique to produce speech errors which
would result in the production of words or phrases which were slightly
embarrassing or risque. In these cases subjects would often catch themselves
before they spoke the error aloud. but would blush and look embarrassed because
of what they had been about to say. These studies attest to the existence of an
internal monitor which scans planned output prior to speaking.
However, luckily for us. this internal monitor is far from perfect. and
erroneously planned utterances can fool the monitor and be spoken aloud,
producing SOTs. At this point a second monitor, the 'external' monitor. comes
into play. This monitor consists of the auditory feedback loop; that is, speakers
are usually listening to what they are saying. and if they hear an error (i.e. their
utterance is at odds with their intention) they have the option of correcting it.
One interesting question which will be addressed below is the relative efficiency
of children's monitors compared to adults' .
1.3 The Current Study: MethodolQ2Y
1.3.1 How Can We Tell a Child Has Made A Slip?
As discussed above, there are obvious methodological difficulties involved
in detecting SOTs made by very young children. since children regularly produce
utterances which differ from adult productions of the same target. In most cases
these productions reflect the child's current stage of development. and are
systematic substitutions or omissions of the types thoroughly documented in the
acquisition literature (e.g. Ingram 1986). However. the studies cited above have
shown that SOTs can be distinguished from systematic 'rules' which govern
children's immature productions. In the cases where errors are collected in
spontaneous settings. the researcher knows the child's current system of
production thoroughly. and recognizes that a particular utterance was at odds with
the usual production. The errors frequently are of a type which differ
significantly from typical systematic substitutions or mutations. Furthermore.
children frequently look confused and/or correct their error in the same way that
adults do after making a slip. Consider the following example:
(1) B: 'Mommy, more cheese-puffs.' (a type of snack food)
M: 'No, you've had enough.'
B: '[tJ..tApc]! ... cheese-puffs!'
(for 'cheese-puffs' [tl.pApC]. adult model [tflz.phAfs]; B-28(l2) 1;11)
Before discussing this example, my notational conventions need to be
explicated. In errors given as examples, the 'error' units (erroneous production)
12 KIDS' SLIPS
are in boldface; the 'source' (source of the interference) is in boldface italics; and
the 'target' (the intended production) is underlined. So, in example (1), the first
[t] in 'cheese-puffs' (bold-italics) is the source of the error; the second et] (bold)
is the error itself; the [p] in the corrected utterance (underlined) is the target (i.e.
intended) segment.
In the child errors, speakers are identified as follows: An=Anna, AI=Alice,
B=Bobby, Me-the child's mother, De-thechild's father, OB=other boy, OG=other
girl, OA=other adult. The notation at the end of the example should be read as
follows: 1) Identification of data set and error number: AN=Anna, AL=Alice,
B=Bobby, OC=other child. 2) The taxonomic class of the error (in parentheses
after the error number); the classification system is given in Table 1.2 below, as
well as at the beginning of the data section of this book. 3) The age of the child
when the error was made, in 'years;months'; in the data section of this book the
days are also given (i.e. years;months.days). Thus the error in (1) should be
interpreted as follows: Bobby requests more cheese-puffs, his mother responds
negatively, and then Bobby reiterates that he wants cheese-puffs, and makes an
error in this utterance (which will be discussed below). The notation after the
error should be read as follows: Subject: Bobby-error #28 (class 12, phonological
perseverations, substitutions, consonants) age: one year; eleven months. A
guide to phonetic symbols used can be found at the beginning of the data section
of the book. In most cases in the text, the error will be presented in an
abbreviated form, focussing only on the relevant structures; however, the full
error is always given in the data section of the book. Finally, in the data section
of the book I have indicated after each error where in the text this error has been
discussed, if relevant. Thus in the text, if an example is repeated I will usually
not indicate that it is 'repeated from above', since this information is available in
the data section.
At the age at which he made the 'cheese-puffs' error, Bobby regularly
realized the six adult phonemes Ip,bl, lt,dJ, and /k,gl as the three voiceless
unaspirated stops [p], et], [k] respectively, and systematically differentiated the
three places of articulation. Adult If1was realized as [p], and syllable-initial /tS/
as [t], while all word-final sibilants were pronounced as [cl; all but word-final
sequences of consonants were reduced to single consonants. In this example, in
the first utterance Bobby pronounced 'cheese-puffs' in his usual way, [t1.pAp<;;];
then when he repeated it in his second utterance, the et] from 'cheese' [ti] was
perseverated and substituted for the initial [p] in 'puffs' [pxpc]: the child then
noticed his error and corrected it to his usual pronunciation. So one can see the
erroneous production flanked on both sides by the 'correct' pronunciation for this
word, that is, Bobby's usual pronunciation of this word at age 1;11. The
substitution of et] for [p] was not a regular substitution for this child but
represented a one-time error which violated his usual pronunciation of this word;
furthermore the regular substitution of et] for [p] is not common in early child
phonology, since [p] and et] are usually among the first segments systematically
produced correctly by children. Therefore there is enough evidence to conclude
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCE FOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 13
that this was indeed a one-time SOT.
A few more examples will strengthen the argument.
(2) a. OG: (looking at toothbrush; no toothpaste in view)
'My toothpaste ... my toothbrush.'
(substitution of 'toothpaste' for 'toothbrush'; OC-6(35) 2;0)
b. An: (pretending to talk on the phone to "Winnie the Pooh" characters)
'HI [th
).glt].'
(blend of'Tigger' [th
f.g3 ] and 'Piglet' [p'I.qrt]: AN-6(38) 1;7)
c. AI: 'Daddy, me watching Daddy cooking .. . no . . . M6mmy's
cooking.'
('Daddy' perseverated, substituted for 'Mommy'; AL-27(43) 2;4)
d. B: (ready to walk to store) 'Mom, l wanna g6ing ... I going
too!' (blend of 'I wanna go' and 'I going too'; B-37(49) 2;1)
In (2a), the child regularly differentiated the words 'toothpaste' and 'toothbrush',
but in this instance she selected the incorrect word, and then corrected herself. In
(2b), Anna knew both the words 'Tigger' and 'Piglet', but during this pretend
conversation she accidentally blended the two names. Alice, in error (2c),
perseverated the word 'Daddy' and substituted it for 'Mommy'. Upon noticing
the error she corrected herself and laughed at her mistake; she also changed the
phrasal stress pattern and (very slightly) the syntax in order to emphasize the
correction. Finally, in (2d), Bobby was able to correctly produce the two target
syntactic structures at this time, but in this case he blended the two, correcting
the utterance which he considered to be ungrammatical into one of the targets.
Although this target, 'I going too', is ungrammatical by adult standards, it was
a regular structure in Bobby's grammar at the time, and so was not
ungrammatical by his standards.
In sum, an utterance made by a child is analyzed as containing a SOT if it
includes a production which is at odds with the child's current grammar, either in
terms of phonology, lexicon, morphology, or syntax. Frequently, after a SOT
is made, the child looks confused, and/or corrects the utterance, which is further
evidence that the child considered it an error.
On the other hand, many of the children's productions which differ from the
adult model are simply a function of the child not having yet learned that
linguistic structure. A systematic substitution of one phoneme for another
(exemplified in example (1) above, where Bobby systematically substituted
voiceless unaspirated plosives for all plosives and some fricatives), the misuse of
a word, the meaning of which the child is unsure of, or the regular use of a non-
adult syntactic construction are not SOTs. Similarly, fluctuations in usage
while a child masters a structure are also not slips (see Stemberger 1989 for a
careful discussion of this point). Consider the following examples.
14 KIDS'SLIPS
(3) a. An: 'Look! Alice!' (pointing at a picture of "Baby Beluga" in a book)
M: 'Yeah, I already showed it to her yesterday.'
An: 'Alice, come here! Look at this!'
AI: 'Anna, she already showed me tomorrow!'
An: (laughs) 'Yesterday!'
AI: 'Yesterday.' (Alice, age 3;5; Anna age 5;9)
b. AI: 'Mamma, I wanted to watch Gene Kelly, but I just got into bed
and goeded to sleep.' (pronounced [g6w.f~d]; age 3;5)
c. M: 'Don't touch my tummy.'
AI: 'Yeah, that's prlvace.' (pronounced [ph~aj.V~s]; age 3;3)
d. An: (being a magician) 'And now I will appear my assistant, right
under this table.' (age 5;6)
In (3a), Alice substituted the word 'tomorrow' for 'yesterday'; however, this was
not a SOT, since she did not have the meanings of these words clearly
distinguished, and was fluctuating between the two randomly at the time . In
(3b), she produced an overregularized version of the past tense of 'go'; i.e. rather
than 'went' she added the regular past tense suffix to 'go', producing 'goed', then
double marked it by adding the suffix again, now requiring the syllabic form,
producing 'goeded'. This was an overgeneralization she was making regularly at
this time, and not a one-time SOT. In (3c), Alice had created the word 'privace',
meaning 'private', as a back-formation from 'privacy'; for a short time she
refused to pronounce it any other way. Finally, in (3d), Anna produced the verb
'appear' as if it were a causative (i.e. 'cause to appear'), which is a well-
documented type of overextension common to the early speech of many English-
speaking children (Bowerman 1974). Such examples were carefully noted in
my journal entries as 'not a slip', and they will not be found in the corpus at the
end of this book.
Finally, as mentioned above, there are a number of types of incomplete
utterances which are not considered SOTs per se (see Levelt 1989: Ch. 12, and
Wells-Jensen 1999:83-94 for thorough discussions of this point). These include
false starts with re-starts, where the speaker changes his/her mind about the
propositianal content, lexical selection, or form of the utterance, and then plans
and speaks a new utterance before the originally planned utterance is completed.
This is illustrated in (4).
(4) AI: 'Look at what .. . What Anna gave me is a flashlight.' (age 3;8)
In this utterance, Alice started to say something like 'Look at what Anna gave
me', but changed her mind and re-started the utterance with a different
prepositional content and syntax. Other types of utterances not counted as SOTs
include what Wells-Jensen calls 'discourse anomalies' (1999:89), where, for
example, a child uses pronouns in a confusing manner because he/she has lost
โข
track of the discourse reference. Finally, stutterings, slurred speech, and other
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 15
motor dysfluencies are not considered SOTs as they are not caused by
dysfunction of the speech production planning mechanism; they are rather
caused by a problem in sending messages from the 'Motor Planning' component
to the articulators themselves.
These are the basic principles involved in data collection; specific details
regarding different types of errors and subjects will be discussed below.
1.3.2 Subjects
The majority of data analyzed in the present study were collected by me from
my three children, Anna, Alice, and Bobby, when they were between the ages of
1;7-5;11. During this time period I kept diaries of all three children's language
development, such that the SOTs were situated within a record of their
synchronous normal productions. Further data were collected from 57 'Other'
children, 29 girls and 28 boys, ages 1;10-5;11. All errors were collected by ear,
in naturalistic settings; errors were recorded in a notebook immediately after they
occurred, in both orthography and phonetic transcription, including information
about discourse context, previous and subsequent utterances, and physical context
when relevant. Age 6 was chosen as the cut-off point for this study partly to
minimize any effect of literacy , but mainly to focus on errors made by very
young children as their primary linguistic abilities were developing. Errors
were collected from Other children in order to verify that the data collected from
my three children were not in some sense anomalous, i.e. that such errors are
produced only by children who have two linguist parents. I found no qualitative
differences between the data collected from my children and the Other children;
quantitative differences will be discussed in detail below. I will refer to the data
collected from Anna, Alice, Bobby, and Other children as the four 'data sets' of
this study.
Many of the Other errors were collected in a preschool setting, where I
observed a group of 2-5-year-olds for approximately one hour, two days per
week, for six weeks. Some Other errors were collected from my children's
friends and cousins whose speech patterns I knew well, particularly during the
age range of 3-5 years, such that their grammars were not greatly different from
the adult models. Although I personally collected the great majority of errors, a
few of the Other errors in my corpus were collected by my graduate students
from their own children; these students were well trained in both phonetics and
the study of SOTs, and their data are highly reliable. A few of the errors came
from professional colleagues who collected these errors from their own children.
My corpus of child errors numbers 1,383. Table 1.1 shows the number of
errors contributed to the corpus by each data set at each age, from 1 to 5 years,
and the percentage of errors at each age originating from each data set. This table
is to be read as follows (for example): at age 1, I collected 22 SOTs from Anna;
this represents 38.5% of the age 1 errors in my corpus. Overall, Anna
contributed 338 (24.5%) of the errors in the corpus. It can be seen that at each
age there are very different proportions of errors contributed by each data set; I

will discuss this factor in more detail below.
In Table 1.1 I have divided the data by age. However, in a few cases in this
study I will separate out errors made when the subjects were in the 1- or 2-word
vs. 3+word (i.e. telegraphic and beyond) speech stages, rather than by strict
chronological age, when this distinction is important to the issue under study.
The approximate ages at which my three children were making SOTs while in
each of these stages are given in Table 1.2. Anna, who was an 'expressive'
language learner (see 1.5.2 below), didn't go through obvious stages; she spoke
in whole phrases from the time when her earliest SOTs were recorded, including
fixed phrases such as nursery rhymes, mixed with jargon babbling. Alice, who
was a more 'referential' style learner, did go through a clear l-word stage, from
1;0-1;10; however, I did not collect any errors from her during this time, and her
first SOT was collected after she had entered the 2-word stage (at age 2;0).
However I collected several errors from Bobby, another <referential' learner, while
he was in the I-word and 2-word stages. My corpus also includes several errors
from Other children made in these early stages. Errors made in the l-word or
2-word stages are marked as such in the database; all errors without these
designations were made when the speaker was producing utterances of 3 or more
words.
1.3.3 Specific Methodological Issues Regarding Data Collection
There are three types of problems which need to be considered when
collecting SOT data, particularly from children. The first one has to do with the
'pencil-and-paper' method of collection. It is frequently said (Nooteboom 1980,
Cutler 1982a, Ferber 1991, Poulisse 1999, ยง5.2) that there is a perceptual bias
which makes certain types of errors easier to detect than others; for example,
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 17
TABLE 1.2
Chronological ages for language development stages of the three main
subjects, during the period when SOTs were collected.
Stage: I-word 2-word 3+word
Anna na na 1~7 -->
Alice na 2;0 -- 2;1.20 2;1.20 -->
Bobby 1;7 -- 1;8.30 1;9.0--1;11.20 1;11.20-->
word or syllable errors are said to be easier to hear than phoneme errors, and
anticipations are perceived more readily than perseverations. I think it is
interesting that in every naturalistic corpus I have encountered, the 'difficult-to-
hear' phonological errors always outnumber other types of errors; thus it is
possible that these biases are somewhat overstated (see Poulisse 1999:9 for a list
of corpora in which this is true). Furthermore, in languages other than English
and other Germanic languages (e.g. Thai, Mandarin, Japanese, Spanish, Hindi),
anticipations and perseverations tend to be collected in equal numbers (see, for
example, Wan 1999, Wells-Jensen 1999, Muansuwan 2000, Kawachi 2002), so
that in languages where they are produced in equal numbers, they seem to be
perceived as such. (The abundance of anticipations in Germanic languages is
probably due to prosodic and information structure causes; see ยง3.7.3 below.)
Certainly these possible biases should cause researchers to be cautious about
making definitive statements about the quantity of specific types of errors (see
ยง1.5.3 below). However, in order to be able to make some quantitative
statements in comparison to adult data, I have collected an additional set of 716
errors from adults (including teenagers; adults in the study ranged from 13-75), to
use as a control corpus. Although many corpora of errors from adult speakers of
English currently exist, I felt that a corpus collected by the same researcher,
using the same methodology and classification system, would be the best data to
use for comparison with the child data. In this case any perceptual biases
attributable to the researcher would be evenly distributed across the two corpora.
Furthermore, many of the adult errors in my corpus were collected from adults in
the three main subjects' immediate family (including their parents, grandparents,
aunts, and uncles), so they represent the target language which the children were
learning. In fact, because the child data reported in this book were collected
during the years of 1983-1991, the three main child subjects actually contributed
most of the 'teenage' errors in the adult corpus; thus the child data are being
compared to errors made by the same subjects at a later age, in several cases.
Although the data I collected will be the primary source of adult data used for
comparison to the child data, I will also compare the children's errors with
published analyses of adult errors where appropriate.
18 KIDS' SLIPS
The second type of methodological issue is the accuracy with which young
children's errors can be perceived, given considerations of age, error type, and
type of utterance containing the error. A further factor is how well-known the
child is to the data collector. In Jaeger (l992a) I documented the guidelines I
used for collecting data of different types from the various subjects, which I will
reiterate here.
First, any error in a set-phrase such as a phrase from a nursery rhyme or
word game, was very easy to detect for all subjects, especially since children tend
to repeat these phrases many times, giving much evidence as to their normal
forms. An example is given in (5). Many of the very early errors collected were
in such phrases. These set-phrases become automatic very early, and so are
among the earliest candidates for SOTs.
(5) B: '[pu.ka.pn.]' (for 'peek-a-boo' [pi.ka.pu.] ; B-7(5) 1;9)
In this error, Bobby intended to produce the set-phrase 'peek-a-boo' as part of the
hiding game, but erroneously anticipated the vowel [u] from the third syllable
and substituted it for the vowel [i] in the first syllable.
Second, as with adult errors, word-based errors were readily noticeable, as
they either consisted of one known word substituted for another known word as
in (2a) above, or of two known words blended together as in (2b) above. These
types of errors were also noticed by the children and self-corrected more often
than any other type of error; this was equally true of data from my own children
as from the Other group (see ยง2.4). Therefore lexical errors from Other children
may be disproportionately high in my corpus, as I relied more heavily on self-
correction in order to verify SOTs in Other children than in my own children.
Third, it is clear that accuracy in detecting phonological errors (i.e. errors
involving features, segments, sub-syllabic units, syllables, and prosody) depends
on the data collector's knowledge of a child's current phonology. I was able to
collect phonological errors from my three children with confidence, as was the
case with errors collected by my graduate students from their own children.
Collecting phonological errors from Other children involved familiarizing myself
with individual speech patterns, especially with the very young children, which I
was able to do satisfactorily in the preschool setting. In fact it was usually not
difficult to distinguish phonological SOTs from systematic substitutions made
by Other children; this was due to a combination of my familiarity with their
systems, frequent self-correction, and the fact that these errors often violate the
type of phonetic relationships usually found in systematic phonological
substitutions due to an immature phonology.
Fourth, the most difficult errors to collect were those which involved syntax
and morphology, where the child did not correct his/her utterance. For my own
children I checked uncorrected possible SOTs against journal entries documenting
their current syntactic and morphological patterns, and verified that the utterance
was at odds with their normal rules. For the Other children it was more difficult
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 19
to verify their current syntactic and morphological systems, and so recording
these errors relied to some extent on spontaneous self-correction. Again it was
not as difficult to distinguish Other children's SOTs from their current immature
grammars as one might expect, because such errors as phrase blends and word
reversals usually result in structures which would be extremely unusual as a
systematic pattern based on the child's current immature grammar (see example
(2d) above). However, I did not include a potential error of any type in my
corpus unless 1 had heard enough of the child's speech to have some verification
that the utterance in question represented a deviation from the child's normal
production (see also the discussion of example (26) in Chapter 3).
The third type of methodological problem is the issue of whether or not the
children in the study could have become consciously aware of the focus of my
data collection, and may have been intentionally producing anomalous utterances
for Mom' s benefit. I am often asked this question, although I find it a little odd
since this is a question rarely asked of researchers collecting data from adult
subjects, and it presupposes that speakers (in this case 1-5-year-old children) can
intentionally create SOTs which sound natural enough to fool a seasoned
researcher. (Naturally, when the children decided to pronounce the word
'spaghetti' [spc.qe.ri] as 'busgetti' [po.ske.ri] for a few months, I did not count
this as a SOT.) However, I did scan my notes for any hint that the children had
any metalinguistic awareness of the phenomenon under study. Bobby seems to
be the only child who was actually aware of the term 'speech error', since in two
cases (at ages 4;11 and 5;1) he commented that he had 'made a speech error' after
his external monitor caught the slip; one is given in (6); see also (B-429(35)
4;11).
(6) B: (explaining why he should be first in the bathtub tonight)
'Because I was last forest] mght. (laughs) I made a speech
error.' (for 'I was last last night'; B-458(1) 5;1)
In (6) Bobby anticipates the onset [n] from 'night' and substitutes it for the
onset [I] in 'last'. It was quite common for the children (and adults) to comment
on their own errors, either just before the repair (e.g. '1 mean') or just after it ('I
should say'); this will be discussed in detail in Chapter 2. Bobby's comment on
his 'speech error' is analogous to the following comment from Anna, where she
uses the terminology 'mistake'.
(7) An: (peeling apple slices; no bananas in sight)
'I'm peeling my bananas. (laughs) Oh, I made a mistake. I said
"bananas" instead of "apples".' (AN-208(35) 4;5)
Making a comment on an error was common among the Other children as well
as among adults, and so these comments are unlikely to reflect any special
knowledge of the SOT phenomenon among my children. However, one
20 KIDS' SLIPS
contribution made by Bobby is good evidence that the children would have been
unable to construct speech errors even if they had tried. One evening when
Bobby was 5;7, the children's father was joking around about speech errors (to
my chagrin) and engaged Bobby in the following conversation.
(8) D: 'What's a speech error?'
B: 'You know! Can I do one please Mom?'
M: 'OK'
B: 'Cake-coffee. That's one, 'cuz it's supposed to be "coffee-cake".'
So, at age 5;7 Bobby was consciously aware that one type of utterance that
counts as a speech error is the metathesis of the two content stems in a
compound. However notice that in his constructed error he carried the lexical
stress with the two words when he metathesized them. In all of my naturally
collected SOTs involving metathesis within a compound, the stress remained in
the originally planned locations; so in a natural speech error the utterance would
have been 'cake-coffee', since in this case one would expect that the compound
stress would remain intact. Therefore this example shows that Bobby most
likely would not have been able to intentionally construct a SOT, and if he had
been trying to do it on purpose I'm quite sure I would have been able to
distinguish it from a naturally occurring error. The two girls showed no signs of
having any conscious awareness of the phenomenon during the study, and of
course the Other children had no metalinguistic awareness of SOTs. Looking at
this question from another angle, there is no evidence that metalinguistic
awareness of SOTs has any affect on natural speech production one way or the
other. Many of the adults in my study were very consciously and intimately
aware of SOTs (in particular, myself), but produced them naturally, without
intentionality or contrivance. in great abundance. Therefore metalinguistic
awareness is unlikely to have had any influence on either my child or adult data,
either by facilitating or inhibiting SOT production.
After collecting the data. I divided the data into the five data sets โขAnna,
Alice, Bobby, Other Child, Adult'. I assigned numbers to each error
consecutively according to age in each of the four child data sets. For my three
children this means that their errors are numbered in.the order in which they
occurred. For the 'Other' data set, the different children's errors were combined
into one age-ranked list (the individual children are identified only as 'male' or
'female'), and assigned consecutive numbers based on age; when the utterance
included a proper name, this name was changed to protect the confidentiality of
the child, unless the proper name itself was involved in the error. The adult
errors were simply numbered consecutively in the order they appear in the data
set; that is, the first error presented is error AD-I, and the last error in the corpus
is AD-700 (see next section for why the last error is AD-700 and not AD-716).
Notation used in the adult data include: AD=adult, AF=adult female, AM=adult
male, TF=teen female, TM=teen male.
KIDS' SUPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 21
All errors were assigned to a specific error class according to the criteria
given in the following section. When more than one error occurred in the same
utterance, the errors were subscripted as (a), (b), (c); for example (only the errors
are highlighted):
(9) An: (chanting nursery rhyme)
'Mommy called the doctor and the mommy [k'ed] . . .
Momrny [khel.d~] doctor, and the doctor said ...
Mommy called the doctor and the doctor said:
No more monkeys jumpin' on the bed!'
There are three errors in this utterance. The first is in the first line , which
should have been 'Mommy called the doctor and the doctor said'; however, Anna
substituted 'mommy' for 'doctor'; this error is listed in Class 43 as AN-26a.
The second error is in the last word of the first line; Anna meant to say 'said',
but the /kJ from 'called' was perseverated and substituted for the [s] in 'said', so
she pronounced it *[khEd]; this error is listed in Class 12 as AN-26b. The third
error occurs in the second line, where she intended to say 'called', but the vowel
from 'said' was perseverated and substituted for the vowel in 'called', producing
*[khEl]; this error is listed in Class 5 as AN-26c. (These classes will be
explained in detail in ยง1.4 below.) This utterance was made at age 2;1.23 (two
years, one month, 23 days). Because in some cases there were two or even three
errors included under the same number, there are more errors than numbers. In
the adult data there are 16 cases where a numbered utterance includes more than
one error, so the highest numbered adult error is AD-700 rather than AD-716.
The children's last entries are as follows: Anna, AN-330(35) 5;11.30; Alice,
AL-270(38) 5;11.31; Bobby, B-588(13) 5;11.26; Other, OC-174(38) 5;11.31.
lA Classification System
The system used in this study for classifying errors was developed from
traditional systems used for classifying adult errors in English, and makes use of
the following three dimensions: 1) the linguistic component or stage involved
in the error, 2) the directionality of the error, and 3) the form of the error. In
the following section I will first present a discussion of these three factors,
giving examples from the children's data. I will then discuss how classifications
were made in ambiguous cases, indicating the decision-making procedures I used
in a broad range of cases . At the end of this section I will review the RPC
Model discussed in ยง1.2 above, showing how the various types of errors can
arise given dysfunctions in specific locations in the model.
I go into minute methodological detail in this section for two reasons.
First, this will allow readers to interpret the classifications I have made of the
data presented in this book, and if they disagree with my classification system,
they can reclassify errors according to their own systems. Second, I intend for
these details to be useful to researchers wanting to utilize the SOT methodology
22 KIDS'SLIPS
in their own work, particularly with young children. Naturally the classification
system will need somerevising if the data are being collected in a language other
than English, which contains different types or different proportions of linguistic
units (e.g. has much more morphology; see Wells-Jensen 1999).
1.4.1 Linguistic Components Involved in Errors
Errors can occur at any stage of the speech production planning model, but
they can be broadly grouped into four classes of error based on what type of
linguistic unit was the locus of the misplanning. These classes are:
Phonological, Lexical, Syntactic, and Propositional. Phonological errors are
those which occur during the assignment of phonetic form and involve non-
meaningful phonological units or prosody. Lexical errors are those which occur
as lexical items are being activated and selected, and include paradigmatic lexical
substitutions and blends. Syntactic errors are those which occur during the
planning of the functional and linear structure of sentences, and include
misplacements of lexical items and phrase blends. Finally, propositional errors
are those where a speaker fluently produces an utterance which is at odds with the
overall meaning he or she intended to convey.
Phonological errors are those which involve phonological units which do
not carry semantic content (i.e. are not morphemes): phonetic features, segments
(consonants or vowels), sub-syllabic sequences of segments (consonant clusters,
rhymes, etc.), syllables, and lexical stress. The cause of an intonational error
can be syntactic or pragmatic; however, because they always , involve
phonological (pitch) units, they are classified as phonological here, although
they might be better thought of as syntactic in some cases. Because there are
only 3 intonation errors in the child data and 5 in the adult data, their
classification as 'phonological' vs. 'syntactic' does not have a large effect on the
overall pattern of errors. The following examples are given in abbreviated form.
(10) Phonological units involved in errors
a. Features: AI: 'I made a? [a~tJ1 ... [~tI ph~a.dekt] ... af!
project.' (for [~t ph~a.d3ekt]; feature of affrication reversed;
AL-156(29) 3;8)
b. Segments: AI: '[wak.x.be' baj.bi].' (for trock-a-bye-baby'
[wak.x.ba' btSi.bi]; vowels raj] and [ei] reversed; AL-l(26) 2;0)
c. Consonant clusters: AI: 'Sklppy hop, sklppy hop, [hf.pi skap].'
(for [ski.pi hap]: [sk] and rh] reversed; AL-36(28) 2;6)
d. Rhymes: AI: 'I was [d3'kk] tickling him.'
(for 'just tickling' [d3Ast thfk.t.IIJ]'; rhyme [rk] anticipated!
substituted for rhyme [Ast]; AL-116(6) 3;3)
e. Syllables: B: 'Why did you invite [detbra] . .. David an'
Barbara over?' (for [de'vid een bar.bra]: syllable [bro]
anticipated/substituted for syllable [Yid]; B-491(11) 5;4)
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGEDEVELOPMENT 23
f. Unclassifiable groups of segments: 00: 'Not [r1:s] cone! .. . Not
lee-cream cone!'
(for [a's.krim]; see below for discussion; OC-21(34) 2;3)
g. Lexical stress: An: 'I really wanna decorate Strawberry's house.'
(for 'decorate'; source 'decoration'; AN-260(32) 4;11)
h. Intonation:
---.
An: 'But.
~'
still .
I~
-. - - - -
--,'

.If"
-----_..---/
house of brick[s:]' ~ ,
.-:~ -- .-// \
(blend of 'he could not blow down that house of bricks' and
~
'he could not blow that house of bricks down.' (AN-258(33) 4JO)
In (lOa), the feature of affrication has been reversed, causing the segments [t]-[d3]
to be realized as [tf]-[d]. Segmental errors involve both consonants, as shown in
(1) above, and vowels, as in (4) and in (lOb) where the vowels [ej]-[ai] were
reversed. In (lOc), the onset consonant cluster [sk] from 'skippy' has been
reversed with the onset single consonant rh]. Example (lOd) shows an
anticipation of the rhyme [rk] from 'tickling', which was substituted for the
rhyme [xst] in 'just'. In (We), the whole syllable [bra] from 'Barbara' was
anticipated and substituted for the syllable [vod] in 'David'. In (l0f), the vowel
[ai], and the consonants [k] and [m] have been deleted, and the [s] moved to the
end of the word forming a new syllable [ris], but with the duration and pitch
contour of the intended utterance; this kind of error is termed a 'telescoping', as
will be explained in the next section. The error in ClOg) shows a case where the
lexical stress was shifted from the initial to the final syllable in 'decorate'.
Finally, in (lOh), the intonational pattern of the utterance reflects a blend of the
word order from one of the two target phrases with the intonation from the other
target.
Lexicalerrors involve paradigmatic substitutions and blends of meaningful
lexical items . Units involved include 1) entire words, both content and function,
both monomorphemic and polymorphemic; 2) content stems; and 3) inflectional
and derivational affixes. Examples of substitutions involving these types of
lexical items are given in (11) in abbreviated form. In Chapters 3 and 4 below I
will justify treating most polymorphemic words as whole lexical items, rather
than considering the error to involve specific morphemes within the words, as
well as give more precise definitions of 'content' and 'function' morphemes.
(11) Lexical units involved in errors.
a . Monomorphemic free content words: B: 'M6mmy, more c6ffee ...
more juice!' (B-20(35) 1;10)
24 KIDS' SLIPS
b. Polymorphemic free content words: OB: 'Take my Superman shirt
off.' (for 'Batman'; OC-75(35) 3;11)
c. Monomorphemic free function words:
AI: 'Here it IS, Momrny. I got it tOr my ... off my bed.'
(AL-55(36) 2;10)
d. Polymorphemic free function words:
OB: 'Ya know, M6m knows how to do it all by my . .. herself.'
(child started to substitute 'myself for 'herself; OC-84(36) 4;0)
e. Derivational affixes: B: 'My popsicle's in the freezy ... freezer.'
(B-447(37) 5;1)
f. Inflectional affixes: B: (sucking on a piece of candy)
'I've been sucked on ... I've been suckjng on this for a long time.'
(B-456(37) 5;1)
In example (l Ia), the child intends to ask for more juice, but because he sees
Mommy's coffee in the environment he erroneously substitutes the word
'coffee'. In (Llb) the child substitutes the compound 'Superman' for 'Batman'.
The error in (He) illustrates the substitution of an incorrect preposition, and
(lId) an incorrect bimorphemic pronoun. In (l1e) the child substitutes the
derivational suffix {-y} (adjectival) for {-er} (instrumental), and in (11f) the
inflectional suffix {-ed} (passive) is substituted for {-ing} (progressive) (I am
using curly brackets to indicate the"
lemma of an affix).
Syntactic errors involve the syntagmatic organization of phrasal strings,
and are of two basic types: the misplacement of lexical items (words and
morphemes) in the syntagmatic string, and phrase blends. While the former also
involve lexical units, they are classified as syntactic errors rather than lexical
errors since the error is not in lexical choice but in the erroneous placement of
lexical items in the linear order.
(12) Syntactic errors (see below for explanations).
a. Misplacement of content morpheme:
OG:'I'm p~tting your hair.'
M: 'You are?'
00: 'Yeah, so l: won't pet it ... pull it.' (OC-55(43) 3;7)
b. Reversal of two free function words:
B: 'Mommy, can you go with me?'
M: 'What?'
B: 'Can! go with you?' (B-96(46) 2;7)
c. Misplacement of inflectional suffix:
B: 'I never like boatS nde_ ... boat rides.' (*'boats ride' [bo'tts)
raid] for 'boat rides' [bo't raid(z)]; B-397(42) 4;10)
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 25
d. Phrase blend
M: 'Come 6n; I'm trying to clean this place up!'
AI: 'k won't I~t you tb.'
M: 'What?'
AI: .) don't ... ) won't let you.' (blend of .) won't let you' and 'I
don't want you to.' AL-71(49) 2;10)
In (l2a), the verb stem 'pet' has been perseverated and substituted for 'pull',
leaving the inflectional suffix {-ing} behind. In (l2b) the pronouns 'I' and 'you'
have been reversed, although in the error each is assigned correct case. The error
in (12c) is a morpheme movement: the plural {-s} has been anticipated and added
to the word 'boat' instead of the intended 'ride'. Note that the morpheme is
pronounced with the phonologically correct allomorph in its error position.
Example (12d) is a phrase blend, where the two phrasal targets have been blended
into an ungrammatical utterance (this definition will be refined below) .
Propositional errors occur when the speaker has formulated and produced
an utterance which encodes a proposition which is different from what he or she
had intended to say. For example:
(13) B: 'Mom, can I play on your computer?'
M: 'Well, "Fresh Prince" is gonna be on in a few minutes.'
B: ยทt wanna watch lt ... I mean I wanna play on your computer.'
(B-413(50) 4;11)
Here Bobby intended to reiterate to Mom that he wanted to play on the
computer, but because Mom mentioned the TV show "Fresh Prince", Bobby was
thinking about watching TV and erroneously conveyed the meaning that he
wanted to watch the show rather than play on the computer; he then immediately
corrected his utterance to the intended content. I have very few errors of this type
in both the child and adult data, partly because they are the most difficult to
accurately collect, since the researcher doesn't always know what meaning the
speaker actually intended to convey.
1.4.2 Directionality of Errors
The locational relationship between the target/error and source of the error is
the second dimension by which errors were categorized. There are two broad
parameters along which errors can be classified with regards to directionality:
contextuality and the paradigmaticlsyntagmatic relationship. There are also
several specific categories used for labelling directionality, which will be given
below.
First, errors can be divided into the broad categories 'contextual' vs. 'non-
contextual'. In 'contextual' errors, the source of the error involves some
linguistic unit which is actually being planned for the current discourse or has
been spoken in the discourse. In 'non-contextual' errors, there is no linguistic
26 KIDSI SLIPS
source in the utterance context. The second broad classification is 'paradigmatic'
and 'syntagmatic'. In paradigmatic errors, the target and error units are elements
which are related to each other in some linguistic paradigm (e.g. both are words ,
both are morphemes, both are phonemes) and are competing for the same slot in
a syntagmatic string. In syntagmatic errors, the target and the source of the error
are being planned for different slots in the syntagrnatic (linear) string, and one
influences the other by, for example, anticipation or perseveration. These two
parameters, 'contextuality' and 'paradigmatic vs. syntagmatic' are to some extent
orthogonal, and one or the other may be more pertinent to a particular type of
error.
Phonological errors are most often contextual and syntagmatic; that is, a
phonological unit planned for some location in an utterance affects a like unit
planned for some other location in the utterance, as in (lOa-e) above.
Phonological errors can be non-contextual, that is, a unit can be substituted,
added, or deleted with no obvious source in the utterance; however, this type of
error is very rare. An example of a non-contextual paradigmatic phonological
substitution is given in (14) below; in this case the vowel [i] in 'Mickey'
[rnf .ki] was erroneously produced as [g'-], but there was no [g'-] vowel or [r]
consonant which could have served as the source, produced in any other word in
the utterance.
(14) B: 'I like Deefree on the [mt.ke-] ... Mickey Mouse Club.'
(for 'Mickey' [mi.ki]; no [g'-] or [r] in context; B-241(30) 4;3)
Phonological errors can also include non-contextual additions or omissions,
in cases where there is no obvious source in the utterance. In (15a), an [I] is
added to the word 'food' with no obvious source; in (l5b) the [r] is left out of the
cluster [d31'] for no apparent reason; the unfilled underline marks the location of
the omission.
(15) a. An: 'Whenever I get hungry I get some [fJlid].'
(for 'food' [fud]; AN-I09(30) 3;3)
b. OB:'It's sort of funny that I don't get anything to [d3_II)k] .. .
to drink.'
(for 'drink' [d3flI)k]; note that the Idl remains [d3] even when
the [r] is omitted; see ยง3.3.5 for discussion; OC-69(30) 3;10)
Another phonological error which could be considered 'non-contextual' is the
type I have called 'telescoping', where some set of segments, including at least
one weight-bearing unit (vowel, rhyme, syllable) is omitted, but the utterance is
produced with the same overall duration and intonation contour as the intended
utterance, as illustrated in (l0f) above and (29) below. The classification of
telescoping errors in terms of the parameters 'paradigmatic' or 'syntagmatic' is
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCE FOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 27
somewhat ambiguous, although the latter is possibly more accurate because they
do change the structure of the syntagmatic string. In fact, this dimension could
simply be irrelevant to this type of non-contextual phonological error.
Turning to lexical errors, one can see that the errors labelled 'lexical
substitution errors' in this study, such as those presented in (11) above, are
paradigmatic and non-contextual by definition. In every case they involve two
paradigmatically related lexical items competing for the same syntagmatic slot,
and do not involve a word planned for some other location in the utterance. A
second type of lexical paradigmatic error is the 'blend', when two different lexical
items are planned for the same syntagmatic slot in a phrase, and their
phonological forms are blended into a single word. Examples of lexical blends
are given in (16), where (a) shows a content word blend, and (b) a function word
blend (see also (2b) above).
(16) a. B: 'That's a great big [fa.pa] bear!'
(blend of 'Father' [fa.<j3] and 'Poppa' [p'a.pa]: B-116(38) 2;10)
b. B: (telling what time it says on his and Alice's clocks)
'MIne is eight forty five, and [1.r-:] ... hers is eight forty five.'
(blend of 'she' Ui] and 'hers' [ho-z]: B-363(39) 4;9)
In some lexical blends, one or both of the targets has occurred in the preceding
utterance; however, both words were appropriate in the target syntagmatic slot,
and even if the child corrects to one of the two targets, there is no way of
knowing which word he or she actually intended to utter. Therefore these errors
have been counted as paradigmatic blends rather than perseverations, although
those where one or both of the targets were spoken elsewhere in the utterance are
considered to be 'contextual'. For example, in (17), either word 'milk' or
'juice' would have been an appropriate utterance for the child, so this is a
contextual paradigmatic blend. This example further illustrates the fact that
occasionally in very early word blends there are actual blends of segments, with
features from two distinct segmental targets blending into a third segment.
(17) M: 'Do you want m}/k or jliice?'
OB:'[lJuc].' (blend of 'milk' [mewk] and 'juice' [lue], with the onset
consonants [m] and [t] blending to produce (1)]; OC-4(38) 1;11)
However, if one lexical item is substituted for another and both were
planned for the utterance or spoken in the utterance context, this is a syntagmatic
and contextual error, and is considered a 'syntactic' error in this study. Examples
are given in (12a,b) above. Other researchers have reported non-contextual lexical
additions or omissions (e.g. Stemberger 1989), but in my data, errors which
might be classified as such are usually more simply classifiable as phrase blends.
On the other hand, phrase blend errors, as in (12d), are paradigmatic errors, since
they involve two competing phrases (Le. in a paradigmatic relationship to each
28 KIDS' SLIPS
other) which have been blended together and inserted into the same phrasal slot.
Their 'contextuality' is difficult to ascertain because they are both
simultaneously being planned for the utterance, and part of each phrase is uttered;
thus this will be considered an irrelevant parameter for this type of error.
Finally, propositional errors are always paradigmatic since they involve two
competing propositions; again the 'contextuality' parameter is irrelevant,
although this type of error may involve some environmental or discourse (but
not utterance) influence as in (13) above.
Naturally when a non-contextual error is made, the child may have been
thinking about another word or phrasing of the proposition which was in fact the
source of the error. However when such sources are not verbalized by the child,
and when they are not obvious from the immediate physical or discourse context,
the observer cannot report on them; for this reason such errors are classified as
'non-contextual'. One complication of the current study is the fact that the adult
subjects often did verbalize the source of the error by making comments such as
'Oh, I was thinking about X' or 'I almost said X'. However, in order to keep
the adult data as comparable as possible to the child data, I did not utilize these
comments in my classification of the adult data for the most part, since it was
usually unavailable in the child data.
The more specific divisions in terms of directionality are relevant to
contextual syntagmatic errors only. In syntagmatic errors, both the target and
source units are being planned for the utterance (or discourse), and one or both of
these become misplaced or repeated. Both phonological and lexical units can be
involved in syntagmatic errors. There are three basic types of directionality:
1) Anticipation: the source follows the target. Some linguistic unit planned
for later in the utterance is anticipated and affects a unit planned for earlier in the
utterance.
2) Perseveration: the target follows the source. Some linguistic unit planned
for and executed earlier in the utterance perseverates and affects a unit planned for
later in the utterance.
3) Exchange: two elements exchange positions. This can include both
metathesis, where contiguous units exchange, and reversals, where non-
contiguous units exchange.
Anticipations can be 'complete' or 'incomplete'. In a complete
anticipation, both the error and source are spoken before the speaker corrects the
utterance, as illustrated in (18).
(18) a. An: 'I got [d3re1>]- jUice.' ([d3] anticipated from 'juice' [d3US],
substituted for [g] in grape' [gre'p]; AN-42(1) 2;4)
b. B: 'Mommy, when it chews, it . . . when! chew, it hurts.'
('it' anticipated from second clause, substituted for'!' in first
clause, with change in verb agreement; 8-436(41) 5;0)
In an incomplete anticipation, the error is noticed and corrected before the speaker
KIDS' SLIPS AS EVIDENCEFORLANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT 29
utters the source, as illustrated in (19).
(19) a. AI: 'Now we have [IAn] ... Qne left.' ([1] from 'left' [left]
anticipated, substituted for [w] of 'one' [wxn]; AL-153(7) 3;7)
b. AI: (putting her feet on the kitchen table) 'My p)gยง. ... my toes are
pigs' feet.' ('pig' anticipated, substituted for 'toe', stranding
plural and possessive suffixes; AL-97(4l) 3;2)
Some researchers (Shattuck-Hufnagel 1979) have argued that incomplete
anticipations should be considered a separate class from complete anticipations,
since in fact it is possible that they represent interrupted exchanges; that is, the
speaker may have planned an erroneous exchange of units, but his or her external
monitor noticed and corrected the error before the second element was uttered. So
for example, in the above utterances, Alice could have been planning to say
'Now we have [lAn weft]' and 'My plgs are tdes' feet.' However, there are a
number of reasons to consider these errors anticipations. First, unambiguous
(complete) anticipations are far more common than complete exchanges,
suggesting that erroneous anticipations are planned more often than exchanges in
general (see Chapter 2 for details). Second, there are many cases of incomplete
anticipations where the exchange would cause an illegal utterance, as illustrated
in (20).
(20) AI: 'I get [gIAm.pi] ... grumpy when I sleep.' ([1] from 'sleep'
anticipated and substituted for Irl [~] in 'grumpy'; AL-l04(7) 3;3)
In this case if the III and Irl had been exchanged, the illegal cluster Isr! would
have been produced in *'sreep'. Since planning errors rarely produce illegal
phonotactic sequences in a language, this argues against the claim that such
sequences are planned during speech production planning (although one could
make the argument that the fact that they are illegal causes the internal monitor
to spot them before they are produced).
Third, there are a number of incomplete anticipations which involve
additions or omissions, which cannot by definition be an exchange. (An actual
movement of a unit from a position planned for later in the utterance into an
earlier position is classified below as a 'movement' rather than an exchange;
such movements also occur as perseverations, and are in general quite rare.)
Fourth, in anticipations, the target and source can be several syllables away from
each other, but in exchanges they are usually only one or two syllables distant;
in many of the incompletes, the source is fairly distant from the target. Finally,
as I will argue in Chapter 3, both complete and incomplete anticipations tend to
show the same prosodic pattern, in which the source word carries the tonic
stress. Exchanges, on the other hand, show a prosodic pattern in which the tonic
syllable occurs on either the first or second element of the exchange with equal
frequency. For all of these reasons I will count incomplete anticipations as a
196 KIDS' SLIPS
telescopings made by the I-year-olds in this study maintained aspects of the
pitches of the lexical items involved in the utterance, even when some vowels
were deleted, it seems most likely that this prosodic pattern is linked to the word
node itself rather than to vowels, for example, and thus has some autosegmental
features in even the earliest representations.
However, after age 2, some of the other phonetic properties involved in
adult English lexical stress begin to appear in the children's productions. As
indicated in ยง3.3.4 above, when the children were around 2;3-2;5 the durational
properties of their words began to sound more adult-like, and furthermore they
began to show some evidence of allophonic variations which were linked to
stress (for example, unstressed vowels became more schwa-like, medial voiceless
plosives were aspirated only in onsets of stressed syllables). Thus by the age of
2;6, which I have argued above is the time that internal syllable structure begins
to be developed, the children show evidence of having some sort of indication in
their form lexicon of which syllables are stressed and which are unstressed.
Since it is at this age that the syllable-node tier begins to develop, perhaps this
information about stress is represented as a sort of feature such as [+stress] or
[-stress], linked to the syllable nodes. This feature could be the basis for the
eventual development of the 'strong/weak' rhythmic tier, allowing foot structure
to appear, which I have argued begins to develop around age 4. While this
scenario for the development of the representation of lexical stress is speculative,
it is completely compatible with the SOT data, as well as the hypothesis
presented above about the development of the representation of syllable structure.
3.7.2 Phrasal Rhythm
It is often noted that one of the most important functions of lexical stress,
besides distinguishing one word from another, is to contribute to the overall
rhythmic structure of sentences. English is often called a 'stress-timed' language
since stressed syllables are said to come at relatively regular intervals in an
utterance. The question I will raise here is whether or not this has any relevance
to actual speech production planning, especially where the 'Phonological
Processes' component is involved.
In SOT research it is a truism that two units are more likely to be mutually
involved in an error if they occur in locations in the syntagmatic string with the
same stress value, particularly if they are both stressed (Boomer & Laver 1973,
Garrett 1975). Cutler (l980a) explains that this is because two stressed units
have higher activation than unstressed units, and thus are more likely to interact
with one another than two unstressed units or a stressed with an unstressed unit.
In this section I will address this issue in terms of phonological errors; in
Chapter 4 (ยง4.2.5) I will look at lexical errors in this light.
In order to see whether the children followed this same well-documented
pattern, I looked at all the between-word contextual phonological anticipations,
perseverations, AlPs, and exchanges (but not 'multiple' errors) in which the
target and source were uniquely identifiable, or if there was more than one
source, where all sources would give the same analysis. I did not include
PHONETICS ANDPHONOLOGY 197
within-word errors, since they often involve two syllables with different stress
levels and so are apparently governed by a different process. 1 also did not
include metathesis errors, since they usually occur in adjacent syllables, which
almost by definition contain different stress levels. Cases in which the error
involved more than one syllable, such as the rhyme of one syllable and the onset
of the following syllable where the two syllables had different stress values (i.e.
R$O errors), were also not included in the count. Finally, I did not include the
adult errors in categories 6.5, 10.5, and 11.5, since the children did not make
comparable errors (I will return to this point below).
To every syllable involved in the error, 1 assigned either a 'strong' or a
'weak' value, depending on its value in the rhythm of the phrase. This was a
simple task since 'strong' beats were always marked in my notes when the error
was originally collected. This was a somewhat different measure from that used
in assigning lexical stress for looking at lexical substitution errors. First, it was
binary rather than having three levels of stress, since only the syllable's status as
stressed or not stressed is relevant here. Second, for this phrase-stress analysis I
did mark syllables in words with 3+ syllables which carried tertiary stress as
'strong' when they were pronounced as relatively strong beats in the phrase; so
for example, 'recommend' was considered to have a S-W-S pattern. Finally, I
included syllabic inflectional affixes in the rhythmic structure of the phrase,
whereas they were not considered in assigning lexical stress patterns to words in
lexical substitution errors, since stems without inflectional affixes were taken as
the unit of lexical representation. I then counted the number of errors in which
target and source syllables (or both targets in the case of exchanges) were either
both 'strong' or both 'weak', or involved one 'strong' and one 'weak' syllable.
The results are shown in Table 3.23. In this table I have divided the 1-2-year-
oIds' errors into '1-2a', in this case those children in the 2-word stage when the
error was made, and '1-2b', Le. errors made by 1- or 2-year-old children in the
3+word stage.
It is clear from Table 3.23 that errors in which both the target and source
syllables were stressed predominated in both the child and adult data; overall this
pattern accounted for 78% of the child errors and 79.5% of the adult errors in this
count, and at every age they were overwhelmingly the most common type
(between 71.5-81.5%). The youngest children, Le. 1- and 2-year aids in the 2-
word stage, had the lowest percentage of errors involving units in two stressed
syllables, 71.5%. This figure increased 9% for the 1':'2-year-olds in the 3+word
stage, so it is likely that the increase in importance of syntagmatic phrasal
planning which occurs when children begin to plan utterances of three or more
words accounts for the increase in importance of phrasal stress in phonological
planning. Interestingly, the figure dropped somewhat for the 5-year-olds, which
may be due to the fact that at this age they were learning more multi-syllabic
words, and so had many more unstressed syllables available for error per phrase
than the younger children. This would fit with the fact that overall the children's
second most common error type involved one strong and one weak syllable, but
for the adults the second most common type involved two unstressed syllables,
and adults also know many multisyllabic words. In fact, if I were to add in the
198 KIDS'SLIPS
TABLE 3.23
Number and percentage of unambiguous between-word phonological
errors where target and source units fell into three stress categories:
[+str] = both target and source units occurred in stressed syllables;
[-str] = both target and source units occurred in unstressed syllables;
[+1- str] = one of target/source units occurred in a stressed syllable and the
other in an unstressed syllable.
Age: 1-2a 1-2b 3 4 5 Total Adult
[+ str] % 71.5% 80.5% 77% 81.5% 73% 78% 79.5%
[-str] % 14.25% 8.5% 10% 5.5% 10% 8.5% 13%
[+I-str] % 14.25% 11% 13% 13% 17% 13.5% 7.5%
Total N= 14 107 99 146 103 469 189
errors from the three 'adults-only' categories, 6.5, 10.5, and 11.5, the adult
figure for interaction between two unstressed syllables would be 17%, since
these categories involve adding extra syllables to the target word, and in every
case these syllables were unstressed. It is likely that the difference between
stressed and unstressed syllables is greater both in planning and execution of
speech for adults, since, as discussed in the preceding section, the phonetic cues
for stress are not as robust in the children's speech as they are for adults;
therefore it is not surprising that the children could violate this distinction more
readily than the adults.
In ยง3.2.3 above I showed that the most important phonetic factor involved
in explaining vowel errors was the stress level of the vowel; this factor was
more important than segmental features such as height, backness, or roundness.
From Table 3.23 it can be seen that the influence of phrasal stress is not just a
factor in vowel errors but in all phonological errors. However, if the vowel
errors are separated out from the consonant errors we find that the phrasal stress
is a somewhat more important factor for vowels than for consonants. In Table
3.9, the overall figure for two stressed vowels was 79.5% for the children and
81% for adults, slightly higher than the overall averages from Table 3.23; but
Table 3.9 includes both between-word and within-word errors. If we take just the
between-word errors from Table 3.23, the children's figures are: two stressed
syllables: 82% vowels, 77.5% consonants and LUs; two unstressed syllables:
8% vowels, 8% consonants and LUs; stressed and unstressed syllable: 10%
vowels, 14% consonants and LUs, with a 90% overall 'same syllable weight' for
vowels vs. 85.5% for consonants and LUs. The adults similarly show an overall
97% 'same syllable weight' for vowels vs. 92% for consonants and LUs. Thus
for consonants and LUs, although the same stress level is important, other
factors such as phonetic similarity and syllable structure position can outweigh
the importance of syllable weight. (See Berg 1990 for a similar finding in
PHONETICS ANDPHONOLOOY 199
German.)
There may appear at first to be a contradiction in this argument, since in my
illustration of the development of syllable structure in (93) above I suggested
that the actual 'strong-weak' designations which are licensed by foot structure
are not represented in syllable structure until age 4. However, the most likely
developmental progression is that at ages 2-3, when there is evidence of the
influence of the weight of syllables within the phrasal stress pattern but no clear
evidence for foot structure, the 'weight' factor is given by the lexical stress,
which is represented in the lexicon when the word is first learned, as discussed in
the preceding section. The consistency of the weight of syllables in
phonological errors would also be facilitated by the fact that function words are
typically unstressed, a factor to which children are sensitive from their earliest
multi-word utterances (Gerken 1994); this is one reason why function words are
less susceptible to error than content words in general. As suggested above,
lexical stress is probably the phonetic factor which allows the development of
foot structure within individual lexical representations; then lexical stress along
with the distinction between stressed content words and unstressed function
words allows the development of phrasal rhythmic structures. I would thus
predict that it would be at about age 4 that children would start showing signs of
stress shifting within individual words when such shift is required by the overall
rhythmic structure of the phrase, as in 'discovered Mississippi' vs. 'Mississippi
RIver', where primary stress shifts to a different inherently strong syllable
within the word due to phrasal rhythm (Prince 1983, Kenstowicz 1994:554-5).
Testing of this prediction awaits future research.
3.7.3 Tonic Stress as an Organizer of the Syntagmatic Phonological String
In phonological phrases, there is one word which has special pragmatic
prominence, typically because it is either the new information in focus in the
phrase, or its meaning is being foregrounded in some pragmatically relevant way
(e.g. emphasis, contrast, denial of previous statement, etc.). I will call the word
which has this pragmatic prominence the 'tonic word' of the phrase. The
primary-stressed syllable of the tonic word receives 'tonic stress', that is, the
strongest stress in the phrase. Most typically, this syllable is marked
phonetically in declarative utterances by being the highest pitched syllable in the
phrase; the pitch then falls to the end of the phrase. In questions, it takes the
highest pitch in the phrase except for the rising-pitch which occurs on the final
word(s) of the question. Besides these pitch patterns, the tonic syllable (i.e. the
syllable which takes tonic stress) is marked by an exaggeration of the other
features which normally mark lexical stress: lengthening of segments, full value
of vowels in the syllable, specific allophones of consonants (e.g. aspirated
voiceless stops), and intensity.
Because of the special function of this prosodically marked syllable in a
phrase, it would not be surprising if it played some important role in speech
production planning, specifically in the planning of the phonetic properties of
the utterance. (In this chapter I will fccus on the role of the tonic syllable in
