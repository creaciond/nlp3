Kayardild to be sensitive to morphological structure in a manner which the empirical
facts demand, it sufﬁces for underlying forms to consist of ordered strings of morphs
(or in some instances allomorph sets) divided from each other by certain types of
phonological juncture. Further diacritic features are unnecessary.
The phonology itself (Round 2009) has been argued to contain a lexical compon-
ent in which phonological modiﬁcations apply solely within the domain of single
words, and a post-lexical component for larger constituents. The output of the lexical
component corresponds more or less to the phonemic level of structuralist linguistics
and Basic Linguistic Theory (Dixon 1997; Dryer 2006), the surface representation of
early generative phonology (Chomsky and Halle 1968), the lexical level of Lexical
Phonology (Kiparsky 1982a, 1982b; Mohanan 1982), and the representational level
which in practice corresponds to the phonological ‘outputs’ of much contemporary
research in Optimality Theory. It also corresponds to what is represented by the
orthographic form of Kayardild words. For discussion and argumentation see Round
(2009).
1.3.5 On the lack of morphemes
A signiﬁcant theoretical construct which is absent from the grammatical model just
outlined is the morpheme. In structuralist theory the morpheme is a Saussurean sign
indissolubly uniting a meaning (or function) with a phonological form, and is the
fundamental unit of morphological analysis (Bloomﬁeld 1933; Harris 1942; Nida
1946). Although the morpheme continues to hold this central role in Basic Linguistic
Theory (Dixon 1997; Dryer 2006), and although it is often still assumed in research
within generative phonology (e.g. Kenstowicz 1994; Kager 1999) it has been absent
from many of the theoretical approaches to formal morphology to have emerged over
the past two decades following compelling arguments for its abandonment due to
Matthews (1974) and elaborated by Anderson (1992), Aronoff (1994), Beard (1995),
and others.7
A signiﬁcant difference, therefore, between the analysis of Kayardild
presented here and the analysis by Evans (1995a) is that Evans’ analysis is morphemic
whereas the present analysis does not work in the same theoretic conﬁnes. Evans’
innovative and inﬂuential morphemic approach to some of the Kayardild data will be
reviewed in Chapter 2.
1.4 Extensions and implications
For reasons of space and cohesiveness the book concentrates speciﬁcally on the
analysis of inﬂection in Kayardild. In this volume I do not in general attempt
to draw out the implications for broader morphological theory of the analytic

1.4 Extensions and implications 9
machinery developed here, nor do I attempt to apply it to fragments of inﬂectional
systems of other languages. This is by no means to imply that such work is not
needed, only that it lies beyond the scope of the present work. See Round (2011a)
for extensions of the analysis to derivational morphology in Kayardild, Round (in
prep a., in prep. b.) for a more techinical and theoretically comparative discussion
of Kayardild’s morphomic structures, and Round (in prep c.) for its implications
for the theory of morphomes and morphological complexity more generally. In
terms of extensions to other languages, some obvious candidates are the other
Tangkic languages, especially Lardil (Hale 1973; Klokeid 1976; Round 2011b, 2011c)
and Yukulta (Keen 1972, 1983; Round 2011c), whose morphologies possess many
superﬁcial similarities and no doubt several deeper similarities to Kayardild; also
the several Australian languages discussed by Blake (1993) which like Kayardild
employ etymologically related sufﬁxes for multiple and diverse inﬂectional functions.
The analysis here may also have implications for interpretations of Dench and Evans’
(1988) seminal paper on case stacking and the various functions of multiple case
markers in Australian languages. Round (in prep c.) offers some comparisons
between the morphomes of Kayardild and those of the more intensively studied
romance languages (Maiden 2005).
1.5 Notational conventions
Some notational conventions may be mentioned now. All phonological representa-
tions are expressed in IPA characters. Morphomic categories appear in the format μx
(e.g. μobl), while morphosyntactic feature values are written in the format feature:
value (e.g. case:locative), and features as a whole are referred to in small capitals, for
example case. Interlinear glosses may contain up to six lines, though typically will
contain fewer. A maximal example is shown in (1.3).

1.6 Outline
The book is divided into ten further chapters plus two appendices. Chapter 2
provides a general introduction to Kayardild word structure, outlining the kinds of
morphs of which words are composed, their formal shapes, and principles of
combination, and presents reasons for the choice of grammatical model in which
morphomic representations mediate between morphosyntactic representations and
underlying phonological forms. Chapter 3 treats several speciﬁc details of Kayardild
morphology which are not central to the main theme of the book, but which appear
within the data which will support its main arguments. Chapter 4 sets the scene for
the next several chapters, supplying an overview of the ways in which Kayardild
syntax interfaces with the inﬂectional morphology. This is then explored in detail
in Chapter 5 on clause structure, Chapter 6 on DPs, Chapter 7 on DP juxtaposition,
and Chapter 8 on the formal model of feature percolation. Chapter 9 considers
matters that arise from the chapters on syntax and it is there that the present
analysis is compared most closely with the analysis of Evans (1995a). Chapter 10
introduces the class of non-inﬂecting particles. Chapter 11 presents a complete
formal implementation of the mappings in Kayardild from the morphosyntactic
representation through to underlying forms within a constraint-based framework.
Appendix A tables comparisions between the units of the current analysis and of
Evans (1995a). Appendix B presents a large body of empirical evidence in support
of the syntactic argumentation in Chapter 5.

Morphological structures
This chapter introduces the morphological constituents of syntactic words in Kayar-
dild and the arguments supporting them. A Kayardild word consists of a lexical stem
which is potentially followed by inﬂectional sufﬁxes, and ends obligatorily with a
termination element.1
Lexical stems consist of roots, sufﬁxes, and thematic elem-
ents. Each lexical stem falls into one of two morphological classes, refered to as
nominal and verbal, following Evans (1995a) and standard Australianist practice.
Roots too are classiﬁed as nominal or verbal. A nominal lexical stem is minimally
comprised of a single nominal root, while a verbal lexical stem is minimally com-
prised of a verbal root plus a lexically associated thematic. In the following discussion
I will use the term morph to refer to any underlying phonological string which has a
morphological identity. The chapter is organized as follows. The phonology of
Kayardild is summarized in }2.1. Arguments are provided in }2.2 for the structure
of Kayardild’s simplest nominal and verbal stems, consisting of roots and thematics.
Sufﬁxes are discussed in }2.3, and the termination element speciﬁcally in }2.4.
Section 2.5 examines the suppletive allomorphy of three sufﬁxes and }2.6 discusses
morphomes.
2.1 Kayardild phonology
The phonemic inventory of Kayardild is given in Tables 2.1–2.2. The representation
of phonemes in the Kayardild practical orthography is shown in italics.2
Words in Kayardild all begin with a consonant and end with a vowel except for the
ﬁnal word in an utterence, from which any ﬁnal short vowel of the word’s lexical
1
Preﬁxes do not occur. However, see }3.2.6 for verbal compounds whose initial element can resemble a
preﬁx. A small class of phonological clitics also exists (Round 2009). Their role is marginal and will not be
discussed here.

The homorganic clusters /ɳʈ, n̪t̪, ɲc/ are respresented orthographically as rnd, nth, and nj respectively
(rather than rnrd, nhth, and nyj). The orthography also distinguishes homorganic /ŋk/ ngk, from heteror-
ganic /nk/ nk, while the cluster /ɻʈ/ is written rld to distinguish it from the single plosive /ʈ/, written rd.
representation will be deleted. Restrictions on the shapes of individual morphs are
discussed individually in subsequent sections.
The phonological phenomenon of greatest interest when our central concern is
morphology is phonological juncture. It will be assumed, following arguments in
Round (2009), that phonological modiﬁcations to underlying forms in Kayardild can
be grouped into two major classes. The application of modiﬁcations from one class or
the other is determined by the kind of phonological juncture which appears at the
boundary between two morphs. This entails that there are two avenues through
which morphological information can feed into phonological forms: in its determin-
ation of which morphs appear, and in its determination of which junctures appear
between those morphs.
The key differences in the effects of the two junctures are summarized in Table 2.3.
The leftmost column and topmost row of Table 2.3 display segments in underlying
phonological strings which lie respectively to the left and right of a juncture. Filled
cells display the surface outcomes of phonological modiﬁcations in those cases where
the outcomes differ depending on the juncture. The signiﬁcant point is that surface
outcomes often differ when the same string of segments spans a regular versus an
exceptional juncture. Thus, because juncture matters to the phonology, it also
matters to the morphology. The output from the morphology must contain not
only the correct segmental morphs but the correct junctures too.
Much more could be said about the segmental and prosodic phonology of Kayar-
dild but this need not concern us in any detail here. Stated brieﬂy, there are many
modiﬁcations to underlying consonant clusters in addition to those shown in

Table 2.3, as well as modiﬁcations to vowels in hiatus and the deletion of underlying
word-ﬁnal consonants. All of these modiﬁcations involve assimilation, coalescence,
or deletion, but never epenthesis. The stress system of Kayardild is sensitive to
morphological structure, but since stress itself conditions neither segmental modiﬁ-
cations nor the distribution of junctures, it can be safely abstracted away from. For an
extensive coverage of the phonology of Kayardild see Round (2009).
2.2 Roots and thematics
This section examines roots and thematics as they appear in Kayardild lexical stems.
2.2.1 The simplest nominal stems: nominal roots
The simplest nominal stems consist of a single root. Representative examples are
shown in (2.1) where the ﬁrst line is orthographic and the second phonological.

14 Morphological structures
All nominal roots begin with a single consonant, are minimally CV in length, and
may end in a short vowel or any of the single consonants or consonant clusters listed
in Table 2.4.
2.2.2 The simplest verbal stems: verbal root + thematic
In this section I argue that the simplest verbal stems are bipartite, consisting of a root
plus a lexically speciﬁed thematic element. Since the interpretation of Kayardild
inﬂection in later chapters will make signiﬁcant use of this analysis, care is taken to
motivate it in some detail.
The surface phonological forms of two maximally simple verbal stems inﬂected
with a selction of sufﬁxes are shown in Table 2.5.
In the analysis adopted here, the stems in Table 2.5 are buruth- /puɻut̪/ ‘gather’ and
badij- /patic/ ‘carry’ while the sufﬁxes (on the surface) are /-a, -uː, -ara, -ia/. More
generally, all verbal stems in the Kayardild lexicon end in either a laminal dental
plosive /t̪/ or a laminal palatal /c/. I will refer to this as the laminal-ﬁnal analysis of
verbal stems. Under a laminal-ﬁnal analysis the sufﬁxes which attach to verbal stems
are always blind to whether the stem ends in /t̪/ versus /c/: there is no need to posit
allomorphy which is sensitive to the distinction between /t̪/-ﬁnal and /c/-ﬁnal stems.
An alternative analysis of verbal stems is pursued in Evans (1995a), which I will
refer to as the vowel-ﬁnal analysis. Under the vowel-ﬁnal analysis the consonants /t̪/
and /c/ in Table 2.5 are understood as belonging to the sufﬁx, while the stems /puɻu/
‘gather’ and /pati/ ‘carry’ are vowel-ﬁnal. There are several consequences of analysing
verbal stems as vowel-ﬁnal in this way. First, the sufﬁxes in Table 2.5 will all exhibit
allomorphy, as /{-t̪a, -ca} {-t̪uː, -cuː}, {-t̪ara, -cara}, {-t̪ia, -cia}/. Secondly, verbal
stems will need to be assigned to one of two declensions, one selecting for dental
initial sufﬁxes and the other for palatal initial. As it happens, in many cases the
declensional membership of a verbal stem can be predicted on phonological grounds
from its ﬁnal vowel. Stems ending in /i/ always belong to the palatal declension, as do
polysyllabic stems ending in a long vowel, while simple roots (though not all complex

stems) ending in /u/ predictably belong to the dental declension. Nonetheless there
remains a substantial portion of cases in which declensional membership cannot be
predicted and must be lexically listed. Prominent among these are verbal stems
ending in /a/, such as those in Table 2.6.
The vowel-ﬁnal analysis incurs the cost of positing abstract stem declensions and
sufﬁxal allomorphy. To appreciate its principal beneﬁt we must consider inﬂected
forms of the type in Table 2.7.
The inﬂected forms in Table 2.7 are representative of a wider set of cases in which
the verbal sufﬁx begins either with a laminal nasal /n̪/ or /ɲ/, or with an apical-
alveolar /t/ or /n/. In every one of these cases the laminal plosives /t̪/ and /c/, seen in
Table 2.5 and 2.6, fail to appear in the surface forms of the inﬂected verbs. This fact is
straightforwardly accounted for if we assume that verbal stems are vowel ﬁnal and
that the plosives /t̪/ and /c/ in Table 2.5 and 2.6 belong to sufﬁxes. In Table 2.7 the
vowel-ﬁnal verbal stems all appear as expected. The apprehensive sufﬁx has allo-
morphs /{-n̪ara, -ɲara}/, beginning with a dental and palatal nasal, which are selected
for according to declension as usual. The apical-initial sufﬁxes such as desiderative
/-ta/ and negative potential /-naŋkuː/ have just one form which attaches to stems of
both declensions.
Although the vowel-ﬁnal analysis has immediate appeal, the laminal-ﬁnal analysis
is preferable for several reasons. So far we have seen that both analyses account for
the ﬁrst sets of data in Tables 2.5 and 2.6, although at the cost of positing declensions
and sufﬁxal allomorphy in the case of the vowel-ﬁnal analysis, and that the data in
Table 2.7 receive a straightforward interpretation under the vowel-ﬁnal analysis. The
ﬁrst defence of the laminal-ﬁnal analysis is that it too accounts for the data in
Table 2.7 without difﬁculty.

16 Morphological structures
In the phonological system of Kayardild any underlying cluster comprised of a
laminal plosive followed by an apical will result on the surface without exception in a
single, apical alveolar segment. Some examples are shown in Table 2.8.
As a consequence of this, the inﬂected forms in Table 2.7 whose sufﬁxes begin on
the surface with apical alveolar /t/ and /n/ are accountable for in terms of the
presence of underlying of clusters /c-ʈ/, /t̪-ʈ/, /c-ɳ/, or /t̪-ɳ/. In those clusters
the ﬁrst segment is the ﬁnal laminal of a laminal-ﬁnal verbal stem, while the second
is the underlyingly initial segment of the sufﬁx. The other sufﬁxes of concern in
Table 2.7 begin on the surface with laminal nasals /n̪/ and /ɲ/, and it can be assumed
uncontroversially3
that these result from underlying clusters /c+ɲ/ and /t̪+ɲ/. Rep-
resentative derivations of the forms in Table 2.7 according to a laminal-ﬁnal analysis
of verbal stems are shown in Table 2.9.
At this point, both analyses account for both sets of data. The vowel-ﬁnal analysis
incurs a morphological cost of positing abstract declensions and sufﬁxal allomorphy.
The laminal-ﬁnal analysis entails the phonological cost (if one considers it a cost) of
positing underlying clusters such as /t̪-ɳ/ which are simpliﬁed on the surface
according to the regular patterns of the Kayardild sound system. Two additional
arguments refer to phonological data which, while unproblematic for the laminal-
ﬁnal analysis, demand additional and ad-hoc machinery if they are to be accounted
for under the vowel-ﬁnal analysis.

Although underlying clusters /c+ɲ/ and /t̪+ɲ/ are not independently attested in Kayardild, we can
note that all underlying clusters ending in a coronal nasal surface as either a cluster ending in a nasal or as a
single nasal segment, and that all underlying clusters beginning with a laminal plosive followed by a ‘+’
juncture surface as a cluster beginning with a laminal or as a single laminal segment. Putting these
generalizations together, one predicts /c+ɲ/! [ɲ] and /t̪+ɲ/! [n̪].
2.2 Roots and thematics 17
In a short while, I will present evidence that the ﬁnal laminal segments of verbal
stems have a degree of morphological autonomy. That autonomy is relevant in the
analysis of verbal stem reduplication. Verbal stem reduplication in Kayardild is
derivational. It may be semantically idiosyncratic or may serve semantically regular,
productive functions such as conveying pluractionality (Wood 2007), that is, the
multiple repetition of an action, either sequentially, or simultaneously by distributed
actors (Evans 1995:290). In most cases when a verbal stem is reduplicated, the full
stem including the ﬁnal laminal is repeated in the underlying representation, as
shown in Table 2.10, examples (a–k). Note that phonological modiﬁcations more
often than not will obscure the underlying form to some degree. Under certain
phonologically deﬁned conditions (namely, when the stem begins with a plosive)
the dental laminal does not reduplicate, even underlyingly, as in Table 2.10 (l–o).
The reduplicated forms in examples (l–o) are easily accounted for under the
vowel-ﬁnal analysis, since what reduplicates is the vowel-ﬁnal constituent. The data
in examples (a–k) require another explanation. If we focus on fully inﬂected words, it
might be proposed that the forms in examples (a–k) involve an underlying copying of
the ﬁrst segment of the sufﬁx, as shown in (2.2).
(2.2) a. acuri-c- acuri-cu ‘walk around (rdp)-pot’ (cf Table 2.10a)
b. arwa-t- arwa-tu ‘cook (rdp)-pot’ (cf Table 2.10j)
However, consider what happens when the sufﬁx lacks an overt laminal plosive.
According to the sufﬁx-copying hypothesis we would expect that the sufﬁx-initial,

non-laminal segment would be copied, but this is not the case. What appears at the
end of the ﬁrst copy of the stem is a laminal plosive as shown in (2.3), where the stem
is inﬂected with the continuous sufﬁx /-n/.
(2.3) ŋilti-c-ŋilti-n-, ŋilti-n-ŋilti-n- ‘cough (rdp)-cont’ (cf Table 2.10b)
Consequently, to account for reduplicated verbal forms the vowel-ﬁnal analysis of
verbal stems must be augmented with an ad-hoc process of ‘underlying laminal
insertion’ to account for the data in Table 2.10 (a–k). When that process applies,
the fact that the inserted segment is a laminal plosive remains accidental, and is
unrelated to the morphology of simple stems and their sufﬁxes. Under the laminal-
ﬁnal analysis of verbal stems, the data in Table 2.10 (a–k) follow naturally from the
reduplication of the full stem. The fact that it is a laminal plosive appearing at the end
of the ﬁrst copy is principled. The minority of the data in Table 2.10 (l–o) require
stipulation under either analysis. The vowel-ﬁnal analysis must stipulate that laminal
insertion fails to occur, while the laminal-ﬁnal analysis must stipulate that the ﬁnal
laminal of the verbal stem fails to copy.

2.2 Roots and thematics 19
There is one more phonological argument in favour of the laminal-ﬁnal analysis.
The inﬂected verbal words in Table 2.11 all contain the underlying sufﬁx /ɳaŋ/
expressing negative polarity.
On the surface the negative sufﬁx appears as [naŋ] or [na]. In (e,f) the underlying
consonant /ŋ/ undergoes regular word-ﬁnal deletion and in all forms the initial nasal
appears as the non-retroﬂex [n]. This is problematic for the vowel-ﬁnal analysis
of verbal stems due to the conﬂuence of two facts. First, there is good evidence that
the underlying form of the negative sufﬁx is /ɳaŋ/, with an initial retroﬂex nasal.
Secondly, under no other circumstances in Kayardild phonology does underlying
/V-ɳ/, with a retroﬂex nasal, yield surface [Vn] with non-retroﬂex [n]. The under-
lying form of the verbs in Table 2.11 therefore cannot consist of a vowel-ﬁnal stem
followed directly by the negative sufﬁx, at least under any regular reading of the
phonology. The details are as follows.
We saw above in Table 2.8 that underlying strings of a laminal plosive plus /ɳ/
yield surface [n], in which case the forms in Table 2.11 are predicted correctly by the
laminal-ﬁnal analysis. Of concern for the vowel-ﬁnal analysis is that underlying
sequences of /V-ɳ/ yield surface [Vɳ], as shown in Table 2.12.
This is problematic because evidence indicates that the negative sufﬁx does begin
underlyingly with /ɳ/. The Kayardild negative sufﬁx very seldom attaches to
anything other than verbal stems but it is occasionally encountered on nominals
(Evans 1995:374–5). Evans transcribes the sufﬁx as surface -nang- [naŋ] after vowel-
ﬁnal nominal stems but the examples for which I have recordings, shown in
Table 2.13 and including one which Evans transcribes with [n], all contain a
retroﬂex [ɳ].
This is corroborated by comparative evidence. In the Northern Tangkic language
Lardil, verbal stems almost all end underlyingly with the laminal plosive (Round
2011b; Klokeid 1976:85), and their negative inﬂections contain surface non-retroﬂex
[n] from underlying /c-ɳ/ as illustrated in (2.4).

However, there are two verbal stems in Lardil which descend historically from
nominals, ‘say’ /kaŋ/ and ‘cry’ /ɻik/. In Lardil phonology the velar segments /ŋ/
and /k/ typically delete when followed underlyingly by a nasal. As such, when /kaŋ/
and /ɻik/ are inﬂected with /ɳeŋ/, the velars /ŋ/ and /k/ delete and the sufﬁx’s
underlying retroﬂex /ɳ/ (not /n/) surfaces, as shown in (2.5).

Thus, there are sound internal and comparative reasons to analyse the negative sufﬁx
in Kayardild as underlyingly /ɳaŋ/ and not /naŋ/, which in turn entails that a vowel-
ﬁnal analysis of verbal stems fails to predict the correct surface form of negatively
inﬂected verbs without recourse to exceptional stipulation.
In sum, the vowel-ﬁnal analysis handles the initial data sets in Tables 2.5 and 2.6
only by positing abstract declensions and sufﬁxal allomorphy. It must stipulate that a
laminal plosive is inserted into reduplicated verbal stems (Table 2.10 (a–k)), and must
stipulate that certain reduplicated stems lack such insertion (Table 2.10 (l–o)). It must
also provide a non-regular means of deriving surface, non-retroﬂex [n] in negatively

2.2 Roots and thematics 21
inﬂected verbs. In contrast, the laminal-ﬁnal analysis of verbal stems must only
stipulate that in certain reduplicated forms the ﬁnal laminal fails to copy. All other
data are accounted for regularly, both phonologically and morphologically. Since the
one stipulation required by the laminal-ﬁnal analysis is also required by the vowel-
ﬁnal analysis, the decision here is to adopt the laminal-ﬁnal analysis as the correct
analysis.
2.2.3 Morphological autonomy of thematics
Next we establish that the ﬁnal laminal plosive /t̪/ or /c/ of a verbal stem is a
morphological unit unto itself, which I refer to as a thematic (see also Evans
1995:254–6, 399–401).
We saw above that the question of which of two thematics, /t̪/ and /c/, appears at the
end of a stem cannot in general be predicted from the shape of the remainder of the
stem; thus the lexicon needs to list stems and their thematics together. One might
suppose at ﬁrst that the thematics /t̪/ and /c/ are merely the ﬁnal phonological segments
of their stems, but there are three morphological constructions in which the behaviour
of thematics points to their being morphological, and not merely phonological, units.
The ﬁrst construction is verbal reduplication, where the lexically associated the-
matic was missing from the ﬁrst copy of a reduplicated stem even at the underlying
phonological level in Table 2.10 (l–o). The second and third constructions are middle
and reciprocal stems, examples of which are shown in Table 2.14. Here, the thematic
associated with the plain stem appears to be missing from the underlying phono-
logical form of the middle and reciprocal stems.
We can ﬁrst establish that in the general case, the absence of thematics from these
three constructions is not amenable to a phonological account, which fails on several
fronts. For one, laminal plosives never delete before a labial plosive elsewhere in
Kayardild phonology but the thematic /t̪/ is absent before labials in reduplications
(2.6a). Likewise, laminal plosives never delete between vowels elsewhere in Kayardild
phonology but both thematics are absent before the /i/ vowel of the middle sufﬁx
(2.6b,c).

A phonological account can be ruled out, but we have yet to establish the plausibility of
a morphological account according to which one constituent of a stem (the thematic)
fails to appear when that stem occurs in certain larger morphological constructions.
Such an analysis is lent credibility by the fact that comparable behaviour occurs
elsewhere in the morphological system. For example, the elements /t̪u/, /cu/ appear
at the end of many kin-denoting stems, and a locative sufﬁx /ki/ appears at the end of
certain place names. All three morphs are absent, either optionally or obligatorily,
when certain other sufﬁxes follow, as illustrated in Table 2.15.
The failure of /t̪u/, /cu/ to appear before certain sufﬁxes parallels the failure of
thematics to appear before the sufﬁxes that form the middle and reciprocal stems. As
for reduplication, the fact that the thematic sometimes appears and sometimes does
not suggests that reduplication copies a morphologically complex string (consisting
of root+thematic) on some occasions, and a morphologically simple unit on others.
In fact this is generally true of Kayardild reduplication, which routinely copies both
simple and complex morphological constituents (cf }2.2.5 below).
In sum, a morphological analysis of the absence of thematics in verbal reduplica-
tion, middle stems, and reciprocal stems accords well with the general nature of
the morphological system, provided we view thematics not merely as the ﬁnal
phonological segment of verbal stems, but as autonomous morphological units.
A phonological analysis of missing thematics lacks support.

2.2 Roots and thematics 23
2.2.4 Thematic-ﬁnal lexical stems are all verbal, and vice-versa
We have established that the simplest of lexical, verbal stems consist of a root plus a
thematic. For lexical stems in Kayardild the implicational relationship between being
verbal and being thematic-ﬁnal is biunique: all thematic-ﬁnal lexical stems are verbal,
and all verbal lexical stems are thematic ﬁnal. This generalization ensures that
whenever complex lexical stems are built of multiple morphological components
we need only inspect the stem’s right edge to determine whether it is verbal (in which
case it will end with a thematic) or nominal (it will not). An important restriction
here is that the biunique relationship is true only of lexical stems. When we come to
inﬂected stems the implication breaks down in both directions.
2.2.5 More complex stems of roots and thematic
The Kayardild lexicon is richly populated with more complex stems also built of
roots and thematics. Reduplicated verbal stems were introduced above. Here we
survey reduplicated nominal stems, compounds, ‘cranberry’ roots, and more com-
plex reduplicated structures.
Nominal root reduplication in Kayardild is common and has a range of idiosyn-
cratic and regular meanings (Evans 1995a:200–1). Phonologically it consists of the
concatenation of two underlying copies of the root across either kind of juncture, as
in (2.7) and (2.8).4
In glosses, short angled brackets ‘‹›’ will be used as a convention to
group multiple elements on one line which correspond to just one element on the line
immediately above or below. Orthographic forms are given in italics. Surface phono-
logical forms appear next, and underlying forms below them.

The juncture type associated with the reduplication of a given nominal root cannot
be predicted on any independent basis and must be listed in the lexical entry of the
reduplicated stem.

See Round (2009:129–31, 364–68) for further discussion and analysis.
24 Morphological structures
Nominal compounds are also common and highly productive. Semantically most
Kayardild compounds are exocentric (Evans 1995a:197–200), with X-Y denoting ‘an
entity whose X is ((like) a) Y’ or the property of ‘having an X which is (like) Y’. An
endocentric minority arguably denote ‘an X entity which is Y’. Only regular phono-
logical junctures ‘-’ appear in compounds.5

The Kayardild lexicon contains just one verbal–verbal compound, kabathaath- ‘go
and hunt (and return)’, built on /kapa-t̪-/ ‘ﬁnd; hunt’ plus /t̪aa-t̪-/ ‘go and do and
return’.
Nominal roots productively compound with verbal stems, in which case the verbal
stem always appears rightmost, therefore resulting in a thematic-ﬁnal, hence verbal stem.
The semantics of such compounds are varied (see Evans 1995a:290–6) and nominal roots
can contribute adverbial as well as entity-based meanings. The phonological junctures
between nominal roots and verbal stems are regular ‘-’. Examples are shown in (2.10). In
glosses the thematics appear as th for the dental /t̪/ and j for the palatal /c/.

A single exception appears to be jarurndurn- ‘long legged wasp sp.’, in which /ca/ ‘foot, leg’ is
compounded across an exceptional juncture with /ʈuɳ-ʈuɳ/ ‘big’.
2.2 Roots and thematics 25
Examples (2.10c,d) contain elements subscripted as NL. These are ‘cranberry’
morphs, sometimes termed ‘non-lexical’ roots (Jackendoff 1975; Round 2009),
which appear in compounds but not in maximally simple stems. Some non-lexical
roots occur in enough stems for a more or less coherent meaning to be inferred, while
for others this is not the case. Nominal examples of the former kind include /ju/
‘water’ and /kuna/ ‘child’, shown in (2.11). The fact that the roots do not occur
independently is shown in (2.11c,f).

Compound stems may also be reduplicated as in (2.12). In such cases the phono-
logical junctures between the two copies will be the regular ‘-’.

2.3 Sufﬁxes
Unlike roots, sufﬁxes need not begin with an underlying consonant, and may be as
short as a single segment. Representative examples appear in (2.13). Glosses in (2.13)
are morphomic.

μmid-j μinch-th μdat-th μaddict
Many sufﬁxes such as (2.13f–h) are lexically associated with a thematic, and all such
sufﬁxes end in a vowel. Those which are not associated with a thematic may end in a
vowel or any of the underlying consonants or clusters listed in Table 2.16 (note that
these form a proper subset of the phonological endings found on nominal roots).
Phonological junctures between sufﬁxes and underlyingly adjacent elements may
be either regular or exceptional as in (2.14a–c) and (2.14d–f) respectively.

For many sufﬁxes there is just one juncture type that will always appear to the sufﬁx’s
left. This is the case for the sufﬁxes in (2.14). The ‘morphomic genitive’ μgen is always
preceded by a regular juncture ‘-’, and the ‘morphomic proprietive’ μprop is
always preceded by an exceptional juncture ‘+’. With other sufﬁxes this is not the
case. For derivational sufﬁxes the choice may be predictable according to the sufﬁx’s
function, or it may be idiosyncratic. The morphomic privative (μpriv) sufﬁx /wari/
for example is preceded by an exceptional juncture when used derivationally as the
‘negative nominalizer’ (2.15a), and by a regular juncture when it appears in inchoa-
tivized privative stems such as in (2.15b).

Sufﬁx allomorphy is discussed in }2.5.
2.4 The termination
One of the more idiosyncratic features of Kayardild word structure is the presence at
the end of each syntactic word of a termination element, glossed as t. The termin-
ation carries no meaning and has four phonological realizations: /a/, /ta/, /ka/, and
zero. In most cases the allomorph of t appearing at the end of a word is determined
by the phonological form of the stem to which t attaches. A full set of representative,
phonologically conditioned cases is shown in Table 2.17.
In instances conditioned purely by the phonology of the stem to which it attaches,
the termination takes one of four forms. After stems of more than two morae which
end in a low vowel and after stems that end in /uu/, the termination has no overt
realization. After all other vowel-ﬁnal stems it appears as /a/. After consonant-ﬁnal
stems, it appears as /ta/ following a coronal and /ka/ following a velar.
Not all instances of t are selected on the basis of a stem’s phonology. The sufﬁxes
in Table 2.18 exceptionally select either the /a/ or zero allomorphs of a following

termination. Selecting for the zero allomorph can result in the underlying word form
ending in a consonant which will be phonologically deleted at the surface. This
occurs in Table 2.18 (a–c).
A number of high frequency nominal roots also select an idiosyncratic /a/ or zero
allomorph of t if t appears directly after the root. These are dathin- /ʈat̪in/ ‘that;
there’ which selects the /a/ allomorph, and the particles kada- /kata/ ‘again’, bana-
/pana/ ‘and’, and mara- /maɻa/ counterfactual which select the zero allomorph.
Some remaining morphological idiosyncrasies of t are discussed in }3.2.3 and }3.2.4.
In }3.4 arguments are provided for why t is not a nominative case sufﬁx and why t
appearing directly after the thematics th and j is not a tense/aspect/mood sufﬁx.
2.5 Suppletive allomorphy of mprop, mabl, and mcons
The morphomic proprietive, ablative, and consequential (μprop, μabl, μcons) are
each realized by two allomorphs, shown in Table 2.19. The allomorph with the greater
segmental content is labelled ‘strong’ and the other one ‘weak’. The alternations
between strong and weak forms do not follow from any phonological rule in
Kayardild, although the distribution of the two is partly conditioned by phonological
factors as we will see.
The conditions under which the allomorphs are used are summarized in Table 2.20
and discussed in turn below.

When μprop, μabl, or μcons function derivationally or when words are in song
only the strong allomorphs are used. When μcons realizes case:consequential,
tamt:antecedent, or tama:antecedent only the strong form is used. Otherwise
whether the strong or the weak form is used depends on a number of factors, listed
in Table 2.20 as conditions C, P1, and P2. For μprop, the strong form may always be
used as an alternative for the weak (Evans 1995a:145).
Condition C is morphological and applies to realizations of case, speciﬁcally
case:proprietive by μprop and case:ablative by μloc-μabl. It is met if the μprop
or μabl morphome that realizes case fails to appear immediately before the termin-
ation, t, and when it is met the strong form is used; otherwise the weak form appears.
Examples of μprop and μabl appearing as the realization of case are shown in (2.18).
In (2.18a,b) the morphomes sit immediately before t and the weak form appears (and
optionally the strong for μprop). In (2.18c,d) this is not the case, thus condition C is
met and the strong allomorph appears.

Condition P1 is phonological. It relates to the prohibition in Kayardild surface phono-
logical forms on strings consisting of a long vowel followed immediately by a short vowel
or of two identical short vowels followed by a third short vowel, a constraint we may
refer to as *VÆVÆV. If the occurrence of an allomorph would lead after the application of
all phonological rules to the appearance of such a string, then that allomorph is not used.
This is relevant for the strong allomorph of μprop which is underlyingly /+kuu/ and
whose initial /k/ is deleted if a vowel precedes it. If the preceding vowel is /u/ this should
give us /u+kuu/ ! [uuu], an illicit sequence. Examples (2.19a,b) illustrate condition P1
being met, and therefore triggering the use of the strong allomorph of μprop following a
/u/-ﬁnal stem, but not being met after other vowel-ﬁnal stems. Surface phonological
forms are shown in the second line of the glosses.

Condition P2 also relates to the avoidance of vocalic strings in surface phonological
forms, this time to the avoidance of a long vowel, or two indentical short vowels,
followed by a semivowel (VÆVÆS). Such strings do in fact appear in Kayardild surface
forms as illustrated in (2.20), but their creation is avoided if possible by the use of
weak allomorphs.

One may ask what evidence there is that the triggering condition in (2.21) is
phonological and not, for example, the presence of the following μloc, or the fact
that μloc realizes the inﬂectional feature +comp. The evidence comes from the
behaviour of μcons, which also possesses strong and weak forms. Unlike μprop
and μabl the weak form of μcons /ŋara/ does not end in a VÆVÆ string and
consequently its allomorphy will not be affected by P2, which is sensitive to
VÆVÆS strings. This is shown in (2.22a). Morphologically, example (2.22a) is entirely
parallel to (2.21a): the morphome whose strong/weak form we are interested in
realizes a value of the inﬂectional feature tamt and it is followed by a μloc
realization of +comp, yet condition P2 is not triggered. This is because P2 is deﬁned
with respect to phonology, and not morphosyntax or morphomes.

In cases where μprop, μabl, and μcons realize tamt:potential, tama:future,

Before concluding, I wish to draw attention to the speciﬁc nature of the phonological
conditions P1 and P2. These conditions are met when a surface phonological form
would contain the dispreferred strings VÆVÆV or VÆVÆS. Importantly, it is only the
surface form which matters. For example in (2.23a–c) all of the underlying phono-
logical forms contain VÆVÆV strings, yet this is unproblematic; the word in each case
is well-formed because there is no VÆVÆV string at the surface. Likewise in examples
(2.21a,b) the words containing weak allomorphs were dispreferred because they
contained VÆVÆS strings on the surface; in the underlying forms there were no
dispreferred VÆVÆS strings but this did not rescue them. The inﬂuence of P1 and
P2 on the choice of allomorphs is thus a case of phonologically conditioned allo-
morphy driven not by underlying forms but by phonologically derived surface
forms. Although the existence of such allomorphy has long been noted in generative
phonology (Anderson 1975; Carstairs 1987, 1998) it has recently been claimed not to
exist (Paster 2006, 2012). Kayardild provides counter-evidence to that recent claim
(for further discussion see Round 2009:223–8).
2.6 Morphomes
Aronoff (1994) argues for the linguistic signiﬁcance of morphomic categories, categor-
ies which ﬁgure in the systematic organization of a language’s morphology but which
are not isomorphic with any morphosyntactic, semantic, or phonological categories. In
the present analysis Aronoff’s morphomic categories are formalized as elements in a
morphomic level of representation which mediates morphsyntactic/semantic repre-
sentations and phonological representations.
2.6 Morphomes 33
OneofthemostbasicfunctionsofamorphomeintheanalysisofKayardildistocapture
the non-accidentalsharing of an identicalphonological realization by multiple inﬂectional
or derivational features. For example, all of the features on the left in Figure 2.1 are realized
bythesamemorphome,μloc,whichisthenrealizedphonologicallyas/ki/.Themediating
role of μloc expresses the fact that the eventual realization of all of these features by /ki/ is
not accidental. This generalization would go unexpressed if /ki/ were listed independently
as the realization of all six features. Another case, involving μobl is shown in Figure 2.2.
These mappings of multiple features onto the same morphome pervade the
morphological system of Kayardild. In the inﬂectional system for example over 40
per cent of all feature values share an identical morphomic realization with at least
one other inﬂectional feature value, and over 50 per cent share at least part of their
exponence with a derivational operation. Examples illustrating some of the features’
realizations schematized in Figure 2.1 are shown in (2.24). (Note that on the last line
of the gloss the termination is not represented in any way.)

Morphomes capture more than just identities of individual forms. They also
capture identities of shared, multiple forms, identities of aspects of forms,
identities of subparts of forms, and identities of restrictions on morphotactics.
The following subsections discuss each of these facts. More theoretically and
technically oriented treatments of these issues can also be found in Round (2011;
in prep a.; in prep b), where I show that other apparatus such as rules of referal
(Zwicky 1985; Stump 1993) and the divorcing of function from realization (Beard
1995) do not on their own afford sufﬁcient power to adequately express the
morphological facts of Kayardild.
2.6.1 Identity of sets of phonological realizations
The features in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2 share more than the phonological realiza-
tions /ki/ and /in̪t̪a/. When any of the features from Figure 2.1 is realized next to
any from Figure 2.2, as μloc-μobl, the eventual phonological realization of both
features is /kurka/, a suppletive, cumulative realization of both μloc and μobl. Some
examples are shown in (2.25). Facts such as this underscore the point that morpho-
mic elements such as μloc and μobl are not simply placeholders for speciﬁc
phonological forms, but are elements whose relationship to phonological forms is
one of mapping, where the mapping may be one-to-one, or may be more complex.
That features map to μloc or to μobl captures the fact that they share not just a
single phonological realization but identical sets of phonological realizations.

2.6.2 Identity of subparts of phonological realizations
Features may also share a subpart of their phonological realization with other
features. This arises when derivational or inﬂectional features are realized as strings
of multiple sufﬁxal morphs. Comparable phenomena in Australian languages have
been discussed elsewhere, usually in connection with sufﬁxes that realize case, and
have been discussed under the rubrics of ‘pre-case’ (Blake 1987), ‘case spacing’
(Dench and Evans 1988), ‘derivational case’ (Austin 1995), ‘ligative’ afﬁxation
(Blake 1987; Schweiger 2000), and ‘compound case’ (Schweiger 2000). Here, I will
2.6 Morphomes 35
use the term compound sufﬁxation to refer to cases where a string of multiple
sufﬁxal morphs fulﬁls just one function. Examples in derivation and inﬂection are
shown in (2.26) and (2.27).

‹see›-‹nonver› that-‹abl›-t here-‹abls›
In these examples the appearance of speciﬁc elements in the morphomic representa-
tion captures the fact that parts of the phonological form are also used elsewhere for
other purposes. In almost all cases in (2.26) and (2.27) the individual sufﬁx mor-
phomes which comprise the compound sufﬁxes also realize other functions when
used by themselves.
2.6.3 Identity of aspects of phonological realization
Inﬂectional and derivational features may also share just certain aspects of their
phonological realization. To take an inﬂectional example, both case:privative and
the feature set {+neg, tamt:actual} are realized by the morph /wari/. However, case:
privative is realized by /wari/ preceded by the regular juncture ‘-’ whereas {+neg,
tamt:actual} is realized by /wari/ preceded by the exceptional juncture ‘+’. This leads
to different modiﬁcations of the underlying clusters that span the juncture, as can be
seen in (2.28) where /t̪-w/ becomes [j] and /t̪+w/ becomes [t̪].

animal-priv ‹gather›-neg.act
36 Morphological structures
The analysis here is that the morphomic units which realize case:privative and
{+neg, tamt:actual} are complex. Both units are built on the same primary mor-
phome, μpriv. This can be seen in the morphomic glosses in (2.28). The units differ
however in their juncture feature. The realization of case:privative is by μpriv with
a ‘regular’ juncture feature, while the realization of {+neg, tamt:actual} is μpriv with
an ‘exceptional’ juncture feature. To avoid visual clutter morphomic juncture fea-
tures are not indicated in the morphomic gloss line. Their effect can be seen on the
phonological line however.
A similar formal treatment can be extended to allomorphy. As introduced in }2.5,
some morphomes are realized as different allomorphs under various conditions. In
Chapter 11 it is argued that the nature of the system is that under some conditions the
morphology passes an allomorph set (containing strong and weak allomorphs) to the
phonology, from which the phonology selects one allomorph; under other conditions
the morphology just passes one allomorph (always the strong allomorph). This
means that in the general case a morphomic unit must also carry an allomorphy
feature which indicates whether one allomorph or two will be passed to the phon-
ology when it is realized. Allomorphy features are represented in morphomic glosses
by a double acute accent above the μ in instances where the phonology passes two
allomorphs (although the phonological gloss only shows the allomorph which the
phonology ends up selecting). Examples are shown in (2.29), where case:proprietive
is realized in (2.29a) with a morphomic allomorphy feature that results in it passing
to the phonology just one allomorph, the strong form /kuɻu/; tama:future is realized
in (2.29b) such that it passes two allomorphs, from which the phonology in this
instance selects the weak form /kuu/.

A formal account of Kayardild morphology thus requires not only a morphomic level
of representation, but a decomposition of the elements in that representation into
three parts, or distinctive features: a primary morphome, a juncture feature, and an
allomorphy feature.
2.6.4 Identity of morphotactic restrictions
Evans (1995a:105–7) points out that the Kayardild inﬂectional system places special
linear sequencing restrictions on certain inﬂectional sufﬁxes. Stated in terms of the
current analysis, there are ordering restrictions on certain morphomes. The mor-
phomic desiderative (μdes) and morphomic oblique (μobl) can only appear imme-
diately before the termination, t, while the morphomic locative (μloc) can only
2.6 Morphomes 37
appear before t, μobl, μall, or μabl. How these restrictions are obeyed varies from
case to case. The μdes simply blocks any expected morphome to its right other than t
from being realized; μobl shifts its linear position to the right edge of the word
immediately before t, and the μloc simply fails to be realized if it would be followed
by the realization of an illicit morphome. The crucial observation is that these
generalizations can be stated in such a simple manner only in terms of morphomic
categories, not in terms of the multiple, disparate features which those morphomic
categories may realize, and not in terms of the disparate set of phonological morphs
which the morphomes are realized as. To my knowledge Kayardild provides the
clearest example yet of a linguistically signiﬁcant morphomic level of representation,
in the sense that a signiﬁcant range of generalizations are accorded their simplest and
most elegant expression in terms of the same, morphomically represented units.
2.6.5 tam inﬂection and morphomic stem shape
It is not uncommon in inﬂectional systems for the question of whether or not an
inﬂectional feature, for example number, receives a realization at all, to depend on
the presence or absence of certain other inﬂectional features, for example certain case
values. It can also occur that the (non)realization of an inﬂectional feature depends
on the phonological form of the stem on which it would be realized. Thus, given
that realization can depend on other inﬂectional features, that is, it can depend on
the nature of the morphosyntactic representation, and given that it can depend
on the phonological shape of a stem, that is, on the nature of the phonological
representation, it should not be surprising if inﬂectional realization in Kayardild also
depended on the nature of the morphomic representation, as indeed it does.
A signiﬁcant point of differentiation between the present analysis and that of
Evans (1995a) is that here the shape of the stem in its morphomic representation will
play a crucial role in regulating the realization of the two tense/aspect/mood (tam)
features in the inﬂectional system. One feature, the ‘thematic’ tam feature, will be
realizable on stems which end morphomically with one of the thematics, th and j,
while the ‘athematic’ tam feature will be realizable only on stems which do not end in
a thematic. By stating the generalization in this way it is possible to dispense with one
of the more striking aspects of Evans’ (1995a) analysis of Kayardild, in which
inﬂectional sufﬁxes are analysed as altering a stem’s ‘morphological word class’,
from morphological nominal to morphological verbal or vice versa. Reasons for
abandoning that analysis will be discussed more closely in Chapter 9.
2.6.6 Morphomicity in Evans (1995a)
Evans (1995a) formulates a distinctive notion of case which replicates several of the
characteristics of the present, morphomic analysis of Kayardild although the detail
38 Morphological structures
and in particular the reasoning behind Evans’ treatment of case are signiﬁcantly
different to the treatment here. We may begin with the similarities.
A number of morphosyntactic features which are analysed here as something
other than case are analysed in Evans (1995a) as functions of case morphemes. In
certain respects, Evans’ case morphemes approximate the level of representation
which is identiﬁed here as the morphome. For example the range of forms identiﬁed
in Evans (1995a) as containing the oblique case morpheme comes close to those
identiﬁed here as containing the morphomic oblique (μobl) morphome; compare
Figure 2.2 above with a similarly laid out diagram of Evans’ oblique case, its
functions, and its phonological realizations in Figure 2.3. (The right side of the
diagram lists surface phonological variants rather than a single underlying form,
which for present purposes is an insigniﬁcant difference.)
The approach taken by Evans (1995a) and formulated originally in Evans (1985)
appears during a period of theoretical development in the Australianist literature
occurring around the same time, notably in Dench and Evans (1988), Dench (1995),
and Austin (1995), which tackled issues in the analysis of sufﬁxes in Australian
languages which mark case and have distinctive polyfunctionality. The approach
replicates much of the mapping achieved with morphomes but with one signiﬁcant
gap: Evans’ tense sufﬁxes are treated differently, even though they share with case
all of properties listed in }}2.6.1–2.6.4 above. Since Evans provides a careful articula-
tion of the arguments underlying his model of case it is possible to compare them
with the basis of the morphomic model used here.
The conceptual basis of case in Evans (1995a) is fundamentally different from that
of morphomes in the present analysis. In addition to observations regarding similar-
ities and identities of form, Evans (1995a:117–19) presents a set of semantic and
syntactic arguments for positively identifying and grouping his morphome-like
elements as case markers, and another set of semantic and syntactic arguments for
excluding tense. In contrast, the notion of a morphome employed here is that of a
category which speciﬁcally is not coherently grounded in semantics, syntax, or
phonological form, one which instead is a purely morphological category which
ﬁgures prominently in the organization of the morphological system (Aronoff
1994). Let us brieﬂy consider then whether Evans’ semantic and syntactic arguments
for grouping the functions of case and excluding tense are compelling.

FIGURE 2.3 Oblique case in Evans (1995a)
2.6 Morphomes 39
In order to unite into one category the many functions of case, including ‘modal
case’ which will be analysed in this book as a tense/aspect/mood feature, Evans
(1995a:117–18) appeals to a deﬁnition of case due to Mel’cuk (1986). Key criteria are
that the phenomenon in question should display morphological concord, and that it
be used to distinguish types of syntactic dependency. All of Evans’ functions of case
do meet these criteria, but as we will see in Chapters 4–7 so do all inﬂectional features
in Kayardild including number and the equivalent of Evans’ tense. Thus the
positive reasons for grouping case fail to stop at just case; they extend to all features
and so fail to distinguish any proper subset.
The uniﬁcation of tense with case is rejected by Evans (1995a:255) for three
reasons. The ﬁrst is that there fails to exist a matching case value, with a similar
set of phonological realizations, for each value of tense. Problematic here is that
among the different functions of case the same failure applies, and applies often. For
example there is no value of complementizing case to match the proprietive value
of relational case. If this criterion is applied uniformly, the single case category
will be dissolved. The second reason is that there exists a one-to-many relationship
between certain case and tense values. That is, in terms of its phonological realiza-
tion and its diachronic source, the consequential case matches both the precondition
tense and the past tense (in the terms of the morphomic analysis here, all three
inﬂectional features are realized by μcons). Again however, the same, supposedly
problematic relationship can be found among the functions of case. The relational
ablative shares its forms with two kinds of modal ablative. Although the modal
ablative is given a unitary label in Evans (1995a), it has two distinct functions, each
with distinctive allomorphy (Evans 1995a:260–1). Thus if the second criterion is
applied uniformly, it will also dissolve the single case category. The third is that
‘the meanings of the [tense] inﬂections are sometimes difﬁcult to relate synchronic-
ally’ to case (Evans 1995a:255). This semantic argument carries little force. Both
tense and the modal function of case relate to the semantic ﬁeld of tense/aspect/
mood and their afﬁnities are therefore closer to one another than modal case is to
either of relational case (which corresponds to a more tradition notion of case) or
complementizing case (which indexes relationships between clauses). If the third
criterion is applied uniformly, the single case category will once again be dissolved.6
Neither the positive arguments for grouping the functions of case together nor the
negative arguments for dissociating them from tense are convincing. The approach
6
It might appear that this predicament can be avoided by returning to Evans’ semantic grounds for
grouping case functions together. The claim is made that case systems are often semantically more
heterogeneous than canonical descriptions of case suggest: ‘the case systems of most languages abound
in such problematic polysemy’ (Evans 1995a:118), and this might be cited to justify tolerating a greater
degree of semantic divergence in case categories than in others. However the question then arises as to
whether one can ever draw a semantic boundary between case and other features. If not, then we cannot
dissociate tense from case on semantic grounds as was proposed.
40 Morphological structures
presented in this volume proceeds instead from the recognition that there exists no
coherent, synchronic semantic or morphosyntactic basis to morphomic categories in
Kayardild.
2.6.7 Realization for Evans’ (1995a) case values is not uniform
Here I make a short but signiﬁcant observation regarding the degree to which values
for Evans’ unitary case category have uniform phonological exponences. At one
juncture Evans states that case sufﬁxes ‘have the same form and range of allomorphy
regardless of their function’ (Evans 1995a:118).7
This statement has at times been
taken at face value by other researchers,8
but it is not correct. Two facts have been
abstracted away from. First, the allomorphy of Evans’ ablative case morpheme is
different when it takes a modal function (signalling tense/aspect/mood) in precon-
dition clauses, compared against its other uses (Evans 1995a:261). Secondly, the
allomorphy of the proprietive case morpheme is not the same in its modal function
as in its relational and adnominal functions generally (Evans 1995a:145).
In passing, it may be of interest to scholars of morphemic theory to observe the
extended notion of the morpheme which is implicitly at play in Evans’ (1995a)
analysis of Kayardild case. First, case morphemes have multiple functions. Sec-
ondly, many of them have multiple forms, entailing the existence of many-to-many
relationships between form and function. Finally, for case morphemes such as the
ablative and proprietive, some of their multiple forms relate exclusively to only some
of their multiple functions, a situation which prototypically would call for the
postulation of separate morphemes. Arguably this indicates just how deeply non-
morphemic the morphology of Kayardild is. Despite Evans’ innovative approach to
the case morpheme as an analytical device and the insights which have been
obtained by applying it, there are signiﬁcant additional insights which do not emerge
until a morphomic analysis is used.
2.6.8 Morphomicization and implications for the analyst
Much has altered during the evolution of the modern Kayardild morphological
system. Thematic markers would once have consistently correlated with the end of
a lexical stem in a syntactically verbal word. Now they also appear in case sufﬁxes on
nouns. The sufﬁx /n/ would once have been solely a derivational nominalizer,
deriving the stems on which syntactic nouns were based. It is now the realization
of μn, a morphomic category which retains the original nominalizing function but
7
The sentence continues, ‘except for variations resulting from exposed vs internal position, which are
clearly derivative.’ To the extent that Evans is referring here to effects such as the deletion of sufﬁx-ﬁnal
segments by the phonology I agree that such variations are not signiﬁcant. It is the variations conditioned
by function which are signiﬁcant.
8
For example, by Sadler and Nordlinger (2006b), on which see }9.4.
2.6 Morphomes 41
also appears in four different tam sufﬁxes on verbs. The string /n-ŋarpa/ (now μn-
μcons) would once have been solely a nominalizer followed by a case marker but is
now also a unitary, complex sufﬁx realizing tam.
The multiplication of polysemies, the accumulation of compound sufﬁxes, and the
co-opting of derivational exponents into the inﬂectional system would all have
intensiﬁed the morphological complexity of Kayardild’s ancestral line to the point
where some language learners would have posited morphomic representations where
their parents had not. Perhaps it was only after that tipping point that much of the
complexity of modern Kayardild was elaborated, as the morphomic organization of
the langauge invited reanalyses triggering the development of more of the same (see
Evans 1995b regarding the recency of some of Kayardild’s complex morphology).
Irrespective of what eventually is concluded regarding Kayardild’s past, the chal-
lenge for the analyst of the modern language is that the link between phonological
form and inﬂectional or derivational function has become complex and pervasively
so. Many of the departures which the present analysis of Kayardild will make from
Evans (1995a) are consequences of identifying different solutions to the task of
sorting form from function. When deciding whether to depart from the results
of earlier research I have found the most forceful motivations to lie in the operation
of the morphological system as a whole, and the best analysis to be the one which
captures such empirical generalizations with the greastest simplicity and insight.

Speciﬁc stems and sufﬁxes
This chapter takes up speciﬁc aspects of the morphology of Kayardild which,
although they will not be the focus of attention in later chapters, will be present in
the data nonetheless. Since none of them is central to later analyses, some readers
may wish to skip ahead now to Chapter 4. This chapter examines speciﬁc sufﬁxes in
}3.1, speciﬁc stems and stem–sufﬁx dependencies in }3.2, and the place of song forms
in Kayardild grammar in }3.3. Section 3.4 substantiates the current analysis of the
termination in words that lack overt realizations of inﬂectional features.
3.1 Sufﬁxes
3.1.1 Morphomic middle, μmid
The middle stem of a verb is formed by replacing the ﬁnal thematic of the active stem
with the morphomic middle (μmid) sufﬁx plus the j thematic. All allomorphs of
μmid consist segmentally of /i/, and since verb stems minus their thematic all end in
vowels, the sufﬁxation of μmid leads to underlying /V-i/ strings. Such strings are
subject to some of the most complex phonology of Kayardild, with the repair of vowel
hiatus in /V-i/ and /V-iː/ strings following one of ﬁve patterns (Round 2009:276–82).
Which of the ﬁve patterns is followed is determined morphologically, which under
the present account entails a representation at the morphomic level of a choice
of phonological juncture, as for example by a hiatus juncture feature on μmid. The
morphome μmid has several uses. When used to form the middle stem of a verb
it associates by default with a class II hiatus juncture feature, giving rise to the
phonological forms illustrated in Table 3.1.1
Other allomorphs of μmid attach to derivational, verbal sufﬁxes. An allomorph
with a class V juncture feature attaches to the morphomic factitive (μfact) and the

Middle forms of intransitive verbs such as wanjiij- ‘ascend’ are rarely used in Kayardild but they do
occur. The middle form of an intransitive verb will appear in nominalizations referring to places where
some intransitive action takes place. For example, the stem budubudu-‹warraan›- ‘boat-‹go-μmid-μn›’
means ‘harbour’, literally, where boats go; yalikida-‹wanjiin›- ‘crocodile-‹ascend-μmid-μn›’ describes a
place where crocodiles come ashore. Even reciprocals participate in the pattern: barrngka-‹balanthiin›-
‘water lily-‹hit-μrcp-μmid-μn›’ describes a swamp where water lilies hit against one another.
morphomic reciprocal (μrcp) sufﬁxes. Examples are shown in Table 3.2.2
The
underlying string /u+i/ which yielded /iiː/ in Table 3.1 above now yields /iː/ due to
the different hiatus juncture type.
3.1.2 Thematic inﬂectional sufﬁxes and their middle forms
Certain inﬂectional case categories, termed thematic case categories, are realized
morphomically by a string of two or more sufﬁxes, the last of which is a thematic.
Eight of these categories come in pairs whose formal relationship to one another can
be expressed in terms of one sufﬁx being basic and the other being comprised of the
basic sufﬁx plus μmid. These are listed in Table 3.3.
3.1.3 Morphomic reciprocal, mrcp
Much like for the middle, the reciprocal stem of a verb is made by replacing the
thematic of the basic stem with one of the three morphomic reciprocal morphomes

The formation of reciprocal stems is one area of the grammar where younger speakers’ Kayardild
differs noticeably from that of senior speakers, which is described here. Younger speakers often attach
μrcp3 /n̪t̪u-t̪-/ to polysyllabic roots other than bala-th- ‘hit’, and sometimes form reciprocals of monosyl-
labic roots as if they were polysyllabic, e.g. baa-nju-th- ‘bite-μrcp1-th’, or leave long vowels unshortened,
e.g. raa-nthu-th- ‘spear-μrcp3-th’.
4
This synchronically idiosyncratic vowel length alternation has a sound diachronic pedigree. Mono-
syllabic verbal roots can be reconstructed in proto Tangkic as having had short vowels. The long vowels in a
verbal stem like baaj- ‘bite’ were innovated between proto Tangkic and proto Southern Tangkic—compare
Lardil (Northern Tangkic) beth-a ‘bite’. The short vowel in a reciprocal like ranthuth- ‘spear rcp’ is thus
conservative.
3.1 Sufﬁxes 45
has an irregular reciprocal ju-nthu-th which appears to be based on /cuː/, plus
sufﬁxation of μrcp3-th /n̪t̪u-t̪-/ and vowel shortening. In the case of compound
stems which end in a monosyllabic verbal root there is variation:5
sometimes one
ﬁnds μrcp3 /n̪t̪u-t̪-/ with a shortened vowel, other times, μrcp1 /ɲcu-t̪-/ with the full
vowel. A summary is shown in Table 3.5.
The verbal root /wuː-/ ‘give’ has a reciprocal form in which the root vowel is
shortened and root plus thematic is reduplicated.6
Moreover, the usual thematic j
(which is the only thematic that can appear after long vowels and which therefore
normally appears after long /wuː-/) is replaced by thematic th (which can appear
after the short vowel of shortened /wu-/). An ‘exceptional’ juncture appears between
the two copies of root+thematic, and the thematic in the second copy is then replaced
by μrcp /n̪t̪u-t̪/, yielding the form shown in (3.1).

Idiosyncratically, the root /pala-t̪/ ‘hit’ selects either μrcp2 or μrcp3 yielding both
bala-nthu-th- and bala-thu-th- ‘hit-μrcp-th’. I have recorded individual speakers
using both of these forms.

I have too few tokens of such words to determine what the basis of variation is. It could be lexical,
phonological, or inter-speaker variation.

In proto Tangkic reduplicated monosyllabic roots had a long ﬁrst vowel and short second, cf. Lardil’s
beej-be- ‘bite rdp’. Kayardild’s wuthunthuth- contains an etymologically short second vowel plus recently
shortened ﬁrst vowel. Yukulta’s wuuthunthuth- ‘share something, lit. give rcp’ retains the original vowel
lengths.

the usual μgen is
preceded by /pa/ which is analysed here as a separate morph8

3.1.5 Non-inﬂectional, number-like sufﬁxes
On the analysis advocated here, Kayardild possesses just two inﬂectional sufﬁxes
which convey number, the morphomic plural (μpl) and morphomic dual (μdu)—the
criterial behaviour of an inﬂectional number sufﬁx is that it exhibits concord within
the DP or NP, cf }6.6.
Evans (1995a:183–7) also describes the morphomic plenty (μplenty) /wut̪iɲ/ as
inﬂectional; however neither Evans’ data nor my corpus furnish any examples which
can support (or refute) that claim. Two sufﬁxes described as having ‘semantic
afﬁnities’ with number sufﬁx are the ‘every’ use of μpl-μsame and the ‘morphomic
another’ (μanoth) sufﬁx, neither of which are inﬂectional according to the criterion
of exhibiting concord in DP or NP, as illustrated in (3.3) and (3.4).

3.1.6 Sufﬁxes obscured by phonological modiﬁcations
In order to take into proper account the effects of phonological deletions, there are
cases in which a morph is analysed as being underlyingly present even though it fails

Here the every use of μpl-μsame occurs after μassoc which I interpret as derivational, and not a
realization of the inﬂectional feature case:associative. The use of μassoc to derive nominals meaning
‘places with X’, and the reference to many such places by use of μpl-μsame, is common in my corpus,
accounting for around one quarter of the instances of μpl-μsame.
3.1 Sufﬁxes 47
to appear in the surface form of some words. In all such cases, the reasoning behind
the analysis is that in morphologically comparable forms, the morph in question can
be identiﬁed as present at the underlying phonological level, and that phonological
modiﬁcations for which there is independent evidence are expected to cause the
deletion of the morph at the surface. One sufﬁx which is often deleted at the surface is
the μloc, realized underlyingly as /ki/. The μloc is always preceded by an ‘excep-
tional’ phonological juncture and hence its initial /k/ is often deleted. This can leave
the /i/ adjacent to a preceding vowel in which case it can also be deleted. A range of
scenarios is presented in (3.5). The underlying /k/ survives only after a nasal (3.5a–c)
and is palatalized to /c/ after /ɲ/ (3.5b). Otherwise the /k/ does not surface (3.5d–f).
When /k/ deletes the remaining /i/ becomes /j/ between two vowels (3.5e) and deletes
entirely in the environment /V__C (3.5f).

3.2 Stems and stem–sufﬁx dependencies
3.2.1 Personal pronominal stems
There are three series of personal pronominal stems in Kayardild, referred to here as
basic, possessive, and sejunct. In each series there is a contrast between ﬁrst, second,
and third person; and singular, dual, and plural number. In the dual and plural of
the basic and possessive series a contrast exists between exclusive (i.e. 1-d, 1-p) and
inclusive (1-2-d, 1-2-p). Non-singular number categories are marked overtly by /r ~ ra
~ ru/ (dual) or /l ~ la ~ lu/ (plural). A special non-singular inclusive form exists solely
48 Speciﬁc stems and sufﬁxes
in the possessive series. For each person category in each series, the singular root
differs from a common, non-singular root. In the ﬁrst and second person the singular
root also differs between the basic series on the one hand and the possessive and
sejunct series on the other. Person/number roots are summarized in Table 3.6.
The basic series is used as the stem when the word is associated either with no
inﬂectional features or solely with the +comp feature. The sejunct series (correspond-
ing to Evans’ (1995a) ‘subject oblique’ series) is used when solely +sej is associated with
the word. The possessive series is used in all other inﬂectional contexts, and also serves
as the possessive stem and as the pronominal stem used in compounds (cf }3.2.6).
Stems are shown in Table 3.7 and their analysis into constituent morphs in Table 3.8.
The morphomic possessive and sejunct morphs (μposs, μsej) /paɲ/, /pa/ are preceded
by an ‘exceptional’ juncture, hence underlying /p/ often surfaces as [w]; the initial /i/ of
μiny /iɲ/ forces the deletion of a preceding, underlying /u/ vowel.

3.2 Stems and stem–sufﬁx dependencies 49
3.2.2 Irregular sufﬁxed forms of stems
Three lexical stems have partially idiosyncratic sufﬁxed forms, as documented by
Evans (1995a:129, 367, 642) and shown in Table 3.9. In the ﬁrst two cases, the
idiosyncratic form is in variation with a regular form.10
In all three cases, the idiosyncratic sufﬁxed forms differ in only small respects
from the (attested or unattested) regular form. In terms of a formal analysis, one
could posit phonological modiﬁcations speciﬁc to the word forms which cause
them to deviate from regular forms, or posit idiosyncratic allomorphs such as:
/kari/ for μpriv which would attach to the regular stem /wuɻan/ in wurankarri;
an irregular, cumulative stem+μprop form /palmpuu/ for balmbuu;11
and an irregu-
lar stem /ŋaː/ or /ŋaːk/ to which the regular μgen sufﬁx /karaɲ/ would attach in
ngaakarra.
The root mawurraji- /mauraci-/ ‘ﬁghting spear’ has an optional form mawurrajin-
when uninﬂected, which when followed by the regular allomorph of t yields /maur-
acinta/. In an inﬂected word only the root /mauraci-/ is used.

The form wurankarri- has an idiosyncratic meaning ‘hungry’, though I have also heard it used
with the productive meaning ‘food-less’, used in reference to a bush with no fruit.
11
According phonological principles found elsewhere in Kayardild there is no way to attach an
irregular sufﬁx to the regular stem /palmpi/, or to attach regular μprop /kuu/ to an irregular stem, to
yield /palmpuu/ and so a cumulative, irregular form would need to be listed whole.
50 Speciﬁc stems and sufﬁxes
3.2.3 Irregular μpl-t
The morphomic plural (μpl) is realized solely as /palat̪/ except at the end of a word.
At the end of a word there are two possibilities in free variation. In the ﬁrst, μpl is
realized as /palat̪/ followed by the phonologically regular /-ta/ allomorph of t. In the
second, the string μpl-t is realized as /palaː/. One analysis of the latter is that μpl has
an allomorph /pala/ before t, which idiosyncratically selects the /-a/ allomorph of t.
This would accord with the historical picture, where μpl descends from an erstwhile
particle /walat̪/ ~ /wala/ (Round 2011c)12
which would have selected phonologically
regular allomorphs /-ta/ and /-a/ for t. An alternative synchronic analysis is that
/palaː/ is the cumulative realization of μpl and t. I am not aware of any synchronic
grounds for preferring one analysis over the other.
3.2.4 The increment
Nominal roots with the shape /CV/ are rare in Kayardild. There are three with the
shape /Ca/. When uninﬂected each of these is optionally followed by a morphomic
increment (inc) realized phonologically as /ɻ/ and which in turn idiosyncratically
selects the /-a/ allomorph of t. This is shown in Table 3.10, which also compares the

cf Lardil wala ‘and then’, walac-i ‘in addition’. The change from initial /w/ to /p/ is motivated by the
innovation of an ‘exceptional’ juncture before the newly grammaticalized sufﬁx—note that the initial /p/ of
μpl still often surfaces as [w] in modern Kayardild.
3.2 Stems and stem–sufﬁx dependencies 51
incremented roots with a true /Caɻ/ stem, which selects the regular, phonologically
determined allomorphy of t.13
Senior speakers in my corpus use only the unincremented root in inﬂected forms
or in compounds as in (3.7a,b), whereas younger speakers use the incremented form
as an alternative to the basic root even in inﬂected and derived forms, as in (3.7c). The
increment does arguably appear in the derivational locative stem /ɻaɻi-/ of the ‘south’
root /ɻa/, on which see }3.2.5.

Evans (1995a:124) characterizes individual speakers as using either exclusively the unincremented or
the incremented forms. The relevant data I have are scanty, but one speaker is recorded using both
unincremented /ca-a/ ‘foot-t’ and incremented /ɻa-ɻ-a/ ‘south-inc-t’.
52 Speciﬁc stems and sufﬁxes
There is one /Cu/ root, ru- /ɻu/ ‘fat’ which also takes the increment,14
though relevant
data are limited. When uninﬂected the root has only ever been attested as incremen-
ted /ɻu-ɻ-a/, never */ɻuː/ or */ɻu-a/, as shown in Table 3.11 where incremented /ɻu/ is
contrasted with a true /Cuɻ/ stem such as /ʈuɻ/ ‘faeces’.
All attested inﬂected forms of /ɻu/ were uttered by senior speakers and are shown
in (3.8). Compared to /Ca/ roots the increment is used in more contexts with /ɻu/ but
with so few forms it is not possible to make any reliable further generalizations. Roots
of the shape /Ci/ are never followed by the increment.

A single polysyllabic root in Kayardild can also be analysed as taking an increment.
The uninﬂected form of jingkara ‘scrub’ is shown in Table 3.12 alongside the
uninﬂected form of a true polysyllabic /ɻ/-ﬁnal root.
All inﬂected forms of jingkara are built on the incremented root /ciŋka-ɻ/.

Another root, duu- ‘anus’ is presumably underlyingly /ʈuu/. It does not occur with inc when
uninﬂected (i.e. one does not ﬁnd */ʈuɻa/). I have no information on its inﬂection (my consultants politely
avoided using the word when I asked about it), but it appears in one compound recorded by Evans, with a
long (or double) vowel: duungambungambu /ʈuu-ŋampu-ŋampu-/ ‘ﬂatulent, lit. anus-well-well’.

3.2.5 Compass locational stems
Like many Australian languages Kayardild possesses a rich set of derived stems based on
roots denoting the four cardinal compass points. For a comprehensive discussion of
their usage see Evans (1995a:206–27). Tables 3.13–3.17 present analyses of the stems’
morphological constituency. Many stems contain allomorphy which is old, in some

cases tracing back to proto Tangkic. Our concern here will be with the synchronic
system and accordingly forms are analysed in terms of roots and sufﬁxes which are
regular across several forms, and phonological modiﬁcations attested elsewhere in the
language.
Table 3.13 sets out the four cardinal roots and what we may term ﬁrst order derived
stems. First order stems will each serve as the base of several other second order stems.
Stems in the table are presented ﬁrst as phonological wholes, then divided into com-
ponent morphs and internal junctures, then accompanied by a morphomic gloss.
Table 3.14 lists additional stems based directly on cardinal roots.
Table 3.15 shows second order stems based on the allative stem. The ‘facing’ forms
illustrate a whole family of compounds comprised of the allative stem plus a body part,
meaning ‘having one’s body-part facing N/S/E/W’. Attested body parts used in such
compounds are bardaka- /paʈaka-/ ‘belly’, kirrk- /kirk/ ‘nose’, kurndung- /kuɳtuŋ/
‘chest’, mibur- /mipuɻ/ ‘eye’, thukan- /t̪ukan-/ ‘beard’, and wara- /waɻa/ ‘beak’.

3.2.6 Sufﬁxation of compound stems and argument structure
Some sufﬁxes attach to bases containing multiple roots. When functioning as a
derivational nominalizer, the morphomic nominalizer (μn) freely attaches to a
nominal stem + verbal stem complex (3.10), to a nominal stem + reduplicated verbal
stem (3.11), or to nominal + nominal + verbal stems as in (3.12).

The nominal stem component of compound stems in these constructions can also be
represented by pronominal stems. Pronominal stems plus verb stems appear in plain

The word forms in (3.10)–(3.15) are all derivational nominalizations of verbal stems,
compounded with nominal stems whose semantic function is to contribute argu-
ments (or adjuncts) for the event type denoted by the verb stem.16
It is of interest to
note that the morphomic privative, proprietive, and associative sufﬁxes (μpriv,
μprop, μassoc) also attach to compound stems in which nominal components
contribute argument-like semantics pertaining to stative event types, even though
stems in these instances lack a verbal component, consisting instead of nominal1 +
nominal2. The complete word forms have the meanings ‘(not) having nominal2 at
nominal1’ as shown in (3.16), with the argument-like nature of the nominals
evidently projected from the semantics of the (non-verbal) derivational markers.
This fact will be relevant in }9.2.3 when we review the claim that certain inﬂectional
sufﬁxes should be analysed as verbalizers in part because they appear to have an
argument structure.

3.2.7 Lack of case:genitive inﬂection of pronominal stems
In the two languages most closely related to Kayardild, the genitive case inﬂection of
pronominal stems contains the usual, possessive stem followed by the morphomic
genitive ligative (μgenl) sufﬁx and the morphomic genitive proper (μgen). An

In Kayardild I have just three recorded instances of DPs in which one would expect, all

manner. What is actually found appears to be a single word composed of a compounded
pronominal stem and kin term. All three examples are uttered by the same speaker and

3.3 Song forms and their place in Kayardild grammar
Kayardild has not been documented as possessing any special spoken registers in
which the phonology, morphology, or syntax departs from normal everyday speech.
However, the morphology of Kayardild song is distinctive. From a diachronic
perspective it is archaic.17
There are two points on which the morphology of Kayardild song departs from the
morphology of the spoken register. The ﬁrst departure relates to the morphomic
allative (μall) which in spoken Kayardild has just one allomorph /ɻiŋ/ but in song
has /ɻuŋ/ in addition (the latter form is etymologically prior, cf Yukulta /ɭuŋ/). The
second departure pertains to the allomorphy of μprop, μabl, and μcons, introduced
in }2.5 above. As mentioned, song permits only the use of strong allomorphs,
never weak. This is illustrated in the case of μprop which realizes the feature value
tama:future, in (3.21) and (3.22).

Although song permits only strong allomorphs, this is not to say that song forms
always merely neutralize a strong/weak distinction found in the spoken register. A case
in point is μcons, which has a weak allomorph /ŋara/ and strong allomorph /ŋarpa/.
In the spoken register the weak (and never the strong) allomorph of μcons realizes
tamt:past, as shown in (3.23a), while the strong (and never the weak) allomorph
realizes tamt:precondition and case:consequential, as in (3.23b,c). In song, although
I have identiﬁed only a handful of instances of tamt:past, they are all realized by the
strong (and not the weak) allomorph of μcons as illustrated in (3.24).

Signiﬁcantly, it is only in the comparison of the two registers that we ﬁnd the
evidence that /ŋarpa/ and /ŋara/ are related as strong–weak allomorphs, since in
neither register taken on its own is there is a morphosyntactic feature value which is
realized by both /ŋarpa/ and /ŋara/. Since it appears that all adults in traditional
Kayardild society both composed and sang songs and thus had mastery over both the
spoken and sung registers, and since the morphological system in both registers is so
similar, it is reasonable to assume that speakers possessed a single grammar which
underlay all forms. Accordingly, when analysing Kayardild morphology, evidence is
considered from both registers. The correct derivation of register-appropriate forms
is included in the formal account Kayardild’s realizational morphology in Chapter 11.
3.4 The termination
3.4.1 The termination is not a nominative case marker
In the analysis proposed in this book, all Kayardild words end at the morphomic level
of representation with a meaningless morphome t, the termination. The termination
is posited in order to account for a set of phenomena all related to the right edge of
the Kayardild word. Some of these are treated by Evans (1995a) in terms of a
‘nominative’ sufﬁx and some in terms of special, word-ﬁnal allomorphs of mor-
phemes. Here I provide an argument for why t is not a nominative morpheme and
why the ﬁnal /a/ vowel of certain verb forms is better analysed as t than as a tamt
inﬂection.
Let us refer to an analysis of Kayardild which invokes a nominative (nom) sufﬁx
rather than t as one which adopts a ‘nominative (nom) hypothesis’. The nominative
hypothesis gains initial plausibility from a set of observations listed in Table 3.18.
A key fact here is that the phonological realization of t is zero if it follows a double
vowel /aa/ or /uu/, or an /a/ vowel after a stem of more than two morae.
The ﬁrst observation (Table 3.18(a)) is that all verbal words are minimally three
morae in length and since most end in /a/ or /uu/ they do not end in any overt
exponent of t. The nominative hypothesis supposes that nom is simply not present
at the end of these words. Of course this makes sense given that they are verbs.
The second observation (Table 3.18(b)) is that most (non-nominative) case marked
nominal words also end in /a/ or /uu/, and so also do not end in any overt exponent
3.4 The termination 61
of t, and so the nominative hypothesis supposes that nom is not present there either.
The ﬁnal observation (Table 3.18(c,d)) is that overt t appears on two classes of
nominals: those which are otherwise case-less, and which are taken to be inﬂected
for nom, and those which are inﬂected with the set of ‘adnominal’ case values, which
are then taken to be inﬂected for ‘adnominal case’ plus nom (Evans 1995a:136–7). The
nom hypothesis then is that the nom sufﬁx is a morphologically meaningful sufﬁx
whose distribution is governed by morphological categories. However a closer
examination of the facts shows that the true generalizations are phonological.
First we can note that the ‘adnominal case’ sufﬁxes often end in consonants or the
short high vowel /i/ or /u/. Examples are the origin case realized phonologcially (via
μorig) by /waːɲ/, the privative case realized phonologcially (via μpriv) by /wari/
and associative case realized phonologically (via μassoc) by /ɳuru/. These all
require an overt realization of t after them on phonological grounds (though once
ﬁnal /i/ and /u/ are followed by /a/, the resulting strings /ia/ and /ua/ often reduce
phonetically to [i] and [u]). When we take a second look at the few other inﬂectional
sufﬁxes in Kayardild which also end in /i/ or /u/ we ﬁnd that they too are followed by
overt /a/. (No other inﬂectional sufﬁxes end in consonants.)
What I have analysed in this book as the morphomic locative (μloc) is usually
the ‘locative case’ in Evans’ (1995a) system, a sufﬁx which functions as the (relational)
locative case, the modal locative, and complementizing locative cases, none of which
are adnominal cases. The phonological realization of μloc is /ki/ which ends in /i/
and so is followed regularly by t /a/ at the end of a word, as in (3.25a). On Evans’
analysis that /a/ vowel is not nom, but rather part of an allomorph of μloc which
ends in /ia/, as shown for example in (3.25b).

62 Speciﬁc stems and sufﬁxes
By positing this allomorphy in the locative case marker, the extra /a/ in (3.25) is
accounted for, though on that analysis it remains accidental that the allomorphy
involves the same phonological content as a nom sufﬁx.
The difﬁculty for the nom hypothesis comes from the fact, not documented
in Evans (1995a) that all other /i/ and /u/ ﬁnal inﬂectional sufﬁxes also get followed
by /a/ (with the usual optional reduction of /ia/ and /ua/ to [i] and [u]). This includes
Evans’ immediate tense, realized (via μloc) by /ki/, the negative actual tense, realized
(via μpriv) by /wari/, the (non-adnominal) instrumental case realized (via μinst) by
/ŋuni/ and the potential tense and (non-adnominal) modal proprietive case realized
occasionally (via μprop) by /kuɻu/. All of these are followed by /a/ which, if phonetic
reduction doesn’t apply, appears in the surface phonetic form. In order to maintain
the nom hypothesis, all of these sufﬁxes would require an extra allomorph which
differed from the existing allomorph only by the addition of /a/. The consequence is
an undermining of the original claim that the distribution of nom is governed by
morphological factors, since now, in all cases where nom does not appear according
to those morphological factors (which were closely correlated with phonology to
begin with), we require allomorphy whose content reproduces precisely what the
phonologically conditioned form of nom would have been, had it appeared. It is
simpler to dispense with the morphologically meaningful nom sufﬁx and recognize
instead the presence of a formal element with no meaning, and whose realization is
determined by the phonology of its base.
3.4.2 tamt:actual, tamt:imperative, and t
Verbs which take the actual and imperative value of the thematic tense/aspect/mood
(tamt) feature end in the phonological realization /t̪/ or /c/ of a thematic (th or j)
followed by /a/. Round (2009:161–3) argues that the /a/ in this case is not inserted by

phonological epenthesis, but this leaves the question of whether the ﬁnal /a/ is atamt
sufﬁx, or a realization of t. The evidence is not overwhelming but does suggest that
the /a/ is a realization of t.
Most tamt values are realized identically in the absence of +neg and when they
co-occur with +neg, as shown in Table 3.19.
This is not the case for tamt:actual or tamt:imperative. When tamt:imperative
co-occurs with +neg only a μneg morphome appears, as shown in Table 3.20. When
tamt:actual co-occurs with +neg only the μpriv morphome appears. When either
occur without +neg a ﬁnal /a/ vowel appears which could be taken as a realization of
tamt or just as t.
Going by the facts (i) that regular, non-cumulative markers of tamt features
usually do appear in negative verbs; (ii) that this is not the case for tamt:imperative
and tamt:actual; (iii) that the forms of non-negative tamt:imperative and tamt:
actual verbs can be accounted for in terms of t; and (iv) that imperative and default-
like tenses such as actual are often zero-marked cross-linguistically, the analysis
adopted here will be that the ﬁnal /a/ of non-negative imperative and actual tamt
verb forms is t.

Correlates of inﬂection
When a Kayardild word appears in a syntactic setting it appears in an appropriately
inﬂected form. Since a word’s syntactic environment partly determines its form, it
makes sense to speak of a transfer of information between the syntactic and the
morphological components of the Kayardild grammar. The remainder of this book
will be concerned with the morphological and syntactic correlates of that transfer and
will progressively adduce a formal account of the inﬂectional system. For the
purposes of formalization, it will be assumed that a morphosyntactic representation
is calculated for each word in a sentence. This provides all of the information
required by the realizational morphology for spelling out an appropriately inﬂected
form of the word, in a manner which can then be interpreted by the phonology.
The current chapter provides a preliminary orientiation to the issues which will be
involved in the analysis of Kayardild inﬂection. Chapters 5–8 then examine various
aspects of Kayardild syntax and its relationship to the morphology, and Chapter 9
addresses some overarching issues which arise. Chapter 11 presents a formal,
constraint-based implementation of the analysis. Here we examine inﬂectional
features in }4.1, morphological realization in }4.2, feature co-occurence restrictions
in }4.3, concord in }4.4, and non-surface syntactic structures and their evidential
bases in }4.5.
4.1 Inﬂectional features and their values
Kayardild inﬂection will be analysed here in terms of seven distinct morphosyntactic
features. All seven will be treated as privative, which is to say that words may be
positively speciﬁed for them or may be entirely unspeciﬁed for them. Four of the
features are also multivalued, so that a positive speciﬁcation for the feature entails a
speciﬁcation for one of several permissible values of that feature. Notational conven-
tions which will be used are: (i) F:Ø to indicate that a word is unspeciﬁed for feature F;
(ii) +F to indicate that a word is positively speciﬁed for feature F; and (iii) F:v to
indicate that a word is speciﬁed for value v of feature F. The seven features are as
follows, each discussed in turn:
 case
 number
 thematic tense/aspect/mood/polarity/diathesis: TAMT
 athematic tense/aspect/mood/polarity: TAMA
 negation
 complementization
 sejunct
4.1.1 Case
CASE takes any one of the twenty-four values shown in Tables 4.1 and 4.2. The
morphosyntactic feature CASE indexes several distinct kinds of syntactic relationship:
between DPs and their dominating clause or verb, between a DP and another DP that

it modiﬁes, and between a predicate DP and its subject. A morphological distinction
can be made between ‘thematic’ and ‘athematic’ case values, the signiﬁcance of which
is discussed in }4.3.2. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 provide a brief characterization of the main
semantic and grammatical functions of the CASE values. The reader is referred to
pages of Evans (1995a) for more detailed descriptions and examples; see also Appen-
dix A for equivalences between Evans’ analysis and the features employed here.
Most values of Kayardild CASE are semantically rich, and the thematic values in
particular have narrow and specialized meanings mostly pertaining to events of
movement and transfer. What brings these disparate functions together as values
of a single morphosyntactic feature is that they are all in paradigmatic opposition
with one another; they share the same kinds of potential distribution across the
words in a sentence and they associate with the same kinds of syntactic nodes,
namely DPs. These facts are explored further in later chapters.

4.1 Inﬂectional features and their values 67
4.1.2 Number
NUMBER, abrreviated NUM, can take one of the two positively speciﬁed values shown in
Table 4.3. Most often though NUMBER is left unspeciﬁed, as NUMBER:—this does not
signal ‘singular’, rather that the speaker has chosen not to provide any information.
4.1.3 Thematic tense/aspect/mood/polarity/diathesis: TAMT
Abbreviated TAMT, this feature takes any one of the fourteen values shown in Table 4.4
and signals tense, aspect, and mood, and in some cases polarity and diathesis.
The semantic and grammatical functions of TAMT in Kayardild are, if anything,
even richer and more disparate than CASE. Nevertheless, this set of values comprises a
coherent class in terms of how and where it is realized and distributed in the clause.
This in itself is interesting: the Kayardild inﬂectional system is tremendously compli-
cated but it is highly organized. Disparate semantic functions are channelled into just
a few distinct features whose regularities are shared. The analysis to be developed
here attempts to express precisely these regularities of organization in a maximally
perspicuous, informative, and elegant manner.
4.1.4 Athematic tense/aspect/mood/polarity: TAMA
ATHEMATIC TENSE/ASPECT/MOOD, abbreviated TAMA, takes one of the eleven values listed
in Table 4.5. Like TAMT, it signals tense, aspect, mood, and some polarity.
4.1.5 Negation
NEGATION, abbreviated NEG, is a unary feature conveying clause-level negation.
4.1.6 Complementization
Clauses in Kayardild may be complementized in which case their constituents may
bear overt marking for the unary morphosyntactic feature COMPLEMENTIZATION, abbre-
viated COMP. Clauses are complementized under a variety of conditions mostly
connected to discourse level and cross-clausal factors (see Evans 1995a:488–529).

Complementized clauses also come in two types, which I will refer to as sejunct

clauses may bear overt inﬂection for the unary morphosyntactic feature SEJUNCT,
abbreviated SEJ.

4.2 Morphological realization
Chapter 2 introduced the complex relationships that can hold between morpho-
logical form and function in Kayardild, including the roles of an intermediate,
morphomic level of representation, phonological juncture types, allomorphy, cumu-
lative realization, and compound sufﬁxes. All of these phenomena ﬁgure in the
realization of Kayardild’s inﬂectional features. Selected examples follow and a com-
plete formal implementation of Kayardild’s realizational morphology is provided in
Chapter 11.
Many inﬂectional feature values share their realization with others. To take one
example, CASE:locative, TAMA:instantiated, TAMA:present, TAMT:immediate and +COMP
are all realized by the primary morphome μLOC. In the examples shown in (4.1a–d),
μLOC is in turn realized phonologically as /+ki/.

CASE:privative is realized by the primary morphome μPRIV, and μPRIV also serves as the
cumulative exponent of {+NEG, TAMT:actual}. More speciﬁcally though, CASE:privative
is realized as μPRIV with a ‘regular’ juncture type, indicated in the phonological gloss
line by ‘-’, while {+NEG, TAMT:actual} is realized as μPRIV with an ‘exceptional’ juncture
indicated by ‘+’ as shown in (4.2a,b). The choice of phonological juncture determines
whether the underlying cluster /t̪w/ surfaces as the glide [j] or the plosive [t̪].

As mentioned in Chapter 2, inﬂectional and derivational sufﬁxes are often identical
in form. In the pairs (4.3a,b) and (4.3c,d) a single sufﬁx realizes inﬂectional feature
values in the ﬁrst word but is derivational in the second.

Turning to allomorphy, CASE:proprietive and TAMA:future in (4.4) are both realized by
μPROP, but differ in terms of their allomorphy feature: CASE:proprietive in (4.4a) is
4.2 Morphological realization 71
realized as μPROP which passes one allomorph (the strong allomorph) to the phon-
ology, while TAMA:future in (4.4b) is realized as μPROP which passes both allomorphs.
Consequently in (4.4a) the strong allomorph /kuɻu/ appears as the ultimate realiza-
tion of CASE:proprietive while in (4.4.b) the phonology has selected the weak allo-
morph /kuu/ for TAMA:future.

4.3 Feature co-occurrence
4.3.1 Antagonistic feature values and the suppression of realization
An analytic move which will contribute signiﬁcantly to a coherent account of
Kayardild morphosyntax is the recognition that certain pairs of morphosyntactic
feature values are antagonistic, in the sense that the realization of one will preclude
or suppress the realization of another. This means that although some words may
be associated with two feature values F:v and G:w, only one of those two features will
be overtly realized. A complete list of pairs of antagonistic feature values, and
antagonistic features is given in Table 4.6.
In the case of +SEJ and +COMP the former feature value is always realized at the
expense of the latter if the two co-occur; it is marked as prioritized in Table 4.6. In

72 Correlates of inﬂection
other cases, the question of which feature value gets realized is resolved by contextual
factors.
The motivation for positing antagonistic pairs of feature values is twofold. First, an
antagonistic relationship expresses a generalization in the morphology of Kayardild
which is not necessarily expected otherwise, namely that certain combinations of
feature values are simply never realized together on a single word. Secondly, and
more importantly, the positing of antagonistic relationships in the Kayardild gram-
mar allows us to recognize that some words may be associated with certain feature
values F:v, even though F:v receives no overt realization on that word, due to the
co-presence of a certain other feature value G:w. When formalizing principles
of morphological realization the recognition of antagonistic, or ‘disjunctive’, or
‘blocking’ relationships between morphosyntactic features has a long history in
morphological theory (Anderson 1986) and as we will see it permits powerful
generalizations to be made regarding the syntactic distribution of feature values
within the Kayardild sentence.
4.3.2 A twin, antagonistic system of tense–aspect–mood (TAM) inﬂection
Kayardild possesses a twin, and antagonistic, system of tense–aspect–mood–polarity
(TAM) inﬂection. That is to say, the TAM semantics of a Kayardild clause is inﬂection-
ally marked in two different ways, though only one kind of marking may appear on
any given word. The analysis of these facts will be that each clause in Kayardild is
associated with a single value of TAMT (the ‘thematic’ TAM feature), a single value of
TAMA (the ‘athematic’ feature), and a value of NEGATION. Let us refer to the set of TAM
features {TAMT, TAMA, NEG} corresponding to given clause C, as TC, so that the set TC
contains an exhaustive representation of the morphosyntactically relevant TAM
semantics of clause C. Now, the feature TAMA stands in an antagonistic relationship
to both TAMT and NEG (cf }4.3.1) and thus of the three features in TC, for any given
word either (i) only TAMT and NEGATION will be realized; or (ii) only TAMA will be
realized; or (iii) none of the three may be realized; but it is impossible for all three to
be realized on the same word.1
Some words in a sentence inﬂect for none of the features in TC and the complex
issue of whether or not a given word will inﬂect for features in TC is discussed
in detail in Chapter 5. For the moment it will sufﬁce to observe that most words
within the verb phrase (VP) do inﬂect for features in TC while words outside the VP
never do.
As stated, some words inﬂect for TAMT/NEG, and others for TAMA. Which of these
two possibilities obtains follows straightforwardly from the morphomic composition
1
As we will see in }5.3, it is possible for additional mixes of features to be realized once we examine
words within embedded clauses; however the restrictions on features which are associated with one and the
same clause will always hold.
4.3 Feature co-occurrence 73
of the stem to which a TAM sufﬁx attaches, as summarized in Table 4.7. Stems that end
in a thematic element (TH or J) inﬂect for the thematic feature TAMT and for NEG, while
stems that end in anything else inﬂect for the athematic feature TAMA.
Entering into this equation is the fact that (i) all lexical verbal stems end morpho-
mically in a thematic; (ii) all lexical nominal stems do not; but that (iii) the thematic
CASE sufﬁxes also end with a thematic, as do the realizations of TAMA:incipient and
TAMT:incipient. This means that bare verbal stems, and all stems ending in thematic
CASE sufﬁxes will inﬂect alike for the TAM features in TC (the situation with words
in incipient clauses is more complicated due to the clausal embedding involved; see
}5.4.1).
The division of the majority of VP-internal words into two groups—one inﬂecting
for one kind of TAM information, and one inﬂecting for another kind—pervades the
grammar of Kayardild. A way in which the present analysis offers a simpler account
than Evans (1995a) is that here, those two kinds of overtly marked TAM information
always correspond to the features TAMT/NEG on the one hand and TAMA on the other.
In Evans (1995a) every clause contains two groups of VP-internal words that inﬂect
for different kinds of TAM information, but the features involved range across any one
of four combinations involving six features or feature-like operations. The use of
such a large number of features in Evans (1995a) obscures the generalization, that a
single set of principles underlies TAM marking in all Kayardild clause types. Compari-
sons between the proposals are found in }9.2.
4.3.3 Restrictions on paired values of TAMT and TAMA
Separate from the question of which features are overtly realized, there exist restric-
tions on which TAM features values may be associated with one and the same clause.
The features TAMT and TAMA both encode information about TAM semantics, but
their values do not correspond to one another in a one-to-one fashion (indeed if they
did then TAMT and TAMA could be collapsed into a single feature). Instead, the two
features exhibit a limited degree of indepedent variation (Evans 1995a, 1995b). Let us
refer to the values of TAMT and TAMA which are elements of the same set TC (i.e. which

associate with the same clause) as being paired. The co-occurrence restrictions that
exist on paired TAMT and TAMA values interact with two further syntactic factors:
whether a clause is complementized (cf }5.1), and whether or not the clause is a
subordinate, embedded VP constituent (cf }5.3). Table 4.8 lists the attested, paired
values of TAMA and TAMT in uncomplementized full clauses, complementized full

4.4 Concord
Undoubtedly the most central and striking attribute of Kayardild inﬂection is the
phenomenon which I will term concord.2
Concord is deﬁned in (4.6) and a simple
example follows in (4.7).
(4.6) Concord
The morphological realization, on multiple words dominated by a syntactic
node n, of a morphosyntactic feature value associated with n.
The example in (4.7) shows a DP, ending with thungalu ‘thing’ and associated with
CASE:proprietive, which in turn contains an embedded DP ending with dangka-
nabawu ‘man’ and associated with CASE:ablative.
(4.7) [DP[DP balarrinabawu dangkanabawu ABL] thungalu PROP]

white-‹ABL›-PROP man-‹ABL›-PROP thing-PROP
‘having a white man’s thing (i.e. a tape recorder)’ [R2005-jul21]
All three words in (4.7) are dominated by the matrix DP node, and all three inﬂect for
CASE:proprietive; words within the subordinate DP are dominated by both the matrix
and the subordinate nodes and are inﬂected for both CASE:ablative and CASE:proprie-
tive. What (4.7) illustrates is in fact a particular kind of concord which I will term
transparent concord, deﬁned in (4.8).
(4.8) Transparent concord
The overt morphological realization, on all words dominated by a syntactic
node n, of a morphosyntactic feature value associated with n.
In describing Kayardild it will be useful to contrast transparent concord with condi-
tioned concord deﬁned in (4.9).
2
‘Concord’ in this sense has been used by Klokeid (1976) with respect to Lardil, Dench and Evans (1988)
with respect to case marking in Australian languages in general, Evans (1995a) with respect to Kayardild,
and Plank (1995) with respect to Sufﬁxaufnahme in general. See also Evans (2003) for a comparative-
theoretical discussion of his analysis of Kayardild in relation to notions of concord, agreement, and
government.
76 Correlates of inﬂection
(4.9) Conditioned concord
The morphological realization of a morphosyntactic feature value F:v, associ-
ated with a syntactic node n, on all words which (i) are dominated by a
syntactic node n and (ii) are morphologically capable of inﬂecting for F:v.
A more involved example of concord is shown in (4.10).

SEJUNCT feature associated with the clause. The +SEJ feature exhibits transparent
concord within the clause. The verb phrase (VP) within that same clause is associated
with TAMT:past and TAMA:prior. Both these feature values exhibit conditioned con-
cord—TAMT:past is marked on all stems in VP which end with a thematic, and TAMA:
prior is marked on all stems in VP which do not. The sentence ends with the
embedded DP structure ‘[DP[DP brother’s GEN] net INST]’ in which the CASE features
of both DPs exhibit transparent concord. As a result of all this the most embedded
word of all, thabujukarranguninaatha ‘brother’, is marked for its own CASE:genitive,
for CASE:instrumental, for TAMA:prior and for +SEJ.3
Example (4.10) offers a good illustration of the inﬂectional complexity of individ-
ual words that can arise due to concord, but it does not on its own provide much of
an indication of the complexities which exist within the Kayardild system of concord
3
Strictly speaking, to be consistent with the analysis built up in following chapters: the clause marked S00
in (4.10) is also associated with a +CMP feature which exhibits the limiting case of conditioned concord: it is
associated with each word in the clause but in every instance is blocked from being realized by the presence
of +SEJ. In addition the TAMT:prior feature associates with an S node rather than VP per se. These issues are
covered in Chapter 5.
4.4 Concord 77
itself. Chapters 5–9 are devoted to an examination of those complexities, and their
analysis.
4.5 Surface syntax, non-surface syntax, and concord
We proceed now to an initial introduction to the issues relating to Kayardild syntax
and the approaches to them which will be expanded on in Chapters 5–9.
4.5.1 Kayardild syntax, brieﬂy
The main predicate of a Kayardild clause is either a single verb, or a set of verbs with
non-contradictory argument structures, or a predicate DP. A verb of transfer or
movement may be elided if its meaning is recoverable from context. Verbs can take
up to two syntactic complement DPs and they may subcategorize for various non-
complement arguments. The complement DPs can be promoted to subject in passive
clauses and can be syntactically topicalized. They can also be syntactically focalized,
as can the subject DP. Word order within DPs is ﬁxed, but the order of verbs and DPs
within the clause is free, to the extent that any order is possible even if not equally
likely or appropriate in all contexts. The word order of particles is more constrained
and is deﬁned in terms of the edges of other surface-syntactic constituents. DPs are
freely elided when their reference is recoverable from context. It is not uncommon
for multiple, identically inﬂected DPs to be juxtaposed in a single clause. DP
juxtaposition has several functions including apposition, conjunction, and disjunc-
tion. An array of embedded structures is attested. DPs can contain embedded DPs or
embedded VPs as modiﬁers, and predicate DPs can take full embedded clauses as
complements. Clauses themselves can contain embedded ‘adverbial’ VP adjuncts and
main verbs can take embedded clause complements.
4.5.2 Non-surface syntax in the account of inﬂection
Because DPs and verbs are freely ordered within the clause there is no constituent in
the clause which is both larger than the DP and consistently contiguous other than
the clause itself. However, the central claim of the remainder of this chapter is this:
morphosyntactic features in Kayardild are always associated with sets of words which
relate to one another in a strict, hierarchically embedded fashion. Discontinuity on
the surface masks an intricately embedded underlying order.
If we refer to the set of words on which a morphosyntactic feature is realized as
that feature’s domain (Dench and Evans 1988), then once the effects of antagonism
(}4.3) have been factored out the domains of features in Kayardild relate to one
another precisely like hierarchically embedded syntactic constituents. Moreover,
these constituents are not random assemblages of words. Despite the fact that
there is no evidence from surface word order for constituents such as VP (Evans
78 Correlates of inﬂection
1995a:120–1, 534) the inﬂectional domains of Kayardild appear distinctly similar to
domains such as VP, S, DP, and NP which can be detected on the basis of word order
in many other languages.
It makes sense then to speak of a ‘non-surface syntactic’ structure in Kayardild,
with respect to which all Kayardild inﬂectional features exhibit either transparent or
conditioned concord within some or other constituent. The relationship between
non-surface syntax and surface syntax appears to be something akin to scrambling,
although apart from particles (Chapter 10) I make no attempt to analyse surface word
order in this study.
4.5.3 Embedded domains
Let us deﬁne the notation D(x) as follows: (i) D(F:v) stands for the domain of a
feature value F:v; (ii) D(F) stands for the domain of all of the values of F (in the case
that they all coincide); and (iii) D(F,G) stands for the domains of all of the values of
feature F and of feature G (in the case that they all coincide). Let the statement D(G) 
D(F) express the fact that all of the constituent types which occur in the domain of F
also occur in the domain of G, but not vice versa. Now it can be observed that the
relationships in Table 4.9 all hold in Kayardild.
4.5.4 Feature attachment and percolation in non-surface syntax
On the account proposed here the embedded domains of Table 4.9 correspond to
embedded, contiguous constituents in non-surface syntax (see }4.5.5 for speciﬁcs). To
account for the distributions of inﬂectional features across the words of a clause, it is
proposed that morphosyntactic feature values each attach to a speciﬁc syntactic node,
and from there percolate downward to all nodes below and eventually to individual
words (details of this mechanism will be set out in Chapter 8). As such, it will be
useful to distinguish between the initial attachment of a feature to a node before
percolation takes place, and the eventual association of a feature with potentially
many nodes and words. Note that under this model if features F and G attach to nodes

nF and nG respectively, and nF is dominated by nG, then it follows that D(G)  D(F).
For reasons which will become clear in }5.3, a special status must be accorded to the
highest node of a clause, S00
. That node presents an opaque barrier across which no
other features can percolate.
4.5.5 Non-surface syntactic structures
I will assume that non-surface syntactic structures conform to the general X-bar
schema shown in Figure 4.1. This analysis is chosen partly in order that the general-
izations made here remain accessible to a wide range of syntactic theories, but also
because the structure provides a good ﬁt with the data.
Something of an exception to the general X-bar structure of Figure 4.1 are the
nodes S and S00
. The sole immediate constituent of S is VP, while S00
acts mostly like
another X0
node.
For two reasons, I do not assume branching to be binary. First, since DP juxtapos-
ition is not uncommon, and since there is no evidence (from inﬂection) of internal
hierarchical structure among juxtaposed DPs, it is appropriate to treat all juxtaposed
DPs as sisters. As a consequence, if a given XP permits one DP daughter then it will
also permit multiple, juxtaposed DP daughters. Second, we will encounter large
classes of clausal adjunct DPs, all of which exhibit identical inﬂectional properties.
Even though these are not necessarily juxtaposed their inﬂectional behaviour is
indistinct from that of true juxtaposed DPs and their analysis in terms of non-surface
syntax will be the same, that is, they will be sisters under a common mother node.
Although some adjuncts will be analysed as sisters, there are other cases where the
inﬂectional evidence calls for a hierarchical analysis. As will we see shortly the non-
surface syntactic structure of Kayardild—posited on the basis of inﬂectional evi-
dence—is at its most intricate at the level of adjuncts, in particular at the level of DP
adjuncts to VP and S-category nodes.

4.5.6 Height of attachment and linear order of realization

one another, inferred from the relative embedding of their domains. In cases where
more than one feature is overtly realized on a given word, the relative syntactic height

of a feature’s attachment generally4
corresponds with the linear order of its morpho-
logical realization: the higher the node of attachment, the farther from the lexical
stem the attaching feature will be realized.
4.5.7 Other approaches to layered clausal structure
Although it is beyond the scope of this book to make more than passing comment,
the layered view of Kayardild clause structure in Figure 4.2 above, which is posited on
the basis of evidence from inﬂection, can be compared with the layered clause
structure which has gained acceptance within Chomksyan generative grammar
over the past two decades. Although the latter is based on quite different empirical
data and theoretical arguments, researchers such as Pollock (1989), Chomsky (1991),
and Cinque (1999) among others have argued that clauses possess a more articulated
hierarchical structure than was assumed in earlier models of generative grammar
(Chomsky 1965, 1986). Although more recent work has predominantly postulated
phrases whose heads have no overt realization, the seminal arguments for splitting
the IP constituent made by Pollock (1989) focused on syntactic consistuents in
English and French whose heads correlate with visible tense and agreement morph-
ology. Those proposals thus share a modicum of commonality with the arguments
I will present for Kayardild, insofar as the layering of clause structure relates in some
way to overtly realized, tense-like morphosyntactic features.5
By the same token
though there are signiﬁcant differences between the model of Kayardild syntax
proposed here and mainstream Chomksyan research into articulated clause
structure.

Layered clause structure has also been invoked in generative accounts of ‘scrambling’ (e.g. Thráinsson
2001), an empirical phenomenon in which DPs are freely rearranged. As noted earlier, DPs in Kayardild
surface syntax also exhibit something akin to this behaviour.
82 Correlates of inﬂection
In Kayardild the features which attach to each of the several nodes in the clause or
in the DP are assumed to do so because from that one structural position they
percolate downwards to many words, sometimes very many words, often spread
across several subordinate XP domains. By way of contrast, the clausal layers of
recent generative theory are typically associated with features that trigger the move-
ment of just one element (whether an X0
head or a higher projection) into some
domain associated with that feature, and thus the interaction between a clausal node
and the rest of the clause is highly circumscribed. Actual morphological agreement
has recently been pursued in relation to a quite different, long-distance ‘Agree’
operation (Chomsky 2000), although even here the focus remains on agreement
between a trigger and one speciﬁc target. In Kayardild, the positing of layered clausal
structure is fundamentally driven by the existence of triggers whose ‘target’ is
everything that its node dominates.
4.5.8 Word classes and phrasal categories
The present analysis of Kayardild distinguishes between just two lexical, morpho-
logical word classes: nominals and verbals. In terms of their morphomic compos-
ition, lexical verbal stems end formally in a thematic, while lexical nominal stems do
not. In terms of syntax, verbal stems provide the base for words which are syntactic-
ally verbal, and nominal stems the base for words which are syntactically nominal. In
addition to these morphologically grounded nominal and verbal superclasses though,
the analysis of Kayardild syntax presented here also recognizes syntactic subclasses.6
To begin with nominals, the words which are built upon nominal lexical stems can
be divided into several syntactic subclasses, members of which can occupy distinct
types of syntactic positions (cf Evans 1995a:236). A primary division can be made
between subclasses which participate in non-surface syntactic structures and which
consequently may become associated with morphosyntactic features and so inﬂect,
and those which do not participate in non-surface syntactic structures and which
6
This correspondence between a small number of morphological classes and a larger number of
syntactic classes is typical of many Australian languages (Blake 1987:2–3). In the present study syntactic
subclasses are posited with the aim of accounting for why certain morphosyntactic features end up
associating with the words they do. In taking this (morpho)syntactically-driven approach, the current
analysis more closely resembles the general approach to Australian languages taken by Blake (1987, 2001),
than by Dixon (1980) who also places semantic properties at the forefront. Nevertheless, I depart from
Blake’s (2001) practice by deﬁning syntactic phrases (DP, AP, etc.) in terms of the syntactic subclasses (D,
A, etc.) of their heads rather than the broader morphological classes (nominal, verbal). In Evans (1995a)
word classes are stated to be ‘based on the sufﬁxing possibilities for each word’ (1995a:84ff). Taken at face
value this resembles the criteria used here for morphological classes. In practice though, semantic
properties play a non-trivial role in distinguishing word classes from one another in Evans (1995a) and
in some cases pre-empt considerations from morphosyntax: some particles in Evans (1995a) inﬂect for TAMA
while others do not, yet they are treated as one word class presumably on the basis of their function;
conjunctions and interjections are similar in their failure to inﬂect, yet they are treated as two classes, and
both are distinguished from non-inﬂecting particles.
4.5 Surface syntax, non-surface syntax, and concord 83
therefore do not inﬂect. In the former group are determiners D, numbers Num,
adjectives A, and nouns N. These all appear in (subconstituents of) determiner
phrases. In the latter group are clitic particles, interjections and ideophones (particles
are discussed in }4.5.9). With respect to interjections and ideophones I assume that
neither of these classes of words participates in syntactic structures and that this is
why they fail to inﬂect.
Words built upon verbal lexical stems fall into two syntactic subtypes: verbs V and
adverbs Adv, both of which always participate in non-surface syntactic structures.
Several nominal and verbal lexemes are able to function, with modiﬁed semantics,
in more than one syntactic subclass. For example, warngiij- functions as D meaning
‘a certain’, as Num meaning ‘one’ and as A meaning ‘common, shared’; kuruluth-
functions as V meaning ‘kill’ and as Adv meaning ‘do intensely’ (Evans 1995a:86, 237).
Because the multiple syntactic subclasses of these words all correspond to a single
morphological superclass though, there is no derivational morphology which signals
a ‘shift’ between one syntactic subclass and the next, rather the exact same lexical
stem is used in each syntactic function. Accordingly, disambiguation of the intended
meaning of such lexemes relies on context, a matter which will play a central role in
arguments for the existence of the DP in Chapter 6.
Corresponding to the syntactic subclasses of Kayardild the following phrasal
categories will be recognized: determiner phrases DP, number phrases NumP,
adjective phrases AP, noun phrases NP, verb phrases VP, and adverb phrases
AdvP. A comparison between the word classes and syntactic phrases used here and
those of Evans (1995a) is provided in Appendix A.
4.5.9 Surface syntax, particles, and particle-like DPs
Although Kayardild word order is notionally ‘free’, strong biases in actual word order
are readily apparent and while the exploration of such matters is beyond the scope of
this study I assume that pragmatic and discourse factors play a key role in determin-
ing or at least restricting surface word order (for recent overviews of research into
pragmatically determined word order in Australian languages see Austin 2001;
Mushin 2005; Baker and Mushin 2008). To mention but one example, it is common
for a sequence of juxtaposed, coreferential DPs referring to a place to begin with a
demonstrative (i.e. deictic) DP, and be followed by a more semantically contentful
DP. Examples appear in (5.15), (6.23), and (7.12). Beyond these general biases in
surface word order, however, it is possible to identify a small number of Kayardild
words whose surface word order is yet more strongly constrained, and which never
inﬂect. The analysis proposed here is that these words constitute the syntactic,
particle subclass of the morphological superclass of nominals; particles do not appear
at all in non-surface syntactic structure, but rather are introduced directly into the
84 Correlates of inﬂection
surface syntax as special clitics7
(Anderson 2005; Zwicky 1977), appearing at the
edges of certain surface-syntactic domains. Because particles are absent from non-
surface syntactic structure, they are not assigned morphosyntactic features and they
do not inﬂect. A discussion of the syntax of particles, which has not previously been
reported in Kayardild, is presented in Chapter 10.
4.5.10 DP constituents with predicative content
There are two kinds of predicative constituents in Kayardild which will be analysed
here as DPs. It is not apparent from casual inspection that these constituents ought to
be treated as DPs, but once a full array of evidence has been considered it seems most
reasonable to conclude that they are. A good example is seen in (4.11).
(4.11) Dathina kunawuna jungarr.
ʈat̪ina kuna+kuna-ø cuŋara-ø
that.T ‹childNL-childNL›-T big-T
that ‹child› big
‘That child is big.’ [W1960]
Here, as in many Kayardild clauses, the main clausal predicate shown in bold is not
verbal but nominal. The question is, is the predicate in (4.11) a full DP, or perhaps an
NP, or just an AP? Likewise we can consider depictive second predicates, which may
be nominal (4.12) or clausal (4.13). Are these simple NPs and VPs, or are they NPs
and VPs embedded within an otherwise empty matrix DP?

While particles are special clitics, they are not phonological clitics. That is, particles in Kayardild
constitute independent words both phonologically and grammatically. See Round (2009:180–83) regarding
Kayardild’s two phonological clitics /=ɳa/ and /=ic/.
4.5 Surface syntax, non-surface syntax, and concord 85
The same question arises regarding the status of adverbial VPs such as the ‘motion
purpose’ clause in (4.14).
(4.14) Balmbu ngada daliju
palmpuu-ø ŋat̪-ta ʈali-c+kuu-ø

2sg-ø-‹DIRA›-FUT ‹talk›-‹DIRT›-FUT
‘Tomorrow I’ll come to talk to you.’ [E453.ex.11-8]
All of these predicate XPs are analysed here as sitting inside a DP constituent.
Evidence for that analysis converges from two independent directions. For one, the
survey of Kayardild morphosyntax in the following chapters will independently yield
evidence for the existence of otherwise-empty DPs whose sole overt material is NP,
AP, and VP. As such, the syntactic structures that are required in order to place
predicate XPs inside a matrix DP are structures that must exist in Kayardild anyhow.
Secondly, once it has been formalized, the mechanism of feature percolation turns
out to treat predicate APs, NPs, and VPs (or, under this analysis, their matrix DP)
exactly like other DPs and exactly unlike other APs, NPs, and VPs. The account of
feature percolation, a central process in the operation of Kayardild inﬂection, is
therefore signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed if we suppose that these predicate XPs are embed-
ded under DP nodes: percolation then needs only to distinguish DP nodes from non-
DP nodes.

Embedded S00
constituents are examined in }5.3 and embedded VPs in }5.4. The lower
reaches of the clause below VPÆ are dealt with in }5.5 and the substantial topic of
tama is covered in }}5.6–5.9.
5.1 Complementization and S-category nodes
Many clauses in Kayardild are complementized. All complementized clauses are
associated with a +comp feature value, and some are also associated with a sejunct
feature +sej. When words in a clause inﬂect for +sej or +comp nearly every nominal
and verbal word in the clause will do so.
Constituents which escape inﬂection for one or both of +comp and +sej are topic
DPs (Evans 1995a: 533–9) covered in }5.1.2, and a newly identiﬁed class of focus DPs
covered in }5.1.3.
To accommodate these facts the uppermost region of the Kayardild clause will be
assumed to contain four hierarchically organized S-category nodes. The feature
values +sej and +comp attach respectively to S0
Æ and S0
. Topic DPs are daughters
of the topmost node S00
, and thus are unable to inherit either +sej or +comp via
feature percolation. Focus DPs are daughters of S0
 and so can inherit +comp but not
+sej. All other constituents of the clause are situated below both S0
nodes and so can
inherit +sej and +comp. Finally, +sej and +comp are antagonistic, meaning that no
word will ever inﬂect for both. A word associated with both +sej and +comp will
inﬂect overtly only for +sej.
5.1.1 Complementized (in)subordinate clauses
Clauses may be complementized if they are subordinate, or if they contain topic or
focus DPs. We begin here with the former. The functions of complementized
subordinate clauses and the conditions which require or permit them to be used
are discussed in Evans (1995a:488–529). Since these are complex and not directly
relevant to present matters they will not be reviewed here, although it should be
noted that complementized subordinate clauses can be ‘insubordinated’ and appear
without their matrix clause. In their (in)subordinate use complementized clauses
regularly exhibit distinctive, overt inﬂection on every nominal and verbal word in the
clause. I will refer to two kinds of complementized clause, sejunct and nonsejunct,
whose traits are summarized in Table 5.1.
Sejunct clauses are the default. Nonsejunct clauses are used when the subject is
either (i) ﬁrst person inclusive, or (ii) second person and ‘the speaker wants to group
88 The clause and VP
him/herself with the addressee’ (Evans 1995a:494). That is to say, there is a disjoint
condition on using nonsejunct clauses, which hinges on grammatical person features
and on the pragmatic expression of solidarity between speaker and addressee. This
combination of conditions is typologically idiosyncratic, and I know of no other language
which makes use of it (see }9.1 for arguments against analysing sejunct/nonsejunct as
person marking).
Sejunct complementized clauses exhibit overt +sej inﬂection which is realized by
μobl on all words bar subject pronouns. On subject pronouns +sej is realized
by μsej.1
Sejunct complementized clauses are illustrated in (5.19) below with a
third person subject and in (5.1) with a second person subject.

Nonsejunct complementized clauses exhibit overt inﬂection for +comp, which is
realized as μloc on all words bar subject pronouns. On subject pronouns +comp has
no overt realization.2
Examples of nonsejunct subordinate clauses are shown in (5.2)

Historically, the forms in sejunct clauses derive from dative marking: the proto Southern Tangkic
dative was realized by μobl, except on pronouns, where the modern Kayardild μsej pronouns continue the
old dative series (Evans 1995a).

Forms in nonsejunct clauses derive historically from ergative marking: the proto Southern Tangkic
ergative was realized by μloc, except on pronouns where the bare pronominal stem was used (Evans 1995a).

values +sej and +comp are antagonistic, so no word may inﬂect for both. When a
word bears both features +sej will always be realized at the expense of +comp (}4.3.1);
this is summarized in Table 5.2.
The proposal then is that all complementized clauses are associated with a
+comp feature which percolates from S0
 to all subordinate nodes. In addition,
sejunct clauses (but not nonsejunct clauses) are associated with a +sej feature
which percolates from S0
Æ to all subordinate nodes. In the subordinate clauses
under consideration in this section all words are located below both S0
nodes,
entailing that words in nonsejunct clauses will inherit +comp only and will inﬂect
overtly for it, while words in sejunct clauses will inherit both +comp and +sej
will inﬂect overtly only for +sej. The motivations for choosing this analysis over
other alternatives will become clear as we examine other complementized clause
types containing topic and focus DPs.
5.1.2 Complementized main clauses and topic DPs
Figure 5.1 indicates the sets of DPs which can be promoted from their usual position
in the clausal hierarchy to a pair of syntactically distinct, topic and focus positions.
Any clause with a DP promoted to these positions will be complementized.3
Evans (1995a:533–9) documents complementized clauses with several kinds of
topic DP, all of which fail to inﬂect overtly for +sej or +comp. These inﬂectional
facts are analysed here as following from the placement of the topicalized DP as
daughter of S00
at the top of the clause. The features +sej and +comp attach lower
than this and thus the topic DP daughters of S00
are too high in the clause to inherit

The topicalized DPs in (5.4) and (5.5) are both direct object topics. Evans
(1995a:534) also documents ‘instrument’ topics, which occur only in passive clauses.
In both of Evans’ examples, the topic DP itself is elided and inferred from context.
One example is repeated in (5.6). Reasons for why instruments in passive
clauses should count amongst the DPs which can be promoted to topic are discussed
in }5.5.2.

Another type of topicalized DP is the case:locative DP (Evans 1995a:539) as in (5.7).5
4
Notice that in terms of surface syntax, the topic DP in (5.4), which is uninﬂected for +comp, is
straddled by DPs which do carry inﬂection for +comp, illustrating the fact that the non-surface syntactic
structure which determines inﬂectional distributions cannot be equated with constituent structure at the
surface.
5
A complication here is that the inﬂection of both the topicalized DP and of the rest of the clause is
identical in form to the inﬂection of a focus DP and its complementized clause. However, there are
semantic/pragmatic differences between topicalized locative DPs and focalized location DPs (see (5.12) and
following text below), and the example in (5.7) contains a topic DP, rather than a focus DP.

The ﬁnal attested type of topicalized DP is a ‘body part as locus of effect’, as shown in
(5.8). ‘Body part as locus of effect’ DPs can be regarded a species of secondary
predicate in Kayardild (see the suggestion to this effect in Evans 1995a:362–3), so
that the second clause of (5.8) might be paraphrased more literally as ‘you’ll hit
(somebody) eye-wise’. Example (5.8) thus illustrates a DP which has been promoted
to topic from the ‘Obj-pred DP’ position of Figure 5.1.

5.1.3 Complementized main clauses and focus DPs
Evans (1995a) does not describe complementized clauses with focus DPs per se,
although focus DPs which stand alone without any other clausal context (cf }5.1.4
next) are described as being marked by an ‘independent use of locative case’, which is
analysed here as a μloc sufﬁx realizing +comp.
Complementized clauses containing focus DPs are what provides the motivation
for positing both a +comp feature and a +sej feature in sejunct clauses—all other
sejunct clauses such as those in }5.1.1 and }5.1.2 could be described equally well by
assuming that the +comp feature is entirely absent. In this respect the key property of
focus DPs is that they are daughters of S0
 and therefore are low enough to inherit
+comp but too high to inherit +sej. Consequently a focus DP in a sejunct clause will
inherit and inﬂect overtly for +comp while all other constituents will inherit both
+comp and +sej and thus inﬂect overtly only for +sej.6
6
Clauses with focus DPs (}5.1.3) descend historically from a matrix clause ergative DP (marked with
μloc, or unmarked if pronominal) plus a relative clause marked for ergative or dative case. The existence of
such clauses in proto Southern Tangkic has already been reconstructed by Evans (1995a:542–9). The use of
etymologically ergative morphology to mark focus is not entirley unexpected. Ergative marking has
recently been documented in a number of Australian languages as signalling not only grammatical
92 The clause and VP
Since clauses of this type have not been documented before, I give six examples in
(5.9)–(5.14). The ﬁrst three illustrate focus DPs in combination with all three of the
most common tama values found in complementized clauses. The grammatical
functions of the focus DPs are intransitive subject (5.9), transitive subject (5.10),
and transitive object (5.11). The subjects are third person and hence the clauses are
sejunct. The focus DP is shown in bold.

5.1 Complementization and S-category nodes 93
In (5.12) the subject is ﬁrst person inclusive7
so a nonsejunct clause must be used.
All clause constituents inherit +comp and since no +sej feature is involved, all
of them inﬂect overtly for it. The focus DP in (5.12) has been promoted from the
position ‘locational object DP’ in Figure 5.1 (on which, cf }5.5).

The focalized DP kurdaya is not the subject, as a third person subject would require a sejunct clause.
Nor is kurdaya is a direct object, as the verb wuyiij- is intransitive. On the lack of overt case:locative on
kurdaya, see }6.8.
94 The clause and VP
5.1.4 Focus clauses lacking overt VP
The focus DPs construction introduced above is most often used to convey that the
referent of the focalized DP has just come to the speaker’s attention, often because it
has just entered the extra-linguistic context. A common conversational implicature
(Grice 1969; Sperber and Wilson 1986) associated with the focus DP construction is
that the speaker’s reason for articulating this fact is to bring the referent to the
addressee’s attention too. Evans (1995a:141) documents essentially the same meanings
associated with utterances consisting of nominal material alone, inﬂected with μloc,
which I will analyse here as focus DPs in a complementized clausal structure which
lacks any overt VP material. Like all other focus DPs, the focus DPs in such
constructions inherit +comp from above and inﬂect overtly for it. Examples from
Evans (1995a) are shown in (5.15)–(5.16).
(5.15) Wankuya dathinki riinki!
wanku+ki-a ʈat̪in+ki-a ɻi-in+ki-a
shark-μloc-t that-μloc-t east-μablc-μloc-t

ɻacuri-c-n+ki-a
‹walk-j›-μn-μloc-t
‹walk›-prog-cmp
Granny to toddler: ‘Hey you can walk!’ [E142.ex.4-31]
Each of the DPs above are inﬂected with μloc but one might ask, does this μloc
realize +comp, or does it realize tama:instantiated or case:locative, both of which are
also realized by μloc? An answer will emerge by a process of deduction. First, proof
that the μloc is not a realization of tama:instantiated comes from examples such as
(5.17). In (5.17) the word bijarrbawuruy conveys what the song (wangarri) is about,
but ‘subject matter’ DPs of this kind never inﬂect for tama (}5.6.2; also Appendix B,
}B.5.4) and thus the μloc in (5.17) cannot be a realization of tama:instantiated.

8
See also example (10.34) where this same DP appears within an entire clause recorded by Wurm
(1960).
5.1 Complementization and S-category nodes 95
Evidence that μloc is not a realization of case:locative comes from examples
such as (5.18).
(5.18) Ngada rarungki!
ŋat̪-ta ɻa-ɻuŋ+ki-a
1sg-t south-μallc-μloc-t
1sg(cmp) south-allc-cmp
A man has returned to Bentinck Island (the ‘south’ island) for the ﬁrst time
in decades: ‘(Look at) me in the south!’ [R2005-jul05b]
If it were associated with case:locative (or with tama:instantiated for that matter)
the ﬁrst singular pronoun in (5.18) ought to have appeared as ngijinji, a possessive
pronominal stem followed by μloc, which it does not. Instead it appears as the
plain pronoun which is expected in association with +comp (since pronouns do not
inﬂect overtly for +comp, }5.1.1). Meanwhile compass-direction allative stems such
as rarung- do not inﬂect for case:locative or tama:instantiated (cf }5.6.2;
Appendix B, }B.4.4) but are expected to inﬂect for +comp, as the stem does in
(5.18). Thus the inﬂection of both words in (5.18) is inconsistent with an analysis in
terms of case:locative or tama:instantiated, while an account in terms of +comp is
without problem. Despite the lack of overt VP material in examples such as (5.15)–
(5.18), the inﬂection of their μloc-marked DPs exactly matches that of the focus DPs
of }5.1.3, just as their semantics matches. The appropriate analysis is therefore as
daughters of S00
 which inherit and inﬂect for +comp.
5.2 The attachment of tamt and negation
For morphomic reasons the features tamt and negation are only overtly realized on
verbs, adverbs, DPs inﬂected with thematic case values, and words in ‘incipient’
clauses (cf }5.4.1). In the sections which follow I will present reasons to believe that
all of these constituents sit below the lowest VP node, VPÆ. One approach to
the attachment site of tamt and +neg would therefore be to assume that they attach
as low as possible, at VPÆ, and percolate down from there. Proposing any higher
attachment site would be vacuous insofar as it would not change one’s predictions
regarding which constituents in the general case should inﬂect for tamt and +neg.
Thus, in cases where there is no evidence to the contrary, I will assume that tamt
values attach at VPÆ. However, for some values of tamt, and for +neg, a second
factor does comes into play.
As mentioned in Chapter 4 each clause in Kayardild associates with one value
of tamt, one value of tama, and sometimes with +neg. In }5.4 we will see
that Kayardild possesses a set of embedded VP clauses. Many tamt values and
the feature +neg never associate with embedded VPs (see also }4.3.3), although
96 The clause and VP
they can associate with full clauses. The absence of such features in association with
embedded VP constituents can be accounted for by supposing that they attach above
the maximal VP node, VP, in which case only clausal constituents larger than VP
can associate with them.9
A list of tamt features and +neg, and their association with
clause types, is shown in Table 5.3.
We have established that the features in Table 5.3(a) attach above VP, but not yet
precisely where. In terms of their linear order of morphological realization, each of
the features in Table 5.3(a) is realized closer to the stem than +sej and +comp. This
suggests that their node of attachment is lower (or at least no higher) than the nodes
to which +sej and +comp attach (}4.5.6). I will therefore assume that the feature
values in Table 5.3(a) attach at S.10
5.3 Embedded S00
Kayardild possesses two kinds of embedded, clause-like constituents (Evans
1995:451). One which I analyse as embedded S00
(the maximal projection of the clause)
never inherits morphosyntactic features from clauses above it, and can always
contain a subject. The other which I analyse as embedded VP (the maximal VP
projection) always inherits morphosyntactic features from nodes above it and

Notwithstanding this, an embedded VP can and will inherit features via percolation from its matrix
clause: see }5.7
10
Strictly speaking it would be possible to conﬂate the nodes S and S0
Æ into one and have +sej, tamt,
and +neg attach to it. This would mean that tamt and +neg would notionally percolate down onto the
subject and subject second predicate DP daughters of the conﬂated node, even though nothing in those
DPs ever inﬂects for tamt or +neg. Technically this would not be problematic, since no words in those
DPs are of the right morphomic shape to inﬂect for tamt or +neg, thus even if they inherited the features
they would not inﬂect for them. The choice here not to conﬂate the nodes is made for expository reasons; it
is distracting to have features that are never realized percolating onto subjects. On a typological note, the
majority of languages reported in Nordlinger and Sadler (2004) which inﬂect their DPs for clause-leveltam
features do inﬂect subjects. If one did conﬂate S and S0
Æ then Kayardild would (covertly) also conform to
that pattern.
5.3 Embedded S00
97
never contains a subject. Embedded S00
is discussed in this section and embedded VP
in }5.4. For a detailed treatment of embedded S00
in terms of its functions
and conditions on its use see Evans (1995a:ch.12) under the rubric of ‘ﬁnite subordin-
ate clauses’; for VP see Evans (1995a:ch.11) under ‘non-ﬁnite clauses’.11
An embedded S00
constituent does not inherit any features from its matrix clause.
Accordingly it will be assumed here that the S00
node, the maximal node of the clause,
uniquely constitutes an opaque barrier to all feature percolation. Embedded S00
clauses themselves may be complementized or uncomplementized, as illustrated
respectively in (5.19) and (5.20). See also (9.24) for an embedded complementized
S00
within a matrix complementized clause.

Like other S00
constituents, an embedded S00
may or may nor contain an overt subject,
as illustrated in (5.19) and (5.20) respectively. Perception verbs such as kurrij- ‘see’ in
(5.19) can take embedded S00
complements (Evans 1995a:512–13), as can predicate
nominals such as mungurru ‘know that [S00
]’, which appears in example (4.10).
11
Although Evans (1995a) arranges his discussion under the headings of ‘ﬁnite’ and ‘nominalized’
clauses, ﬁniteness itself does not correlate perfectly with the division which is made, since ‘motion purpose’
clauses are ﬁnite on Evans’ account but they pattern syntactically with ‘nominalized’ clauses. I prefer to
view the distinction in terms of the syntactic constituents involved rather than their verbal morphology.

Sentences containing embedded S00

further discussion of recursion in Kayardild.
5.4 Embedded VP
In terms of their function there are two main kinds of embedded VP clause. The ﬁrst,
which I will term adnominal, modiﬁes or contributes a second predicate to a matrix
subject or object DP,12
while the second kind, which I will refer to as adverbial,
denotes certain kinds of secondary events related to the event of the main clause.
Examples of the two kinds appear in (5.21) and (5.22) respectively.

This section will be concerned with identifying the permissible internal constituents
of embedded VPs and accounting for their inﬂection, and giving a brief character-
ization of the VPs’ functions. Questions of where exactly in their matrix clauses
embedded VPs sit must await further discussion below, although a synopsis runs
as follows. Evans (1995a:451) observes that embedded VP clauses exhibit distribu-
tional properties that parallel DPs, and the analysis here will be that they sit inside
a DP, as an adjunct to N0
(}7.5). The DPs which contain the embedded VP clauses
then occupy syntactic positions equivalent to subject or object DPs in the case of

Embedded VPs do not contain overt subjects. The implicit subjects of adnominal
VPs are coreferential with the matrix argument (i.e. subject or object) which they
modify or supply second predicates to. The implicit subjects of adverbial embedded
VPs are always coreferential with the matrix subject. Structurally, embedded VPs
are VP constituents, that is, instances of the maximal VP projection. Arguments for
this will emerge as the data are examined below.
5.4.1 Adverbial embedded VP
Here we examine adverbial embedded VPs, of which there are three semantic kinds.
Two of them are not analysed as clausal constituents in Evans (1995a) and to that
extent their syntactic analysis here is novel.
Adverbial embedded VPs sit within a DP daughter of V0
. This is low enough in
their matrix clause for them to inherit by percolation any tamt and tama feature
associated with the matrix clause (see also }5.7). In addition, and as for any clause in
Kayardild, adverbial embedded VPs associate with their own tamt and tama
features, and thus their internal constituents may inﬂect for tam features associated
both with the embedded VP and the matrix clause. The ﬁrst semantic type of
adverbial embedded VP is the ‘motion purpose’ VP. These are analysed as embedded
VPs both in Evans (1995a:486–7) and in the present account, and are illustrated
in (5.22) above. Motion purpose adverbial VPs denote an event which is the purpose
for the movement event denoted in the main clause. Morphosyntactically they
associate with tama:directed (glossed dira) and tamt:directed (glossed dirt) and
they inherit tam features from the matrix clause (in (5.22) the matrix features were
tamt:potential and tama:future). For morphomic reasons the words in a motion
purpose clause will inﬂect for matrix tama, and not matrix tamt. This follows from
the fact that the realization of both of the embedded tam features, tamt:directed and
tama:directed, is the morphomic string μloc-μall. That string does not end in a
thematic and hence when any word in the motion purpose clause comes to be
inﬂected for matrix tam, it is the athematic matrix tama feature which is realized.
In example (5.23) the matrix features are tamt:past and tama:prior. The verb in the
motion purpose clause inﬂects for its local tamt value (dirt) and its matrix tama
value, tama:prior.

100 The clause and VP
The only internal constituents attested in motion purpose clauses are verbs and direct
objects.
The second semantic kind of adverbial embedded VP is an ‘instrument purpose’
clause which denotes the use to which an instrument will be put which is obtained or
created in the event denoted by matrix clause. Instrument purpose clauses associate
inherently with tamt:progressive and tama:functional and they inherit matrix tam
features as well. Examples (5.24)–(5.26) illustrate instrument purpose clauses embed-
ded in matrix clauses associated with a variety of tam values. Example (5.24)
demonstrates that instrument purpose clauses are not merely relative clauses on
matrix DPs. In (5.24) the matrix verb ngamburath ‘dig a hole’ is intransitive and
thus the entity (a cooking trench), whose instrument-like purpose is denoted by
the embedded clause, is not an argument in the matrix clause; its existence is
merely entailed by the matrix verb’s semantics. The matrix tama value in (5.24) is
tama:instantiated, which is inherited by the embedded VP.

tama:. Because the matrix tama value is  no overt marking for it is visible in
either the matrix clause or the embedded adverbial VP.

In both (5.24) and (5.25) the only DP in the embedded clause was a direct object.
In (5.26) the embedded clause contains the intransitive verb wuyii- ‘put on self ’.
This verb never takes a direct object but it can collocate with either a ‘body part as
locus of effect’ second predicate or, as here in (5.26), with a locational object (in the
non-surface syntax locational objects are sisters of direct objects, see }5.5.2). The
elided matrix verb in (5.26) is ‘cut’.

[W1960]
Evans (1995a:161) weighs up two potential analyses for the constructions identiﬁed here
as instrument purpose adverbial clauses: the ﬁrst as a clause, and the second as a series of
juxtaposed case:utilitive DPs and derivationally nominalized verbs. For the latter
alternative, the overall ‘instrument purpose’ meaning ought to arise compositionally
from the meanings of the individual case-marked nouns and nominalized verbs. Evans
observes that the former analysis would accord better with the semantics of the
construction,14
but opts for the latter on the grounds that it avoids imputing multiple
functions to nominals marked with μutil and verbs marked with μn. A central theme
of this book, however, is that polyfunctionality is ubiquitous in Kayardild and so the
avoidance of it is little reason to opt for a semantically less advantageous analysis.
I therefore adopt a clausal analysis, in which μutil realizes tama and μn realizes tamt.
13
This sentence was recorded by Wurm (1960) and contains a rather long pause after the ﬁrst wumbur-
umarr. Both Evans (1995a) and Round (2009) analyse only the portion after the pause, resulting in the
interpretation of the embedded clause as a main clause. Taking into account the full context, the generaliza-
tion emerges, that instrument purpose clauses are always embedded and always inﬂect for matrix tama.
14
The difﬁculty for the juxtapositional alternative is that the desired semantics are not derivable
compositionally. Although nominalized verbs in Kayardild can denote instruments (Evans 1995a:458),
they must take their middle form to do so. The would-be ‘nominalized verbs’ in sentences like (5.24)–(5.26)
are all active and so cannot contribute the ‘instrument’ reading required.
102 The clause and VP
The third semantic kind of adverbial embedded VP is the ‘incipient’ clause. Evans
(1995:170) analyses this construction as juxtaposed case:translative DPs and nominal-
ized verbs. Based on the sample of sentences Evans adduces the analysis is semantically
plausible,15
but my own expanded corpus contains additional senses which cannot be
reconciled with the juxtapositional analysis, and so I adopt a clausal analysis. Incipient
clauses have a range of functions whose common semantic basis appears to be the
denotation of an event which will occur soon after the event in the main clause. From
that basispragmaticimplicaturescancontribute further nuances,yielding‘[main clause]
until [incipient clause]’, ‘[main clause] while awaiting [incipient clause]’ (both observed
by Evans 1995a), as well as ‘[main clause] in order to [incipient clause]’ and ‘[main
clause] and then [incipient clause]’. Incipient clauses associate inherently with tama:
incipient and tamt:incipient (glossed incpa and incpt). Because tama:incipient and
tamt:incipient are both realized by morphomic strings which end in a thematic, the
words in an incipient clause also inﬂect for matrix tamt (and not matrix tama as in the
adverbial clauses above). In (5.27) the embedded clause contains a verb and a locational
object; the matrix tamt feature inherited is tamt:actual.

Incipient clauses often embed inside matrix clauses in which all content is elided
bar the subject, with the resultant meaning ‘Subject is about to [incipient clause]’.
The presence of the main clause in the non-surface syntax is still evident because
its tamt feature percolates down to the embedded clause. Examples are shown in
(5.29) and (5.30) where the matrix tamt features are the tamt:directed and tamt:
progressive respectively. The incipient clause in (5.29) contains two head verbs
(regarding the appearance of multiple head verbs in Kayardild clauses more generally
see }5.5.1), and the clause in (5.30) contains a verb and direct object.

We have now examined the three semantic kinds of adverbial embedded VP clauses
in Kayardild. Adverbial clauses always inherit tam features from their matrix clause.
Regarding their internal constituents, they are only attested containing verbs and
DPs which are complements of V. In anticipation of the discussion below, it is worth
noting that my corpus contains only very few adverbial embedded VPs in the passive
voice, and this may be signiﬁcant in terms of what internal constituents have been
attested.
104 The clause and VP
5.4.2 Adnominal embedded VP
Adnominal embedded VPs modify or contribute second predicates to subjects and
direct objects in the matrix clause, with which the implicit subject of the embedded
VP is coreferential. In just one questionable case an embedded VP appears to modify
a case:proprietive DP, but see }9.3 for discussion and reservations. Adnominal
embedded VPs may or may not inherit tam features from their matrix clauses; this
will not be discussed here, but see }5.7 for why this is unexceptional.
It will be convenient to divide the discussion of adnominal embedded VPs into
VPs in the active voice and VPs in the passive. We should also note that ‘resultative’
adnominal embedded VPs (those associated with tamt:resultative) have what Evans
(1995a:476) has characterized as an ergative syntax: clauses headed by intransitive
verbs are active but those headed by transitive verbs are passive (even though the verb
is not marked with the usual μmid middle/passive sufﬁx), thus it is their logical object
which is obligatorily unexpressed and coreferential with a matrix clause argument,
while their logical subject may be overt, appearing in a range of special case forms.
There are four pairs of tama and tamt features which can associate inherently
with the clauses in adnominal VPs. These are listed together with the internal
constituents that are attested in those VPs in Table 5.4 (active) and Table 5.5
(passive).
Like the adverbial embedded VPs in }5.4.1, adnominal embedded VPs in the active
voice only contain constituents that are located below VPÆ. Example (5.21) above
contains a thematic case DP thungalwulanki. Example (5.31) contains a locational
object malawarriya, and (5.32) a motion adverb, dananngarrb.

Adnominal embedded VPs in the passive voice are attested with a different range
of internal DP constituents. Example (5.33) contains a demoted, logical subject
dalururdalurungarrbaya, which is syntactically encoded as a locational object (on
which see }5.5.2). Other examples are (5.48) with a case:ablative demoted logical
subject makuwalathinabay (note the embedded VP in (5.48) is discontinuous in the
surface syntax), and (5.49) with a case:genitive demoted logical subject kamarrkarra.

[E1984-3-1]
The attested internal constituents of adnominal embedded VPs in the passive voice
are listed in Table 5.5. Unlike the internal constituents of active adnominal embedded
VPs, not all of them are located below VPÆ. In }5.6 it will be demonstrated that the
ablative and genitive case DPs in Table 5.5 are daughters of VP and thus are situated
well above VPÆ in the non-surface syntax.
With the information now at hand let us formulate some generalizations regarding
the internal syntax of embedded VPs. First, in the general case embedded VPs will
need to contain structure as high as VP, the maximal VP projection, in order to
106 The clause and VP
accommodate the DPs listed in Table 5.5. This accords well with the inﬂectional facts
relating to tama, as the attested tama values in embedded VPs include values which,
as we will see in }5.6, attach at VP, VPª, and VP. All of those attachment sites are
accounted for if embedded VPs contain structure as high as VP. Returning our
attention to the range of internal DP constituents permitted in embedded VPs, it can
be deﬁned in terms of a disjoint condition which refers to both non-surface syntactic
structure and argument structure, as in (5.34).
(5.34) Condition on constituents in embedded VPs
Constituents in embedded VPs must be either or both:
(i) Below VPÆ
(ii) Demoted logical subjects of passive verbs (including resultative transitives)
The disjoint nature of condition (5.34) comes about as a result of history. It permits
all and only those constituents which are either (i) logical subjects or logical objects
of verbs, including direct and locational objects (on which, see }5.5.2), or (ii) constitu-
ents derived historically from verbs, including modern Kayardild’s verbs, adverbs,
and thematic case-marked DPs.
5.4.3 Main clauses are less constrained than matching embedded VPs
Several of the pairs of tama and tamt features which associate with embedded VPs,
which we may call embeddable tam features, can also associate with main clauses
(cf }4.3). To conclude our discussion of embedded VPs, it will be interesting to ask
whether main clauses with embeddable tam features face the same set of constraints
on their internal constituents as do embedded clauses. If so, then the main clauses
might be considered simple ‘insubordinated’ clauses—embedded clauses which
appear without their matrix clause, other than its subject. A suggestion along these
lines may be implicit in Evans’ (1995a) discussion of ‘non-ﬁnite clauses’

a
Evans (1995a:477–9) also documents ‘demoted subjects’ in case:origin and case:consequential DPs. However
given the general function of those case values to mark causes or conditions under which something happens, the
DPs in question could equally be analysed as being juxtaposed (cf }7.5) and directly modifying the matrix clause
argument rather than being constituents of the embedded clause.
5.4 Embedded VP 107
(corresponding roughly to my clauses with embeddable tam), which mentions no
differences in the internal constituency of similarly inﬂected embedded versus main
clauses, despite otherwise covering them in depth.
In fact main clauses with embeddable tam features exhibit a signiﬁcantly
expanded range of internal DP constituents relative to their corresponding embed-
ded clauses. Just like all other main clauses they are constrained, at least in the general
case,16
by neither of the subconditions in (5.34). To provide a sample, (5.35) is a main
clause with embeddable tama:negatory and tamt:nonveridical which contains an
ablative compass locational DP riinmarriya, which is a daughter of VP (}5.6.2)
and thus above VPÆ yet not a demoted logical subject (and thus in violation
of condition 5.34). Sentence (5.36) is a main clause with embeddable tama:directed
and tamt:directed which contains a case:proprietive instrument DP and a
case:proprietive ‘subject matter’ DP both of which sit above VPÆ (}5.6.2) and also
violate condition (5.34).

5.5 The clause below VPa
The lowest part of the clause, below VPÆ, is shown Figure 5.2. This region contains
the head verb (or verbs) of the clause, its direct object and S00
clausal complements,
and adverb phrases, as well as what I will term ‘locational object’ DPs and second
predicates on the object. These constituents lie below all of the nodes to which
+comp, + sej, +neg, tamt, and tama attach and they therefore inherit them all.
16
Many speciﬁc combinations of clausal tam and internal DP types are absent from my corpus. It is
conceivable that a much larger corpus might prove some such gaps to be non-accidental.
108 The clause and VP
5.5.1 Clauses with multiple verb heads
There is good reason to analyse the Kayardild clause as accommodating multiple
head verbs, conditional upon their having non-contradictory argument structures
(Evans 1995a:302–3).17
Speciﬁcally this demands (i) that the subjects of the multiple
head verbs all be the same, encoded (if overt) as the subject of the clause, and (ii) that
the objects of the transitive head verbs be the same, encoded (if overt) as the direct
object of the clause. Transitive and intransitive head verbs may mix freely so long as
their subjects are shared. Sentence (5.37) contains two transitive head verbs whose
subjects and object are both shared. Example (5.38) contains a transitive and an
intransitive head verb whose subject is shared.

‘Yesterday the wind tricked us as it arrived.’ [R2006-sep25]
The requirement on shared arguments does not extend to body parts encoded as
‘body part as locus of effect’ second predicates, and this is one reason for regarding
such body part DPs as different from subjects or objects per se. Example (5.29) shows
a clause with multiple intransitive head verbs and a subject body part second
predicate DP, and (5.40) below contains in its second clause two transitive head
verbs and an object body part second predicate.

The verbs in (5.39) share their subject ngijuwa ‘I’, but only wuyiijuuntha ‘put into
self ’ combines with the subject second predicate bardakantha ‘belly’ to predicate ‘put
into self belly-wise’, that is, ‘feed self ’. The verb warrajuuntha does not combine with
bardakantha to predicate ‘go belly-wise’, rather the predicate is simply ‘go’. In the
second clause of (5.40) the verbs share their direct object niwanjiya ‘him’ but only the
verb buuja combines with the object second predicate mariya ‘hand’, to predicate
‘pull him hand-wise’, that is, ‘lead him by the hand’. If the verb thaarij had combined
with second predicate mariya the resultant interpretation would be the more grue-
some ‘brought back his hand’.

This indicates that the rules on combining multiple head verbs in a single clause treat
subjects and objects differently to their respective second predicates. This fact comes
in addition to the observation in }5.1.3, that subjects and their secondary predicates
can be promoted to the focus DP position independently of one another. Accordingly
I assume that the semantic and argument structure components of Kayardild gram-
mar represent subjects and objects distinctly from their second predicates. However,
in terms of inﬂection second predicates display identical behaviour to subjects and
objects, and for that reason I place them in equivalent positions in the non-surface
syntax, given that the purpose of the non-surface syntax in this study is solely to
account for generalizations in the inﬂectional system (cf }4.5.2).
5.5.2 DPs promotable to higher positions
Inﬂectional evidence reveals the existence in Kayardild of three syntactically privil-
eged types of DP, all of which are low in the clause (below VPÆ) and all of which
110 The clause and VP
(i) can be promoted to focus and topic DPs positions; (ii) can be promoted to subject
or subject second predicate in the passive counterparts of active clauses; and (iii) are
free to occur in active embedded VPs. As one would expect, one of these DP types is
the direct object. Another is the object second predicate. The third class of privileged
DP is decidedly less expected: it is a class of DPs with (as one realizational option)
locative case. Evidence for these claims will be presented here from passivization,
focalization, and topicalization. Particular attention is paid to ‘locational objects’
since both their existence and their nature is typological rather idiosyncratic.
As Evans (1995a:348–52) documents, both direct objects and locations can be
promoted to subject when their clause is passivized, making passivization the ﬁrst
area in which direct objects and locations pattern alike. A promoted locative appears
in (5.41).

‘(They)spokeinanother place.Thatplacemustn’t bespoken in.’ [E352.ex.9-147]
In }5.1.3 we saw that focalization applies to subjects and to subject second predicates,
and also to direct objects and location-denoting DPs.
In }5.1.2 we saw that topicalization applies to direct objects, their secondary
predicates and to DPs denoting locations (the latter in case:locative). Curiously,
topicalization also applies to ‘instruments’ in passive clauses, or put another way, to
non-human demoted logical subjects. Why non-human demoted subjects, of all DP
types, should be susceptible to topicalization requires some comment. The reasons
turn out to be coherent.
Evans (1995a:351) documents non-human demoted subjects, both animate and
inanimate, inﬂecting like locations. In the examples provided by Evans the demoted
subject DPs are inﬂectionally equivalent to locations encoded as case:locative DPs
below VP (on which see Appendix B, }B.1.2), the key fact being that they inﬂect for
any tama value. So: both literal locations and non-human demoted subjects can be
encoded as case:locative daughters of VP. Pursuing this further, an alternative
encoding is available for literal location DPs, as case: daughters of VPª (on
which see Appendix B, }B.4.1). In such instances the location DPs avoid inﬂection
for tama values that attach to VP and show no inﬂection for case. In (5.42) we ﬁnd
exactly the same encoding of a demoted inanimate subject narraa ‘knife’, which
5.5 The clause below VPa 111
appears as a case: daughter of VPª, inﬂected neither for tama:instantiated (which
attaches to VP) nor case.
(5.42) Bana junkuwa kalaaj, narraa.

and straight-t cut-‹μmid-j›-t knife-t
and straight cut-‹mid› knife
‘And it’s cut straight through by the knife.’ [R2005-jul08]
The emerging pattern is that non-human demoted subjects exhibit precisely the range
of (morpho)syntactic realizations exhibited by literal locations, in terms of case, the
mother VP node below which the DP sits, and it susceptibility to topicalization.18,19
My interpretation is that non-human demoted subjects are representationally equiva-
lent to location-denoting DPs at some level. If that is so, then topicalization is just like
focalization and promotion to subject in passive clauses, in that it operates on direct
objects, their second predicates, and on locational DPs. The one question remaining is
how independent these promotions-of-DP are from one another.
There is no evidence to suggest that object second predicates ever fail to be
promoted to subject second predicates when the direct object is promoted to subject
during passivization. (I have no evidence which speaks to whether object secondary
predicates will automatically be promoted to topic or focus when the direct object is.)
On the other hand locational DPs and direct object DPs undergo promotion
independently. In (5.43) the initial, case:locative locational DP has been topicalized
and hence only inﬂects for case, while the direct object shown in bold remains in situ
and consequently inﬂects for tama:future and +sej.

In (5.44) the logical object has been promoted to passive subject but the location
DP in bold remains in situ below VPÆ and so inﬂects for tama:instantiated.
18
I do not have any examples of focalization in passive clauses.
19
The fact that non-human demoted subjects can be topicalized does not appear to follow from their
semantic role, given that human demoted subjects cannot be topicalized. (Human demoted subjects inﬂect
for case:ablative or case:oblique, case values which are not used to mark literal locations.)

5.5.3 Adverbs
Adverbs come in several semantic types (Evans 1995a:302–12), such as manner adverbs
(e.g. kuruluth- ‘do intensely’), aspectual adverbs (eg. karrngij- ‘keep doing’) and the
quantiﬁcational adverb bakiij- ‘all do; do to all’. A small class of motion adverbs20
exhibit distinctive surface syntactic behaviour and are discussed further in }9.1.1.
Unlike the multiple head verbs in }5.5.1 adverbs do not contribute semantic
roles to subjects and objects, and on that semantic basis they are analysed here
as occupying AdvP constituents below V0
 rather than being an additional kind
of V head.21
Adverbs sit low in the clause and thus inherit the same features
as V heads and inﬂect identically to them. It can be noted in passing that adverbs
do not need to agree with head verbs in terms of middle voice marking or reciprocal
marking, though kuruluth- ‘do intensely’ may appear reciprocalized as kuruluthuth-
‘do intensely to one another’, as in (5.8) above.
5.6 VP nodes and the attachment of tama
We shift now to the topic of tama features and the articulated set of four VP nodes
from VP to VP. Tama feature values attach to VP nodes which in turn dominate
DP adjuncts and other VP nodes. Different values of tama attach to different nodes
and hence have different, and embedded, domains. In the current section, }5.6.1
introduces the basic relationships of tama values to one another, in terms of the
embedding of their domains and its analysis in terms of hierarchical non-surface
syntax, }5.6.2 summarizes the empirical data which stands behind these claims, and
}5.6.3 reviews the reasons why a syntactic analysis of these facts is preferable to an
alternative, ‘diacritic’ analysis. In }}5.7–5.9 attention turns to three individual topics
related to tama, respectively matrix tama in embedded clauses, tama in verbless
clauses, and tama in relation to VP-internal topic DPs.
5.6.1 The domains of individual tama values
Different tama values may have different domains, and those domains are hierarch-
ically embedded within one another. Table 5.6 shows the embedding relationships
20
These are Evans’ ‘motion verbs’ (1995a:308–11).
21
Whether this is ultimately the best syntactic analysis of Kayardild adverbs, or whether a serialized
head V analysis is preferable cannot be determined from the inﬂectional data itself, and consequently a
deﬁnitive answer to the question lies beyond the scope of this study.
5.6 VP nodes and the attachment of tama 113
between the various domains of tama values, and of +sej and +comp. (The domains
of the antecedent, precondition, and functional tama values are underdetermined by
the currently available data).
To account for this the values of tama are analysed each as attaching to one of
three non-surface syntactic nodes, hierarchically arranged with respect to one
another, and with respect to S, as shown in Figure 5.3. The DP daughters of the
VP node are those which associate with no value of tama, even though they are
neither subjects, subject second predicates, topic DPs, nor focus DPs.
The observation that tama domains are embedded within one another is not new
in the description of Kayardild, though many details are. Evans (1995a) makes a
fundamental distinction between associating case, which corresponds to
tama:continuous and has the equal-widest conﬁrmed domain of the tama values,
versus modal case which corresponds to most other tama values and has a
narrower domain. Evans also observes that some DP types which generally inﬂect

where:

114 The clause and VP
for modal case fail to do so for tama:instantiated.22
That observation is reﬁned here
in two respects. First, tama:instantiated and tama:directed pattern together: any DP
which escapes inﬂection for tama:instantiated also escapes inﬂection for tama:
directed. Second, Evans’ observation, cast in terms of his instantiated modality
is valid only in uncomplementized clauses. In complementized clauses, what Evans
identiﬁes as instantiated modality patterns with the majority of tama values, such
as emotive, future, prior, and so forth, and takes a wider domain.23
To take account of
this the analysis presented here splits Evans’ instantiated modality into tama:
instantiated in uncomplementized clauses, and tama:present in complementized
clauses.24
5.6.2 The VP mother nodes of DP adjuncts
Appendix B presents a substantial volume of new data, and newly collated existing
data, attesting the patterns of tama inﬂection for many different types of DP. The data
support the analysis that any given DP type may follow one of only four patterns of
tama inﬂection: (i) it may inﬂect for no tama values; (ii) it may inﬂect only for tama
values that attach to VP; (iii) it may inﬂect only for tama values that attach to VP or
VPª; or (iv) it may inﬂect for all values—that is, for values which attach to VP, VPª, or
VP. DPs of type (i) are located above all of the nodes to which tama features attach,
and so cannot inherit those features via percolation; they include topic and focus DP
daughters of S00
and S0
, subjects and subject second predicate daughters of S0
Æ, and
adjunct DP daughters of VP. DPs of type (ii) are adjunct daughters of VP, and inherit
via percolation only those tama features which attach to VP. DPs of type (iii) are
adjunct daughters of VPª, and inherit via percolation tama features which attach to
either VP or VPª. DPs of type (iv) inherit all tama features and thus must be located
somewhere below VP; they include complement DPs of V, adjunct DP daughters of
VP, and the DP daughters of V0
 which contain adverbial embedded clauses.
We may next ask, what properties of a DP are correlated with the mother node
beneath which the DP appears in the non-surface syntax? In the general case, the
decisive property is the DP’s semantic or grammatical role in the clause. Occasionally
though the lexical class of the head N of the NP overrides this. Moreover, because a
DP’s case value is correlated to a large extent with its semantic/grammatical role,
tama behaviour is often fully predictable from a DP’s case value. Table 5.7 summarizes
22
These observations are made with respect to individual DP types throughout Evans (1995a). A general
note and accompanying table appear at one point (1995a:110), but they under-represent the true variety of
DP types which are recognized elsewhere in Evans (1995a) as participating in this pattern.
23
Evans (1995a:496) remarks upon this with respect to a subset of the affected DPs.
24
This division of Evans’ (1995a) instantiated modality into tama:instantiated and tama:present is
not without its semantic basis: tama:instantiated (in uncomplementized clauses) has a broader, non-future
meaning, while tama:present (in complementized clauses) can have a narrower, present tense meaning
(Evans 1995a:511–12).
5.6 VP nodes and the attachment of tama 115
the inﬂectional behaviours of DPs which one would typically regard as corresponding
to ‘semantic arguments’ in a clause. ‘Adverbial’ DPs appear in Table 5.8. Some adver-
bial DPs exhibit variable behaviour and are listed twice, and a question mark ‘(?)’ in
Table 5.8 indicates that the relevant data are unavailable. The reader is referred to
Appendix B for the full data sets on which the summaries in Tables 5.7 and 5.8 are
based, and for minor comments.
A glance at the placement of various types of DP in Tables 5.7 and 5.8 reveals a
signiﬁcant degree of idiosyncrasy. The task of distilling DP types into coherent
groups whose inﬂectional behaviour could then be predicted en bloc is challenging,
and will not be attempted here.
5.6.3 Arguments for a syntactic analysis
Although the precise pattern of tama inﬂection that applies for a given DP type can
be idiosyncratic, the patterns are highly constrained, with just four possibilities

available. This section details why a syntactic analysis of the facts of Kayardild tama
inﬂection is preferable to an alternative which at ﬁrst glance appears plausible and
perhaps even simpler, and which can be referred to as a ‘diacritic’ analysis. Under the
diacritic analysis each DP type is associated not with a syntactic mother node but
with a diacritic which marks it as a member of one of four classes, corresponding to
the four possibilities for tama inﬂection. The analyses measure up against one
another as follows.
Both analyses permit DP types to associate idiosyncratically with the available
patterns of tama inﬂection, and both analyses contain a reasonable mechanism for
constraining the number of attested patterns to just four types. However, under a
syntactic analysis it also follows that the four patterns relate to one another in an
embedded fashion: if pattern X involves more tama values than pattern Y, then it will
involve all the values of pattern Y, plus one or more additional value. By employing a
syntactic analysis an implicit claim is made that the embedding of domains is a
fundamental structural property of the Kayardild inﬂectional system. This is not the
case under a diacritic analysis. To be sure, a diacritic analysis can reproduce

embedding, but it will either treat that embedding as accidental, or its non-accidental
status will need to be stipulated. Moreover, once we consider the nature of tama
inﬂection within embedded VPs it will become clear that embedding really is
fundamental to the Kayardild inﬂectional system. The diacritic analysis not only
fails to express that fact but struggles even to describe the data.
The details of tama inﬂection in embedded VPs are expanded upon in }5.7 next,
but can be summarized now. Unsurprisingly from the point of view of the syntactic
analysis, we ﬁnd that embedded VPs inherit tam features from VP nodes above
them, and that all DPs in those embedded VPs inﬂect for such features—this includes
DPs which normally (i.e. in a matrix clause) do not inﬂect for tama features because
they are syntactically higher than the node from which those features percolate.
These facts are captured awkwardly at best under a diacritic analysis: we must
independently stipulate that DPs of any class act as if they were in a different class
when inside an embedded VP. In addition, many DPs in embedded VPs inﬂect for
not one but two tama features (one originating from a node inside the embedded VP,
and one from a node in the matrix clause). On the diacritic analysis, these DPs would
have to be simultaneous members of two classes—two hierarchically ordered
classes—in which case, the very ‘classhood’ of a DP begins to behave as if it were a
feature percolating down a syntactic tree.
In short, a syntactic analysis of the distribution of tama inﬂection correctly treats
domain embedding as something fundamental to the organization of Kayardild
morphosyntax, and it extends without any complications to the most complex
data. Neither of these virtues is shared by the diacritic analysis.
5.7 Matrix clause tama in embedded VPs
This section sets out the evidence referred to above, that embedded VP nodes inherit
tama features in a normal way, as do all of the constituents within them.
During this section we will encounter some of the most complicated morphology
in Kayardild, and it will be helpful to bear in mind three key properties of Kayardild
inﬂection: (i) because morphosyntactic feature values attach to a node n and then
percolate down to all subordinate nodes, a word at terminal node z will inﬂect (all
else equal) for all feature values which attach to all nodes that are superordinate to z;
(ii) inﬂectional sufﬁxes generally25
appear in a linear order reﬂecting the syntactic
height of a feature value’s node of attachment: the closer the node of attachment is to
the terminal z, the closer to the lexical stem its corresponding sufﬁx appears; (iii) each
clause associates with a set TC of values for the features tama, tamt and (sometimes)
+neg, of which a word can inﬂect either for tamt/neg or for tama but not both;
(iv) a word is able to inﬂect for tamt/neg if the stem to which the sufﬁx attaches
ends morphomically in a thematic (glossed th or j), and otherwise it can inﬂect for
25
This will be true in all examples in this section; see }2.6.4 for the exceptionality of μobl.
118 The clause and VP
tama. Once we examine words in embedded clauses, we ﬁnd that the antagonism
between tamt/neg and tama is constrained to features associated with the same
clause; features from different clauses are never antagonistic. As a consequence
deeply embedded words which inherit features from two clauses can and will inﬂect
for tam features from both.
All embedded VPs in Kayardild are analysed as sitting within a DP; the reasons for
this will be accumulated in Chapters 6–8. The syntactic locations of those DPs within
their matrix clause are listed in Table 5.9.

5.7 Matrix clause tama in embedded VPs 119
The positions in Table 5.9 are shown in Figure 5.4. In Figure 5.4 and in other
syntactic diagrams in this section dashed lines indicate sections of structure which
have been abbreviated by skipping intermediate nodes. Without exception, the DPs
which contain embedded VPs in Kayardild are located either above, or below, all of
the nodes to which tama values attach.
We will now consider subordinate VPs embedded at various syntactic positions in
the matrix clause. In particular we are interested in the position of the embedded VP
relative to the node in the matrix clause to which the matrix tama feature attaches.
In (5.45) the embedded VP has the function of a depictive second predicate on
the subject and is contained within a DP daughter of S. The tam values of the matrix
clause are tama:future and tamt:potential. The inherent tam values of the embed-
ded clause are tama:antecedent and tamt:antecedent.

120 The clause and VP
In this instance nothing in the embedded VP inﬂects for matrix tama even though,
for example, the DP within the embedded clause is a direct object, a DP type which
always inﬂects for the tama value of its own clause. The reason for this can be seen in
Figure 5.5, which reproduces the relevant aspects of the non-surface syntactic struc-
ture of (5.45). In addition to a representation of the syntactic tree, Figure 5.5 contains
four dotted arcs, each of which pass through a single node and visually separate the
clause above that node from the clause below it. Each arc is labelled with values of
tamt/neg or tama and the node through which the arc passes is the node to which
those features attach; everything below that node will inherit them by percolation.26
So, the tama value of the matrix clause is tama:future. It does not percolate into the
lower clause, because the lower clause attaches higher up than the node to which
tama:future attaches. The tama value of the lower clause is tama:antecedent. All up,
words which are low enough in the matrix clause inﬂect for tama:future or tamt:
potential (depending as always on the morphomic shape of the stem), while words in
the embedded VP clause inﬂect for tama:antecedent and tamt:antecedent.
Turning to our next scenario, the embedded VP in (5.46) functions as a relative
clause inside a direct object DP which is a complement of V. Both the matrix and
embedded tama and tamt values are the same as in (5.45) above, but this time every
word in the embedded clause inﬂects for the matrix tama value, tama:future.

The relevant non-surface syntactic structure in (5.46) is shown in Figure 5.6 (for
simplicity, the word jingkarmaruthu is omitted). Because the embedded VP is
located low enough within the matrix clause this time, it inherits the tama:
future feature from the matrix clause. Words in the embedded VP clause inﬂect ﬁrst
for tama:antecedent or tamt:antecedent (which attach closer to the word’s terminal
node), and after that for tama:future. Notionally, it should be possible for words in the
lower clause to inﬂect also for tamt:potential which is inherited from the matrix
26
For the purposes of the discussion, I will assume that tama:antecedent attaches to VP, though it may
actually attach to VPª (}5.6.1). Nothing hinges on this assumption though.
5.7 Matrix clause tama in embedded VPs 121
clause, but this does not happen: only stems ending in a thematic could inﬂect for a
matrix tamt/neg value, but all stems in the lower clause will already be inﬂected for
their lower clause TC features, whose realizations do not end in th or j.
As mentioned in }5.4, adverbial embedded VPs always lie within a DP daughter of
V0
, making them low enough to inherit any matrix tam feature, for which they
inﬂect accordingly.
So far in this section the examples we have seen, although consistent with the
‘syntactic’ analysis of tama inﬂection, are also more or less consistent with a
‘diacritic’ analysis. The only DPs inside embedded VPs which we have seen inﬂecting
for matrix tama features are direct objects, and direct objects always inﬂect for tama
anyway. Perhaps tama inﬂection is just ‘greedy’: with the exception of DPs in subject
second predicates, any DP which usually inﬂects for local tama features will inﬂect
for all tama features. What would be surprising under such an account is a DP type
which never inﬂects for its local tama value, but which, when placed in an embedded
VP, does inﬂect for a matrix tama value. This is in fact what happens.

In (5.48) a directly comparable DP occurs within a (surface-discontinuous) embed-
ded, direct object relative VP clause, which sits within a DP complement of
V. As before the case:ablative DP is in too high a position within its local clause to
inﬂect for the local tama value. However, because the embedded VP itself is low
enough within the matrix clause, that same DP inherits the matrix tama feature,
tama:instantiated.28
27
At this point we consider DPs whose mother node is a VP node, and ignore DPs embedded within
other DPs—for why DPs embedded in DPs are different, see }7.5.

Contrary to the evidence adduced in this section, Evans (1995a) claims at one point that DPs
‘which escape modal case in main clauses . . . also escape it in subordinate clauses despite the fact that the
modal case originates in a higher clause’ (1995a:113). As evidence, the sentence reproduced in (a) is
provided, the analysis being that the ﬁnal word of the embedded clause, rarungkuunth, fails to inﬂect for
matrix tama:instantiated (if it did so, it would appear as rarungkuruwurrk)—this, even though the
embedded verb does inﬂect for tama:instantiated (showing that the embedded clause inherits
tama:instantiated). Evans’ analysis is shown in (a), and a reanalysis in (b).

In (5.49) the embedded VP is a subject second predicate, within a DP daughter of S0
Æ
and so is too high in the syntactic tree to inherit matrix tama:future which attaches
to VPª. In addition, the demoted inanimate subject of the passive embedded clause,
kamarrkarra, is the daughter of VP so is too high to receive its local tama feature,
tama:continuous, which attaches to VP.29
To close this section, we turn to a claim in Evans (1995a:484–5), that embedded
VPs may contain subject second predicate DPs even though they never contain
subjects. If true, this would be syntactically rather interesting, given that evidence
from main clauses suggests that subjects and subject second predicate DPs are
sisters. In assessing Evans’ claim it will be important to keep in mind the distinction
between second predicates which are normal DPs (and which are our main point of
interest) and clausal second predicates which are VP constituents embedded in
an otherwise-empty DP. The question is whether embedded VPs (which might or
might not be clausal second predicates) can contain within them subject second
predicate DPs. Equipped with the understanding of tama inﬂection developed above,
it will be possible to formulate an argument that embedded VPs in fact cannot
contain subject second predicates. We begin with (5.50) which is provided in Evans
(1995a:484–5) as evidence for the existence of nominal subject second predicates
inside embedded VPs.

29
Evans (1995a:473) analyses the sentence in (5.49) as mono-clausal, with the consequence which he
notes, that tama:future appears to pair quite uncharacteristically with tamt:progressive in a single clause.
Under the analysis provide here, which places the last two words in an embedded clause, the sentence obeys
the normal co-occurrence restrictions on tamt and tama values.
5.7 Matrix clause tama in embedded VPs 125
In (5.50) the verb wanjiinkiya is the head of an embedded, adnominal VP that
functions as a clausal second predicate on the matrix object. The tamt feature
associated with that embedded VP is tamt:progressive and its tama value (which
doesn’t appear overtly on any words) would be tama:continuous. The implicit
subject of the embedded VP is coreferential with the matrix object (which is the
matrix argument for which the VP supplies a second predicate). The nominals jaya
dukurdukuya ‘with wet feet’ and mirray ‘in comfort’ are second predicate DPs which
pertain to the semantic argument that is both the matrix object and the implicit
embedded subject. Both jaya dukurdukuya and mirray inﬂect for matrix tama:
instantiated and neither inﬂect for embedded tama:continuous. The syntactic ques-
tion then is whether jaya dukurdukuya and mirray are object second predicates in the
matrix clause or subject second predicates in the embedded VP. Either syntactic
analysis will derive the correct semantics because the matrix object and implicit
embedded subject are coreferential.
Evans (1995a:484–5) states that jaya dukurdukuya and mirray in (5.50) are subject
second predicates in the embedded VP but does not provide arguments. As a ﬁrst
step, let us conﬁrm that so long as our focus is on adnominal embedded VPs such as
in (5.50) the facts of inﬂection will fail to offer an answer to the syntactic question of
whether such second predicate DPs are inside or outside of the embedded VP.
Both jaya dukurdukuya ‘with wet feet’ and mirray inﬂect for matrix tama and not
for embedded tama. Consequently if they really are subject second predicates in the
embedded VP they must occupy a syntactic position higher than where embedded
tama attaches, equivalent to what is shown in Figure 5.8 as *DP2P:#S≡↑O (where the
subscript 2P:#S≡↑O stands for a second predicate ‘2P’ on an implicit embedded
subject ‘#S’ which is coreferential ‘≡’ with the matrix object ‘↑O’). Figure 5.8 also gives
the location within the matrix clause of a second predicate DP on a matrix object
(shown as DP2P:↑O) among several other things. The important point now is that due
to their positions in the syntax, a putative *DP2P:#S≡↑O and a DP2P:↑O will always
inﬂect identically. Consequently the facts of inﬂection will never require us to analyse
DPs like jaya dukurdukuya and mirray in (5.50) as Evans’ *DP2P:#S=↑O; rather we
could sufﬁce with DP2P:↑O, that is, a normal object second predicate DP in the matrix
clause.
In a similar fashion, nothing will compel us to recognize subject second predicate
DPs in embedded VPs at the top of the matrix clause. In Figure 5.8 *DP2P:#S≡↑S would
be Evans’ putative subject second predicate DP, located inside an embedded VP
which itself supplies a clausal second predicate for the matrix subject. Putative
*DP2P:#S≡↑S will always remain uninﬂected for both matrix tama and embedded
VP tama and thus it will always be inﬂectionally indistinct from a subject second
predicate DP in the main clause, shown as DP2P:↑O. Thus we see that in both kinds of
adnominal embedded VP (labelled VP-ADNOM in Figure 5.8) nothing prevents us
from analysing putative subject second predicate DPs inside embedded VPs as
126 The clause and VP
matrix clause second predicates. The argument from parsimony would be that since
matrix second predicate DPs are required anyhow, Evans’ subject second predicate
DPs in embedded VPs are superﬂuous and so should not be posited. There also exists
an empirical argument for that stance. To ﬁnd it we must turn away from adnominal
embedded VPs (VP-ADNOM) to adverbial embedded VPs, labelled VP-ADV in
Figure 5.8.
Adverbial embedded VPs are informative because they sit low enough in the
matrix clause to inherit matrix tama yet their implicit subjects are coreferential
with the matrix subject (}5.4.1). Thus a putative subject second predicate DP inside
VP-ADV would inherit and inﬂect for matrix tama; meanwhile it would supply
a second predicate for a semantic argument which is equal to the matrix subject.
In order to get the same semantic effect via a second predicate in the matrix clause,
we would need a matrix subject second predicate DP which due to its height in the
matrix tama

syntactic tree would not inherit matrix tama. This is crucial: our two, semantically
equivalent, second predicate DPs will be inﬂectionally distinct. The putative subject
second predicate DP inside VP-ADV will inﬂect for matrix tama while the matrix
subject second predicate DP will not. Sentences which decide the matter are thus
those of the kind in (5.51).

put-‹mid›-‹dirt›-fut-sej
‘I will go to put (food) in my belly.’ [R2005-jul21]
In (5.51) the verb wuyiijiringkuunth is the head of an embedded, adverbial ‘motion
purpose’ VP which is in the position shown as VP-ADV in Figure 5.8. That VP
inherits matrix tama:future as well as matrix +sej, both of which we see on its
head verb wuyiijiringkuunth. The second predicate DP bardakantha is a ‘body part as
locus of effect’ predicate meaning ‘belly’. It inﬂects for +sej but revealingly it has not
inherited and inﬂected for tama:future,30
indicating that it must sit high in the
matrix clause, and cannot possibly be inside the embedded VP. What is particularly
interesting is that semantically the second predicate DP bardakantha contributes
to the sense of the embedded clause, and not the matrix clause: the motion purpose
event is ‘put (food) in my belly’ and not merely ‘put (food) (on myself)’, and the main
clause event is ‘I will go’ and not ‘my belly will go’; nevertheless, the nominal second
predicate bardakantha sits in the matrix clause. I surmise that embedded VPs never
contain subject second predicates (at positions *DP2P:#S≡↑O and *DP2P:#S≡↑S in
Figure 5.8) just as they never contain subjects. This is true even when the semantics
of the embedded VP would seem to require a subject second predicate. Instead, such
predicates are always located syntactically in the matrix clause (in positions DP2P:↑O
and DP2P:↑S). Such an analysis is consistent with all of the data, and fortiﬁes the view
developed above in }5.4, that the range of DPs permitted in embedded VPs is highly
restricted.
30
There is nothing which would prevent tama:future being overtly realized on bardakantha if the word
were indeed associated with the feature.
128 The clause and VP
5.8 tama and predicate DPs in verbless clauses
Clauses which lack a verb and whose main predicate is a DP constituent exhibit non-
surface syntactic structures just like those we have encountered above. As in other
clauses tama features attach to their usual VP nodes and percolate down from there.
Whether or not a predicate DP inherits and inﬂects for tama follows from its
position in the non-surface syntax. The purpose of this section is not to provide a
comprehensive description of non-verbal predicate types, but to illustrate these basic
morphosyntactic facts. We begin with locational DP predicates.
As shown by Evans (1995a:315–16) and illustrated in (5.52) and (5.53), predicate DPs
that specify the location of the subject can inﬂect for tama. In the terminology of
Nordlinger and Sadler (2004) this is propositional nominal tam, and not independ-
ent nominal tam. That is, the temporal meaning conveyed by tama relates as always
to the event denoted by the clause, and not to the entity referred to by the predicate
DP, in which case (5.52) means ‘Maybe they will stay in this camp’, and never ‘Maybe
they are staying in this camp-to-be’.

‘That snake is near the base of the rock, about to go under it.’ [W1960]
In (5.52) and (5.53), the N heads of NP in the predicate DP are unremarkable nouns:
‘camp’ in (5.52) and ‘rock’ in (5.53), and the DPs inﬂect for tama:future and tama:
directed, which attach to VPª and VP respectively. On the basis of this evidence,
31
Evans (1995a:316.ex.9–12) documents a similar DP predicate marked with μloc-μall, and interprets
it as being inﬂected for case:allative. In (5.53) at least, the appearance of the incipient adverbial clause
jaanmariijir, inﬂected with matrix tamt:directed which always co-occurs with tama:directed (}4.3.3),
suggests that μloc-μall marks not case:allative but tama:directed.
5.8 tama and predicate DPs in verbless clauses 129
we can surmise that locational predicate DPs with plain nominal heads of NP take
VP as their mother node.
When the head of NP in a locational predicate DP has an inherently locational
meaning the situation is different. Kayardild has several classes of inherently loca-
tional nominals, including relational types such as marrwa- ‘nearby; near to’, walmu-
‘up high; on top of ’, and several paradigms based on terms for the four cardinal
compass points (Evans 1995a:206–27). When an inherently locational nominal
heads the NP in a predicate DP, the DP does not inﬂect for tama:instantiated
(which attaches to VP), as shown in (5.54), though it does inﬂect for tama:present
(which attaches to VPª) as shown in (5.55). From sentences such as these it can be
concluded that predicate DPs with an inherently locational N head of NP select VPª
as their mother node.

Other predicate DPs do not inﬂect for tama (Evans 1995a:313–20), and thus they
must sit higher than VP.
5.9 tama and VP internal topic DPs
We began the chapter with topicalized DPs in complementized clauses. These were
argued to be daughters of S00
based on the fact that they escape all inﬂection for +sej
and +comp. Topic DPs also occur in uncomplementized clauses, but only in clauses
whose associated tama value is tama:instantiated or tama:directed. This restriction
can be accounted for if we assume that topic DPs in uncomplementized clauses are
VP-internal, and speciﬁcally that they are daughters of VPª.
To begin with the empirical facts, Evans (1995a:110, 532) documents topic DPs in
uncomplementized, tama:instantiated clauses. The existence of topic DPs in un-
complementized, tama:directed clauses is a new observation, an example of which is
provided in (5.56) where the topic DP appears in bold.32
32
The corresponding untopicalized DP would be miburiri ngijinjir, inﬂected for tama:directed.

eye 1sg-poss smoke ‹enter›-‹dirt›
‘The smoke is getting in my eyes.’ [W1960]
The feature values tama:instantiated and tama:directed both attach to VP, and so a
topic DP which is the daughter of VPª will escape inﬂection for them. In doing so,
such topic DPs become inﬂectionally distinct from their untopicalized counterparts,
which are complements of V and thus do inﬂect for tama.
The situation is different in clauses with tama values other than instantiated or
directed. In these clauses, the tama feature attaches to VPª or to VP and thus a topic
DP under VPª would inﬂect for tama just like its untopicalized counterpart, and the
topicalized–untopicalized contrast would be morphologically neutralized. This pre-
diction matches the facts: topic DPs are not distinguishable in uncomplementized
clauses with tama values other than instantiated or directed. When speakers wish to
visibly topicalize a DP in the context of these tama values the clause must be
complementized (Evans 1995a:532) and the topic DP placed under S00
.
5.10 Summary
Chapter 5 began with the grounds for postulating four S category nodes and situating
topic, focus, and subject DPs as daughters beneath them. The existence of focus DPs
is a novel observation. Subtly different domains of the antagonistic features +sej and
+comp follow from their respective attachment to S0
Æ and S0
, and provide an
account for the inﬂectional differences between topic DPs versus focus DPs versus
other parts of the clause. All complementized clauses associate with a +comp feature,
and sejunct complementized clauses associate also with +sej. Certain DPs marked
with μloc were identiﬁed as focus DPs in otherwise empty clauses.
Kayardild’s two kinds of embedded clauses, S00
and VP, were discussed next. Novel
observations regarding embedded VPs included the existence of three adverbial VP
types, and of constraints that exist on the internal constituents of all embedded VPs,
which do not apply in main clauses associated with the same tam features. The
nature of the bottom of the clause was examined next. Conditions on multiple head
verbs refer to subjects and objects but not to body part second predicates. Kayardild’s
‘locational objects’ are complements of V which are distinct from direct objects but
share many of their syntactic behaviours including promotion to topic, focus, and to
passive subject.
The second half of the chapter focused on the region of the non-surface clause
built around the VP nodes, especially VP–VP. Depending on the speciﬁc value,
tama features attach to VP, VPª, or VP and percolate down from there. Depending
5.10 Summary 131
on their placement relative to these nodes, DPs, including DPs containing embedded
VPs, inherit those tama features or they do not. The placement of DPs depends by
default on the semantic/grammatical role of the DP, although in certain cases it can
be overridden and be determined instead by the N head of NP. The articulated VP
structure of the non-surface clause is present even in verbless clauses. Within all of
these structures, features percolate in a perfectly normal and unconstrained fashion,
even into subordinate clauses. Arguments were presented in }5.6.3 for why a syntactic
analysis of these facts is superior to a conceivable, ‘diacritic’ alternative.

order. The analysis of the DP adopted here is comparable to Evans’ (1995a) analysis of
the NP, shown in Figure 6.1, although it does not include Evans’ ﬁnal, modiﬁer
position.
The DP structure recognized here is shown in Figure 6.2. Both the D head and the
DP in [Spec DP] correspond to Evans’ determiner position. The Num head of the
NumP adjunct of NP corresponds to Evans’ number position, and the XP adjuncts to
N0
correspond to Evans’ qualiﬁer positions. The N head of NP corresponds to Evans’
head position. On S00
complements of N, see }5.3 above.

FIGURE 6.2 Structure of the DP
The chapter is organized as follows: }6.1 presents arguments for the existence of the
DP as a single constituent; }6.2 examines ﬁlled and unﬁlled structural positions
within DP; }6.3 reviews whether N heads ever take DP complements; }6.4 discusses
the status of pronouns; }6.5 examines the concord of case within DP; }6.6 examines
the concord of number within DP and NP; }6.7 mentions case values restricted to
certain embedded DP positions; and }6.8 examines the complexities surrounding
case:locative and its realizations.
6.1 Arguments for the existence of DP
Many Australian languages freely permit the juxtaposition of multiple, coreferential,
nominal constituents within the same clause (Blake 1987:92,106; Sadler and Nordlin-
ger 2006a) and this is also true of Kayardild (see Evans 1995a:250–1; and Chapter 7).
Given that such multiple, coreferential nominal constituents can be adjacent to one
another, one might question the need to posit a DP constituent at all. While the
argument that there is no evidence for DP (or NP) can be upheld for some Australian
languages (e.g. Kalkutungu, Blake 1979, 1983; Warlpiri, Hale 1981; Jiwarli, Austin
2001), this is not the case for Kayardild, in which clear evidence can be found for
DP from the ﬁxed interpretation of nominal words based upon their position within
the phrase (Evans 1995a:233–5; see also similar arguments with respect to Gooniyandi
in McGregor 1990; and Martuthunira in Dench 1995). Consider the two syntactic
collocations in Table 6.1, which are reliably interpreted along the lines indicated.
(Crucially here, possessive pronouns like niwanda are among the set of polyfunc-
tional nominal stems whose existence was mentioned in }4.5.8.)
The reliability of the interpretations in Table 6.1 stems from the fact that within a
DP, determiners are followed by numbers, which are followed by modiﬁers. The
possessive pronoun niwanda is a determiner in the ﬁrst DP of Table 6.1 but a
modiﬁer in the second. Likewise, the reliable interpretations in Table 6.2 stem from
the fact that modiﬁers precede a head.
Data as in Tables 6.1–6.2 support the conclusion that nominal words appear within
contiguous units, inside of which function is restricted according to relative linear
order. That is, a structural unit exists within which nominal words are organized, and
that unit is referred to here as the DP. Presumably too, although the language permits
the occurrence of adjacent, coreferential DPs, the default interpretation of a string of
adjacent nominal words in Kayardild is that they comprise a single DP if their
functions admit of that analysis.
Evans’ post-head, ‘modiﬁer’ position is signiﬁcantly different and so is omitted
from the DP under the analysis proposed here. The constituent which occupies this
134 The DP
putative position may function as a determiner, number, or a qualiﬁer.1
As such
the post-head modiﬁer position crucially fails to restrict the function of the
nominal word which ﬁlls it and thus could equally be analysed as an adjacent,
coreferential, juxtaposed DP—the assumption adopted here (see Chapter 7 for
more on juxtaposition).

Kayardild thus differs from languages like Gooniyandi (McGregor 1990) and Martuthunira (Dench
1995) in which a single, post-head position in a NP is functionally distinct from other positions, and so can
be argued to be part of the NP.
6.1 Arguments for the existence of DP 135
6.2 Filled and unﬁlled structural positions in DP
DPs regularly contain overt D, Num, and N heads. The following examples illustrate
DPs whose other positions are ﬁlled: (i) by DPs in [Spec, DP] position; and (ii) by
APs, DPs, and VPs in the NP-internal, N0
adjunct position.
The [Spec, DP] position can be ﬁlled by DPs which take the genitive case as shown
in (6.1) or the ablative as in (6.2).2,3
In examples the constituents of interest appear in
bold type, while relevant constituent structure is shown via brackets and subscripted
labels at the left edge.

Evans (1995a:210) reports that certain case:origin DPs can function as determiners (i.e. in present
terms, as [Spec DP]), but no examples are given and I have not been able to ﬁnd any in my corpus. Given
that a DP without an overt determiner can be interpreted as deﬁnite, it is possible that the kind of DP which
Evans refers to contains a DP adjunct to N0
inﬂected for case:origin, within a matrix DP which is
interpreted as deﬁnite.

The next set of examples illustrates cases where the head positions D, Num, and N in
DP fail to be overtly ﬁlled. Examples like (6.7), where neither the D nor the Num
position is ﬁlled, are common.
(6.7) No overt D or Num

good country 1-pl-sej ‹leave›-‹imm-sej›
‘We left the good country.’ [R2005-aug03]
When we turn to the N head of NP, the situation is not entirely parallel. For most
positions in DP, if the position goes unﬁlled, the interpretation is simply that the
speaker has chosen not to convey any meaning associated with that position.
4
Although compass locational nominals like bath- can also be used as determiners (Evans 1995a:209–10,
39), the DP bathu here is a modiﬁer, describing the sun rather than picking out one among several possible
‘sun’ referents. (It is not part of the embedded VP; if it were, it would inﬂect for a tama:continuous feature
associated with the embedded clause as well as the tama:future feature of the matrix clause.)
6.2 Filled and unﬁlled structural positions in DP 137
However, when the N head of NP is not overtly ﬁlled, the assumption is that the
meaning associated with its position is recoverable from context (cf arguments by
McGregor (1990:254–5) with respect to Gooniyandi; and for the importance of this
fact in DP apposition see Chapter 7). As Evans states, DPs lacking a ﬁlled N head of
NP only occur when ‘extralinguistic or discourse context makes reference clear’
(Evans 1995a:236). The highlighted DPs in (6.8) entirely lack an overt NP, while in
(6.9)–(6.11) the NP constituent is represented only by an adjunct to NP or N0
.

2sg big ‹take›
‘You take a big one (a sheaf of grass)!’ [R2007-may29]
A point to note in passing is that DPs lacking N heads are fully interpretable by the
grammatical system as a whole. Not only is their reference resolved by recourse to
context, making them referential just like other, comparable DPs with overt N heads,
but they also have a semantic/grammatical role. This in turn means that they can be
ﬁt into the non-surface syntax just like any other DP, by assuming the default
syntactic position that corresponds to their semantic/grammatical role (cf }5.6.2).
Thus, the DPs without N heads in (6.8) and (6.9) are subjects and consequently are
138 The DP
daughters of S0
a and so escape inﬂection for tama; the DPs without N heads in (6.10)
and (6.11) are direct objects and consequently they are complements of V. In (6.10),
where the clause is associated with tama:future the direct object DP inherits it and
inﬂects for it; in (6.11) where the tamt:imperative clause associates with no tama
value, the direct object DP remains uninﬂected for tama.
6.3 Putative DP complements of N
Evidence for the existence of DP complements of N is weak. There is one noun,
wungunduwungundu ‘thief ’, which would appear on semantic grounds to take a DP
complement. The noun wungunduwungundu descends historically from a redupli-
cation of the verb form wunginda, which was either a nominalization or a tamt:
progressive inﬂection of wungij- ‘steal’. Verbs inﬂected for tamt:progressive take
direct object complements inﬂected for tama:continuous which is realized by μobl,
and the complement of wungunduwungundu is also marked with μobl, as in (6.12).
(6.12) Dathina dangkaa wungunduwungundu wuraninj.
ʈat̪ina ʈaŋka-a wuŋuntu-wuŋuntu-a wuɻan-in̪t̪a-ø
that.t man-t ‹thiefNL-thiefNL›-t food-μobl-t
that man thief food-obl
‘That man is a thief of food.’ [W1960]
In the synchronic Kayardild inﬂectional system I take the DP wuraninj in (6.12) to be
inﬂected with case:oblique, as glossed. The remaining question is how wuraninj
relates syntactically to wungunduwungundu. Based on its inﬂection it could be a
complement of N, but could also be an adjunct to N0
. The semantics of the oblique
case offer no guidance, as the oblique is seldom used in Kayardild and has no
coherent meaning across its uses (Evans 1995a:148–9). Moreover, no other entity-
denoting nominal takes a semantic complement in the manner of wungunduwun-
gundu. Let us therefore turn to the evidence relating to predicate nominals.
Aside from wungunduwungundu all of the N-heads which arguably take
complements are predicate nominals. Evans (1995a:149) records one instance of
mulurra ‘jealous’ with what appears to be a case:oblique DP complement, though
here the μobl marking could equally be a realization of +sej in an embedded S00
complement clause (}5.3) whose verb is elided.
(6.13) Dathina dangkaa mulurra niwaninja makunth.
ʈat̪ina ʈaŋka-a mulur-a ɳi+paɲ-in̪t̪a-ø maku-in̪t̪a-ø

that man jealous 3sg-ø-obl|sej woman-obl|sej
‘That man is jealous of his wife.’ [E149.ex.4-51]
6.3 Putative DP complements of N 139
The predicative nominals mungurra ‘know’ and burdumbanyi ‘not know’ both co-
occur with DPs marked by μloc, as in (6.14) and (6.15).
(6.14) Nyingka mungurru ngijinji.
ɲiŋ+ka muŋuru-a ŋicu-iɲ+ki-a
2sg-t know-t 1sg-μposs-μloc-t
2sg know 1sg-ø-ins

1sg-t not know-t 3sg-μposs-μloc-t
1sg not know 3sg-ø-ins
‘I don’t know him/her.’ [E231.ex.5-118]
In }5.8 we saw evidence that the full, non-surface syntactic clausal spine is present
even in verbless clauses with predicate DPs. I analyse the ‘objects’ of mungurru
and burdumbanyi as complements of an unﬁlled V in such a structure. This
explains why they inﬂect for what appears to be tamt:instantiated in (6.14) and
(6.15), and why they can be topicalized and thus escape such marking in (6.16)
and (6.17):
(6.16) Niwanda kajakaja ngada mungurru.
ɳi+paɲ-ta kaca-kaca-ø ŋat̪-ta muŋuru-a

2sg-t not know-t many-t place-t
2sg not know many place
‘There are many places you don’t know.’ [E1984-5-07]
Evans (1995a:320) reports other case-marked complements of N but the DPs in
question can also be analysed either as normal DP adjuncts to VP nodes, such as
the case:proprietive ‘subject matter’ DP in (6.18), or as DP second predicates on
the subject, such as the case:associative ‘accompaniment’ DP in (6.19).

that billy full water-assoc
‘That billy-can is full of water.’ [E320.ex.9-35], interpretation: lit. ‘That billy is
full, having water in it.’
Commenting on the kinds of ‘objects’ which we have just considered, Evans (1995a:319,
fn5) observes that, ‘[s]emantically, and in their choice of case, these resemble direct
objects. But none of the usual syntactic tests for objecthood—behaviour in imperatives,
or ability to feed the passive or reciprocal—are possible.’ One test which can be applied
is topicalization, and as we saw in (6.16) and (6.17), the DPs concerned do act like
normal, clause-level direct objects. In sum, aside from the unique case of wungundu-
wungundu it appears that nouns in Kayardild do not take DP complements; moreover
the inﬂection of the ‘complement’ of wungunduwungundu is consistent with it being
located elsewhere in its matrix DP, for example as an adjunct to N0
. There is no positive
evidence that Kayardild N can take a complement DP.
6.4 Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns are analysed here as nominal words which can function as D, N,
or A heads. As a D head, a possessive or a plain personal pronoun functions as a
determiner, as illustrated in (6.20a,b).
(6.20) Possessive pronoun as D

3sg-μposs-t country-t 3sg-t man-t
3sg-poss country 3sg man

As an A head a possessive pronoun projects an AP adjunct to N0
which functions as a
modiﬁer of N as in (6.21).

two-t 3sg-μposs-t e.Br-t
two 3sg-poss elder brother
‘two of his elder brothers’ [E236]
Personal pronouns are arranged into paradigms distinguishing person, number, and
possession and one might at ﬁrst suppose that these are each morphosyntactic features,
6.4 Personal pronouns 141
in the technical sense used in this book. However, pronominal features play no role in
the syntax: there are no syntactic constructions that subcategorize for pronouns with
certain features, and nothing external to the pronoun agrees with those features.5
Accordingly, pronominal paradigms are analysed here as paradigms of stems and not
of morphosyntactically inﬂected forms. For the forms of pronominal stems, see }3.2.1.
Pronouns of course do inﬂect for true morphosyntactic features. In (6.22) for
example the (lexically) third singular possessive pronoun inﬂects for number:dual,
case:ablative, and tama:instantiated.

3sg-poss-du-‹abl›-ins MoBr in law-du-‹abl›-ins
‘by his two uncles’ [E480.ex.11-64]
6.5 Concord of case in DP
Case always exhibits concord within DP and accordingly case features are analysed
as attaching in the non-surface syntax to the DP node. A prima facie potential
exception to this relates to sets of identically case-marked, juxtaposed DPs (includ-
ing appositive DPs, conjoined DPs, and so forth). In Chapter 7 the hypothesis will be
considered that case might sometimes attach not to DPs but to a higher, ‘juxtapos-
itional phrase’ that dominates multiple, juxtaposed DPs in the non-surface syntax.
The evidence, however, will lead to its rejection.
6.6 Concord of number in either DP or NP
Empirical motivation for the NP node inside DP comes from number inﬂection. The
two number values, num:dual and num:plural, exhibit transparent concord either
within DP as shown in (6.23)–(6.24) or within NP as shown in (6.25)–(6.26).
(6.23) Concord of number:dual in DP

5
Evans (2003:221) suggests that the selection of (the equivalent of) +sej features in complementized
clauses could be viewed as ‘agreement in person’ between the clause as a whole and its subject. For
argument against such an interpretation see }9.1.3.

In DPs which contain a NumP adjunct to NP, overt inﬂection for number is only
ever attested within NP, as illustrated in (6.27)–(6.28). The Num head itself will not
inﬂect for number.6,7

The facts of number inﬂection can be analysed in terms of the optional attachment
of number to either DP or NP, in combination with normal assumptions regarding
feature percolation and the inviolable constraint stated in (6.29).
(6.29) Num—number constraint
A Num head may not be associated with a number feature.
According to this analysis, if a Num head is present in a DP as in (6.27) and (6.28),
then the only available attachment site for number is the lower NP node. If the
number feature attached any higher it would percolate down and become associated
with the Num head, in violation of (6.29). If a Num head is not present then either
attachment site is available, as reﬂected in (6.23)–(6.26).
6.7 case values only found in predicate or adnominal DPs
DPs may be embedded inside a matrix DP as an adjunct to N0. Following Evans
(1995a). I will refer to these embedded DPs as adnominal. Two inﬂectional charac-
teristics of adnominal DPs stand out. First, they inherit the same tama features as
their matrix DP. Second, they can inﬂect for certain values of case which are only
found otherwise on nominal predicate DPs in verbless clauses. Those case values are
shown in Table 6.3. For reason of space I will restrict comment to the origin and
utilitive case values.

144 The DP
The origin case is realized by μorig and has the phonological realization /waːɲ/.
On my analysis its uses all relate to two meanings. The ﬁrst is geographical or
ecological provenance/source as in mala-waan-da (sea-μorig-t) ‘from the sea’,
dan-maan-da (here-μorig-t) ‘from here’, Kungarra-waan-da (place name-μorig-
t) ‘from Kungarra’. The second is the means or circumstances under which some-
thing, usually food, is caught or obtained. These DPs can modify either the hunter or
the hunted, such as ngimi-waan-da (night-μorig-t) ‘caught/hunting at night’, jirndi-
waan-da (twig-μorig-t) ‘caught/ﬁshing with the use of poisonous twigs’, dingki-
waan-da (dinghy-μorig-t) ‘caught/hunting from a dinghy’. Evans (1995a:478) also
documents the origin case denoting demoted subjects of resultative clauses but since
the relevant examples are clauses refering to catching and hunting, the case:origin
DPs could also be construed as fulﬁlling its normal, means/circumstance use.8
The utilitive case can be used to denote temporal durations as in (6.30) or to denote
entities or times for which something will be used. All bar three examples in my
corpus are straightforwardly adnominal. Syntactically, they are embedded in either a
subject or direct object DP and they inﬂect for tama accordingly.

smoke-cont ‹stay›-prog one-util day-util
‘(The ﬁsh) sit in the smoke for one day.’ [R2005-jul08]
Example (6.31) is one of the problematic cases. In (6.31) ngimimarray cannot be an
adnominal modiﬁer of the subject, as it inﬂects for tama:instantiated which the subject
does not inherit, and it cannot be a modiﬁer of the direct object, because the clause is
intransitive and thus has no direct object. I have no account for (6.31) other than to
observe that ngimimarray might be a disﬂuency, intended for a second clause which the
speaker did not complete (such disﬂuencies do occur occasionally in Wurm’s corpus).

The one example where an interpretation along these lines is not immediately plausible is sentence (a).
Here I suggest that the construal is of the initiates being ‘caught’ by the sound of dancing (thura-) hence
being described as thurawaand. The DP thurawaand is juxtaposed to bilda (on which see }7.5).

Suggested interpretation: ‘They were deafened, caught by the thunder of dancing.’ [E158.ex.4-89 ‘They (the
initiates) were deafened by the noise.’]

‘They painted themselves up over a long period (?for the night), (and later)
everyone will watch the big dance.’ [W1960; this sentence up to ngimimarray
also appears as E162.ex.4-104]
Example (6.32), and a second sentence in Evans (1995a:362,ex.9-178) whose structure
is parallel, perhaps contains a non-adnominal case:utilitive DP, or perhaps the word
kuwanmarrana is an instrument purpose adverbial clause from which the head verb
has been elided. This is plausible given that the semantics of the main clause is one of
obtaining an instrument (cf }5.4.1).

2sg wood-assoc ‹come›-pst ﬁre stick-util-‹prior›
‘Have you brought wood for ﬁresticks?’ [W1960; E160.ex.4-98], perhaps
construed as ‘Have you brought wood, to (be) ﬁresticks?’
In the Kayardild corpus there are no examples in which a DP inﬂected for a strictly
adnominal case contains a further embedded DP, which is suggestive of there
being a limit on the depth of DP embedding in Kayardild, a matter which is taken
up in }9.3.
6.8 DPs with locative case
In most syntactic contexts, due to a conspiracy of two factors, DPs with locative case
turn out to be inﬂectionally indistinguishable from DPs with case:.9
The ﬁrst of the
two factors relates to the linear ordering of sufﬁxes. case features attach to DP nodes,
and usually to DP nodes subordinate to VP. This places those DPs below the nodes to
which tama, tamt, +neg, +sej, and +comp attach, and because syntactically lower-
attaching features are realized closer to a word’s lexical stem (}4.5.6), case sufﬁxes are
usually followed linearly by some other sufﬁx. This is where the the second factor,
related to morphotactics, comes into play. Case:locative is realized, if possible, by the
morphome μloc, but μloc is severely restricted in its permissible morphotactic
9
There are several DP types reported by Evans (1995a:334–8) as taking case:locative, for which I have
been unable to locate any evidence that they do not merely take case:. These are: (i) ‘locative of time’ DPs
(1995a:140), cf the more complex situation summarized in }5.6.2 (ii) ‘ambient cause’ DPs (1995a:140, where
the semantics of ex.4-22 suggests μloc should be analysed as +cmp on a focus DP); (iii) ‘manner’ DPs
(1995a:141); (iv) contrastive DPs (1995a:141); and (v) DPs of ‘adversely affected’ arguments (1995a:141).
146 The DP
environments (on which more below). If the realization of case:locative by μloc
would violate those restrictions then the μloc, and hence case:locative, simply goes
unrealized. The upshot is that case:locative and case: inﬂections often become
morphomically, and therefore phonologically, identical.
Returning to morphotactics: μloc can only appear directly before μabl, μall,
μobl, or t (}2.6.4). In addition, μabl and μall never appear at the beginning of
morphomic strings that realize inﬂectional features, and therefore any μloc which
realizes case:locative will need to appear directly before μobl or t. Before t, μloc is
realized phonologically as /+ki/. The morphomic string μloc-μobl (glossed μloc.
μobl) is realized by the suppletive, cumulative morph /+kurka/. Thus the only
possible overt realization of case:locative is within the word-ﬁnal strings μloc-t or
μloc.μobl-t, illustrated in (6.33a,b). Realizations such as those in (6.33c,d) for
example cannot and do not occur.
(6.33) a. malaya b. malawurrka
mala+ki-a mala+kurrk-a
sea-μloc-t sea-μloc.μobl-t
c. *sea-μloc-μprop-t d. *sea-μloc-μloc-t
Beyond this there is one more factor which serves to make overtly identiﬁable
case:locative DPs rare. In most circumstances where case:locative can be used in
Kayardild it is also possible to use case:. To appreciate this we need to examine
morphosyntactic contexts in which tama and sejunct10
both either have  values,
or have values that are realized by μobl.
Imperative clauses have  values for both tama and sejunct. As illustrated in
(6.34) imperative pronominal direct objects appear with either case:locative or
case: (Evans 1995a:109).
(6.34) a. Danatha ngijinji! b. Danatha ngad!

‹leave› 1sg-ø-loc ‹leave› 1sg
‘Leave me!’ [E109.ex.3-35]
Resultative clauses also take tama:. DPs denoting locations can take case:locative
(6.35)–(6.36) or case: (6.37) in imperative and resultative clauses.11
10
tamt and negation are irrelevant here, since the realization of case:locative does not end in
thematic th or j; and +comp is never realized by μobl.
11
Case: location DPs are daughters of VPb (cf Appendix B, }B.4.1); the case:locative DPs must be
below VPa (Appendix B, }B.1).

2-pl ‹go›-neg.imp ‹go north›-neg.imp bush ‹ascend›-neg.imp
‘Don’t you (all) go up north into the bush!’ [W1960]
Not all instances of locative case vary with  however. case:locative is obligatory on
locative modiﬁers inside an NP, and on certain arguments of three-place predicates.
An example of the former is shown in (6.38).
(6.38) Bilarrina dathina ngukuwa wurumanki,
pilari-c-ɳaŋ-ø ʈat̪ina ŋuku-a wuɻuman+ki-a
‹spill-j›-μneg-t that.t water-t billy-μloc-t
‹spill›-neg.imp that water billy-loc
‘Don’t spill that water in the billy can,’ [E139.ex.4-17]
Three-place predicates in Kayardild select from six possible case frames (Evans
1995a:334–8) of which case frames 1 and 6 contain a Case:locative argument. The
bold type ‘destination’ DPs in (6.39)–(6.40) occur in Evans’ case frame 1,12
the ‘theme’
DP in (6.41) is in case frame 6.
(6.39) Kaburrbaya wuuja wuranda karnaj!

coals-μloc-t ‹put-j›-t food-t ‹cook-j›-t
coals-loc ‹put› food ‹cook›
‘Put the food on the coals, cook it!’ [E335.ex.9-87]
12
At ﬁrst glance it is tempting to analyse wuuj- ‘put’ in (6.39)–(6.40) as a simple transitive verb, glossed
as ‘transfer’, which takes a locative adjunct like those illustrated in (6.35)–(6.37), but this would fail to
explain why the DPs in (6.39)–(6.40) take case:locative obligatorily, compared those in (6.35)–(6.37) for
which case:locative is optional.
148 The DP
(6.40) Yakuri wuujirrinda kaburrbay.
jakuɻi-a wuː-c-iriɲ-ta kapurpa+ki-a
ﬁsh-t ‹put-j›-μres-t coals-μloc-t

‘The ﬁsh is/was put on the ashes.’ [E476.ex.11-47]
(6.41) Marraaja dangkaa kurumbuy!
maraː-c-a ʈaŋka-a kuɻumpu+ki-a
‹show-j›-t man-t spear-μloc-t
‹show› man spear-loc
‘Show the man the spear!’ [E338.ex.9-101]
What these examples show is that in clauses where we expect the realization of
case:locative to be morphotactically possible, case:locative is indeed realized and
thus we need to distinguish case:locative from case: even though the two values
often become morphologically neutralized. Moreover, even though case:locative
varies freely with case: in many contexts there are some in which a DP must be
case:locative, and thus the two case values cannot merely be realizational variants of
one another.
In clauses where one or both of tama and sejunct are realized by μobl (and
neither by anything else), case:locative continues to appear obligatorily on locative
modiﬁers inside an NP, as shown in (6.42). I have no examples of three place
predicates in case frames 1 and 6, so cannot comment on them.
(6.42) Kunawuna bilarrinyarra ngukuntha wurumankurrk
kuna+kuna-ø pilari-c+ɲara-ø ŋuku-in̪t̪a-ø wuɻuman+kurka-ø

‹child› ‹spill›-appr water-emo billy-‹loc-emo›
‘The kid might spill the water (that is) in the billy.’ [E139.ex.4-18]
In clauses like this, where tama and/or sejunct are realized by μobl, other instances
of case:locative appear to be rare. A single example is attested, shown in (6.43). In
this example the case:locative feature appears on a non-human demoted subject.

pandanus fruit knife-‹loc-emo› sing-mid-prog
‘Pandanus fruit is cut with a shell-knife.’ [E473.ex.11-33]
In my corpus all of the location-denoting DPs appear in case: as in (6.44); however
because the corpus of relevant clauses is small, it is not possible to gauge whether the lack
of case:locative equivalents to (6.44) is accidental or due to some grammatical factor.
6.8 DPs with locative case 149
(6.44) Kurthurra daraanyarra ngambunth.

shin-t break-‹μmid-j›-μappr-t well-μobl-t
shin break-‹mid›-appr well-emo
‘You might break your leg in the well.’ [W1960]
Overall, so long as morphotactic conditions permit, case:locative DPs can occur
distinct from case: DPs. In many such contexts, but not in all of them, case:
functions as an optional alternative to case:locative.
6.9 Summary
The chapter opened in }6.1 with arguments for the existence of the Kayardild DP as a
single consituent, and then ﬁlled and unﬁlled positions inside the DP were examined
in }6.2. As part of this it was argued that Evans’ (1995a) ﬁnal, ‘modiﬁer’ position is not
part of the Kayardild DP, and in }6.3 I argued that Kayardild N does not take DP
complements. In }}6.4–6 I surveyed personal pronouns, the attachment of case to
the DP node and of number to DP or NP, regulated in part by a constraint that
blocks number features on Num heads. Case values that only attach to predicative
and embedded DPs were identiﬁed in }6.7. Finally }6.8 probed the complex matter
of case:locative. Evidence shows that despite its realizational neutralization with
case: under a majority of morphosyntactic conditions, case:locative is distinct
nonetheless and will appear overtly when favourable circumstances permit.

DP juxtaposition
This chapter examines the empirical nature of DP juxtaposition in Kayardild, and
provides an analysis of it within the formal account of Kayardild inﬂection developed
so far in preceding chapters. We can begin with a rough working deﬁnition of
juxtaposition, in (7.1).
(7.1) Juxtaposition (ﬁrst preliminary deﬁnition; to be revised below)
The co-occurrence within the clause of multiple DPs which share the same
inﬂectional features, and some commonality in their semantic/grammatical
role.
An initial example of juxtaposition is given in (7.2), in which the juxtaposed DPs
are shown in bold type (the polylexemic DP is also bracketed). The two DPs share
the same morphosyntactic features, they are coreferential, and both are direct
object DPs.

much-ins food-ins 3-pl ‹dig up› lily-ins
‘They dug up a lot of food, lily roots.’ [E251.ex.6-36]
The chapter is structured as follows. An overview of the functions of juxtaposition is
presented in }7.1, leading to a revision of the working deﬁnition in (7.1). In }7.2
following a consideration of the relationship of juxtaposition to number, a second
revision is made. The relationship of juxtaposition to passivization, topicalization,
and focalization is discussed in }7.3, and then in }7.4 the question is posed, whether
the sharing of features across juxtaposed DPs might be due to a single ‘juxtapositional
phrase’ in the non-surface syntax, to which the answer is negative. In }7.5 juxtapos-
ition is employed as a tool for investigating the syntax of DPs with unﬁlled N heads of
NP and in }7.6 the ﬁndings of the foregoing sections are applied to the analysis of
case:privative marking of narrow scope negation. Finally, }7.7 compares juxtapos-
ition with secondary predication.
7.1 Functions of DP juxtaposition
Juxtaposition is used to several functional ends in Kayardild, most of which will be
introduced in this section; a small, additional set is discussed in }}7.5–7.6. As an
organizational device the examples below are grouped according to the degree of
overlap in the reference of the juxtaposed DPs. Captions to the examples indicate the
function of juxtaposition being illustrated and provide cross-references to discussion
in Evans (1995a).
In (7.3)–(7.4) the juxtaposed DPs each have separate, though coordinated, referents.

In (7.5)–(7.10) there is a partial or full overlap in the reference of the two DPs, by
virtue of one being a sub-part of, or the constituent substance of, the other. As in
other cases of Kayardild juxtaposition, there is no absolute constraint on the order of
juxtaposed DPs, even when the semantic relationship between them is asymmetrical,
as in ‘A is a part of B’.1

nonsingular pronoun is common in Australian languages (Singer 2001).

I have only been able to locate juxtapositions of malbaa birrka in combination with the verb burldij- ‘make

the general pattern of juxtaposition, the word order in these idioms is ﬁxed and the
two DPs are always adjacent.

At this point our working deﬁnition of juxtaposition can be updated to reﬂect the fact
that we have seen, that juxtaposed DPs are either coreferential (partially or fully)4
or
coordinated, and that they share the same semantic/grammatical role. A revised
deﬁnition will be shown below, after the status of number has been considered.
7.2 Juxtaposition and number
Juxtaposed DPs do not necessarily agree in number. Examples are shown in (7.15)
and (7.16).

Incorporating the update at the end of }7.1, a revised deﬁnition of juxtaposition could
be formulated as in (7.17):
4
Coreference will need to be viewed in a culturally appropriate manner, in which for example a turtle
and its egg are related as whole and part. Given that reference is a matter of discourse pragmatics, a degree
of cultural speciﬁcity such as this is not unexpected.
7.2 Juxtaposition and number 155
(7.17) Juxtaposition (second preliminary deﬁnition; to be revised below)
The co-occurrence within the clause of multiple DPs which (i) share the same
inﬂectional features other than number, (ii) are coreferential (partially or
fully) or coordinated, and (iii) share the same semantic/grammatical role.
7.3 Grammatical role alternations
Thus far we have seen juxtaposed DPs exhibiting identical inﬂection and sharing the
same semantic/grammatical roles. When juxtaposed DPs undergo alternations in
their grammatical role, that is, when they are topicalized, focalized, or promoted to
subject in a passive clause, they also act in tandem.
Example (10.34) illustrates the focalization of three juxtaposed DPs [wankuya]
[dathinkiya] [riinkiya] ‘a shark there coming from the east’. Example (7.18) illustrates
the (VP-internal) topicalization of three juxtaposed DPs,5
and (7.19) shows three
juxtaposed DPs all promoted to subject in a passive clause.

A tamt:immediate clause such as that in (7.18) is always associated with tama:instantiated, which all
three DPs would inﬂect for if they were not topicalized. The DPs yakurimarra ‘for ﬁsh’ and ngakuluwan-
marr ‘for us’ each have the relatively common structure for juxtaposed DPs, of a case-inﬂected DP (in this
instance case:utilitive) embedded in another DP (in this instance, a topic DP), on which see further }7.5
below.
156 DP juxtaposition
7.4 Juxtaposed DPs do not constitute a domain of concord
The existence of sets of DPs that share a similar function and identical morphosyn-
tactic features raises the question of whether there is some top-down principle which
ensures that similarly functioning DPs are inﬂected identically, or instead whether
the identity in the inﬂections is merely an epiphenomenal reﬂection of the fact that
each DP has acquired identical features independently of the others, by virtue of its
function. Within the framework being used here, the former view would be oper-
ationalized by positing something like a ‘juxtapositional phrase’ (JP) in the non-
surface syntax, which would dominate all DPs with similar function; features would
attach directly to the JP node and from there would percolate down to the DPs below,
thereby ensuring that they were inﬂected similarly. The latter view would reject the
existence of such a JP.
The question can be settled on empirical grounds. We began the chapter with a
prelimary proposal that juxtaposed DPs share features and functions, but it is not the
case that DPs always share their morphosyntactic features just because they are co-
referential/coordinated and share the same semantic/grammatical role. There are two
reasons for this. In }5.6.2 we saw that there exist certain lexical classes of nominals
which, if they occupy the head N position in NP, will override the DP’s semantic/
grammatical role (i) as the determinant of the DP’s mother VP node, thereby
affecting what tama values it can inherit, and (ii) as the determinant of DP’s case.
Also, some semantic/grammatical DP types exhibit variability in which syntactic
mother node they take, again affecting the tama features they end up inheriting.
Thus, if it were true that juxtaposed DPs had uniform features forced upon them by a
top-down process, then these idiosyncrasies are precisely what we would expect to be
overridden by the force of juxtaposition, whenever two or more DPs are coreferen-
tial/coordinated and share the same semantic/grammatical role. But this is not what
occurs.
In (7.20) the DPs danda and nathay are coreferential and share the same
semantic/grammatical role, yet their tama values differ. The reason is that both
danda and nathay are location DPs which can take as their mother node either VPb
or VPg (}5.6.2), and in (7.20) danda is a daughter of VPg while nathay is a daughter of
VPb. Since the tama feature in (7.20) is tama:instantiated, and attaches to VPb,
nathay inherits tama, but danda does not.6
No top-down principle has forced the
two DPs to acquire the same tama feature.
6
To be clear, the lack of inﬂection on danda in (7.20) is grounded in syntax, not in any idiosyncratic
inability of the root /ʈan/ ‘here’ to inﬂect, either for the morphosyntactic feature tama:instantiated or with
the sufﬁx μloc, as seen in (a):

In (7.21) ngumbanjina thabujuna and Wilikarr are coreferential and share the same
semantic/grammatical role, yet their case values differ. The DP Wilikarr is based on
a proper noun stem and takes genitive case to express possession (in the sense of
being the composer of a song). The DP ngumbanjina thabujuna is based on pro-
nominal and common noun stems and therefore takes case:ablative. Again, no top-
down principle has forced the two DPs to acquire the same case feature.

Given the evidence against its existence, no special mechanism will be posited here that
forces juxtaposed DPs into acquiring identical features. When juxtaposed DPs do
acquire identical features, they do so independently of one another. A ﬁnal deﬁnition
of juxtaposition can now be given in (7.22), from which any direct reference to
morphosyntactic features has been removed. Juxtaposed DPs, if they do share features,
do so only indirectly as a result of normal principles of Kayardild morphosyntax.
(7.22) Juxtaposition (ﬁnal deﬁnition)
The co-occurrence within the clause of multiple DPs which (i) are co-
referential (partially or fully) or coordinated, and (iii) share the same
semantic/grammatical role.
7.5 The syntax of DPs that lack N heads of NP
We have established that there is no need to posit any special principle or syntactic
phrase type in order to account for the inﬂection of juxtaposed DPs; rather the
inﬂectional facts of juxtaposed DPs follow from the same principles as adduced in
earlier chapters. As a consequence we are now in a position to apply that knowledge
and probe the syntactic nature of DPs lacking N heads of NP, by examining them in
environments where they are juxtaposed to other DPs. In doing so we will encounter
the reasons, cited originally in Chapter 5, for supposing the embedded VPs are
situated inside a DP.
To begin the task, we can reiterate from Chapter 6 that DPs in Kayardild do not
need to contain a ﬁlled head N position in NP. DPs without N heads are fully
158 DP juxtaposition
interpretable by the grammatical system; they have reference and a semantic/gram-
matical role and in light of the latter they are assignable to a predictable position in
the non-surface syntactic tree (cf }5.6.2) which will determine the tama features they
inherit.
The following examples introduce the functions of juxtaposed DPs which lack
N heads. In (7.23)–(7.24) a DP which lacks an N head of NP serves to modify another
juxtaposed DP whose N head position is ﬁlled.

In the translations of (7.23)–(7.25) an emphasis has been placed on the word
corresponding to the DP without N. Evans (1995a:249–50) documents that these
DPs contribute meanings which are either restrictive (narrowing down one of
multiple possible referents) or contrastive (picking out an attribute in contrast to
other possible attributes). Furthermore, in terms of surface syntax the DP without a
head N is always separated by a verb from its juxtaposed counterpart.7
Evans analyses
such cases, which I take to be two juxtaposed DPs, as ‘split NPs’, that is, as single,
7
One wonders whether the true generalization might be that they are separated by any constituent.
Although I have searched at some length for an example in which the separating constituent is something
other than a verb, I have not found one.
7.5 The syntax of DPs that lack N heads of NP 159
discontinuous constituents (1995a:249–50). There are two reasons to reject the ‘split’
analysis. The ﬁrst is an argument from economy: (i) there is no evidence that any
other discontinuous NP/DP constituents exist in Kayardild; (ii) there is ample
evidence that juxtaposed DPs exist; and (iii) there is ample evidence that juxtapos-
ition is associated with speciﬁc semantic effects, and thus it is unnecessary to posit a
‘split NP/DP’ just for this one case. The second and perhaps more compelling
argument is empirical. Here, examples can be found which contain the same kind
of DP (without ﬁlled N) with the same semantic functions but which can’t be
analysed as split NP/DPs because the the material in the DP without N is repeated
in the juxtaposed DP, as in (7.26) below.

Having found grounds to reject the ‘split NP/DP’ analysis of juxtaposed DPs with
unﬁlled N heads, let us now consider precisely what the internal syntactic structure of
those DPs is.
Beginning with the position of the DP in relation to the overall clause structure, we
can observe that in all of the sentences (7.23)–(7.26) the tama inﬂections of the
juxtaposed DPs in question correspond precisely to what we expect if the DP were ﬁt
into the clause based simply on its semantic/grammatical role: the direct object DPs,
which are daughters of V0
, show inﬂection for tama, while the subject DPs, which are
daughters of S0
a, do not. Turning next to the semantic behaviour of juxtaposed DPs
that lack an N head, we ﬁnd the following. In (7.23) and in (7.26) the lone word in the
juxtaposed DP in question is an A head. That A head functions as a modiﬁer, a
behaviour consistent with it occupying an AP adjunct to N0
, as shown in Figure 7.1. In
(7.24), the juxtaposed DP in question contained just the Num head kiyarrngku ‘two’,
with a semantic function corresponding to the syntactic conﬁguration shown in
Figure 7.2. In (7.25) the DP in question contained the demonstrative dathinku.
Demonstratives can function as D heads or as N heads. Dathinku in the former
function would translate as ‘that’, and in the latter as ‘there’. The dathinku in (7.25)
functions as a determiner ‘that’, and thus corresponds semantically to the syntactic
structure in Figure 7.3.
160 DP juxtaposition
We have no reason to believe that Figures 7.1–7.3 are anything but the correct
syntactic structures for the juxtaposed DPs we have been discussing. What is perhaps
most interesting about those syntactic structures, however, is the prediction that they
lead to: that additional juxtaposed DPs lacking N ought to be attested containing
constituents which are not represented in Figures 7.1–7.3, that is, containing DP in

we can begin with DPs in [Spec, DP].
In (7.27), embedded DPLOW jungarrbanabaya dangkanabaya ‘the adults’ appears
inside a matrix DPHIGH in its [Spec DP] position, and determines the juxtaposed DP
wuranki ‘food’. By doing so it induces the deﬁnite interpretation ‘the adults’ food’, as
opposed to the indeﬁnite ‘food from the adults’.

The syntactic embedding of DPLOW within DPHIGH in (7.27) in shown in Figure 7.4.
At this point, one might question whether such a complicated DP structure as
Figure 7.4 is justiﬁed, when it seems simpler just to posit one DP (the DPLOW)
without an extraneous, otherwise-empty matrix DP above it. In fact though, both
semantic and inﬂectional considerations point towards an analysis along the lines of
Figure 7.4. We can approach this issue by considering what the contrast would be,
between a DP like Figure 7.4 and an unembedded case:ablative DP. Semantically, the
interpretation of the embedded DPLOW in the former would follow both from the
case of DPLOW and the position of DPLOW in DPHIGH; in the latter, the semantics
would follow from case alone. Inﬂectionally, DPLOW in the former should inherit
tama according to the syntactic mother node selected by DPHIGH, on the basis of the
semantic/grammatical role of DPHIGH; in the latter the DP would inherit tama
according to its own syntactic mother node which it would select directly. The key

‘We heard the story from the old people.’ [E143.ex.4–35; 605, line.35]; Alternative
interpretation, in appropriate context: ‘We heard the story from old people.’
In (7.28), unlike (7.27), the ‘old people’ need not be interpreted as deﬁnite, because
jungarrana dangkana is not a determiner—it cannot be, because it is not embedded
in another DP. Also in (7.28), and unlike (7.27), the case:ablative DP jungarrana
dangkana selects its own mother node. case:ablative DPs, when they select their own
mother node select VPd (cf }5.6.2 and Appendix B, }B.7.2). This situates them higher
than VPb and hence unable to inherit tama:instantiated which attaches to VPb. In
(7.28), jungarrana dangkana does not inﬂect for tama:instantiated. Turning back to
(7.27), we see that the interpretation of DPLOW jungarrbanabaya dangkanabaya as a
determiner depends not only on its ablative case, but on the fact that it occupies
[Spec DP] in DPHIGH, and the fact that it inﬂects for tama:instantiated follows from
the fact that the matrix DPHIGH is a direct object DP, and thus low enough in the
clause to inherit tama:instantiated. In short, the syntactic analysis in Figure 7.4 is
supported by semantics and facts of inﬂection.
Next we move to DP adjuncts to N0
. As was the case for embedded DPLOW’s in the
[Spec DP] position, a DPLOW adjunct to N0
will have its own case feature, and the
overall position of its matrix DPHIGH in the non-surface syntactic tree is determined
by the role of DPHIGH (irrespective of the case or role of DPLOW). That this is so can
be seen in the comparison of (7.29) and (7.30). DPLOW takes case:origin in both
instances, but in (7.29) DPHIGH is a subject and so escapes inﬂection for tama (which
would be tama:instantiated); in (7.30) DPHIGH is a direct object and so it inherits and
inﬂects for tama:future.

There is ample cause to analyse the relative clause in (7.31) as an embedded VP
adjunct to N0
. We have now seen juxtaposed XP modiﬁers of several different kinds,
all of which have the syntactic form of an XP adjunct to N0
, embedded in a DP that
lacks a head N and is juxtaposed to the DP to which it relates. The argument from
parsimony would be that the VP relative clause in (7.31) is another instance of the
same general structure. Moreover in }5.7 we saw an independent reason for analysing
VP relative clauses as internal constituents of DPs: namely by doing so we predict
them to inherit matrix tam features in a manner parallel to DPs, so that embedded
VPs that modify subjects inherit features parallel to subjects (as they do) and VPs
that modify objects inherit features parallel to objects (as they also do). The two
sources of evidence converge neatly.
7.6 Narrow scope negation
The morphomic privative sufﬁx μpriv is used to mark narrow-scope negation and in
doing so it appears not to exhibit concord in DP. Although cases certainly exist where
μpriv occurs on all words in the DP, as in (7.32) and (7.34) below, it is also possible to
ﬁnd μpriv on just a determiner (7.33), just a number (7.35), just a modiﬁer (7.36), or on
just the head N (7.37). Where appropriate in the examples I have marked the apparent
DP constituent as [

The interpretation of these facts in Evans (1995a) is that ‘the privative need not
display full phrasal concord when functioning as a negator; instead, the domain of
166 DP juxtaposition
case marking depends on the logical scope of negation’ (1995a:159). While I agree that
the domain of case marking does depend on logical scope, it need not follow that
the normal principles of case concord are suspended. Rather than posit a non-
concordial domain of case:privative inﬂection, it is possible to assume that a special
mapping holds between logical scope and the syntax, such that the words under the
scope of negation are placed in their own DP, to which case:privative attaches and
which is then juxtaposed with another one or more DPs containing the out-of-scope
words, which are not inﬂected for case:privative. That is the analysis adopted here. It
would apply, for example to (7.35) above, as shown in (7.38).

7.7 Juxtaposition and second predicates
In terms of their inﬂection and their non-surface syntax, second predicates on the
subject and the direct object are just like juxtaposed subject and object DPs. Body
part second predicates were discussed in Chapter 5 (e.g. example (5.13)), which inﬂect
like a normal DP and which contain an overt N head of NP. Other second predicates
can be found which lack N heads. All can be analysed as DPs. The simple nominal
second predicates in (7.39) and (7.40) can be analysed with an internal syntax parallel
to that shown in Figure 7.1 earlier, that is, they are A heads in AP adjuncts to N0
in
otherwise-empty DPs.

7.8 Summary
This chapter began with a survey of the functions of juxtaposition in Kayardild in
}7.1. At that point the DPs which collocated with one another in order to fulﬁl such
functions shared identical inﬂectional features. In }7.2–}7.4 a range of cases were
considered in which the same functions resulted even when the DPs’ inﬂectional
features differed, leading us to reject an analysis in which the sharing of features is
due to the presence of a ‘juxtapositional phrase’ node in the non-surface syntax, from
which the common features would all percolate. Instead, the sharing of features arises
epiphenomenally as an indirect consequence of shared semantic and grammatical
characteristics. Crucially, these shared characteristics on their own are not sufﬁcient
to guarantee shared inﬂection in every instance, because under deﬁnable conditions
their effect on inﬂection is overridden, leading predictably to the discrepancies that
were observed.
In the second half of the chapter beginning with }7.5, juxtaposition was employed
as a tool for interpreting the syntactic structure of DPs lacking a head N of NP. This
enabled the existence of a range of syntactic structures to be conﬁrmed, whose
validity had been assumed in earlier chapters but not yet demonstrated. The logic
was extended to narrow scope negation in }7.6 and second predicates in }7.7. Taking
a broader view, an insight into the nature of DP juxtaposition in Kayardild leads to a
highly uniﬁed analysis of attested syntactic structures in the language, pivoting
around the fact that a large number of structural positions may be left unﬁlled.
The counterpoint to this is that the facts of inﬂection, driven by feature attachment
and downwards percolation, are blind to whether terminal nodes are ﬁlled or not,
and therefore remain fully commensurate across a broad range of superﬁcially rather
different structures.

Feature percolation
This chapter sets out in more detail the nature of feature percolation, the mechanism
proposed in }4.5.4 to regulate the transfer of morphosyntactic features from the non-
surface syntactic nodes to which they ﬁrst attach, down to the terminal nodes
corresponding to individual words. We begin with a discussion of Kayardild’s
realizational morphology, the component of the grammar that will have to interpret
the feature structures that percolation generates.
8.1 Considerations from the realizational morphology
A question that must be addressed by any theory that relates the syntax of a language
to its realizational morphology is how much if any of the linear ordering that appears
in the latter ought to be derived from the former and how much ought to be a matter
for the morphology alone. Without doubt some languages exist in which morpho-
logical order corresponds in a non-trivial manner to syntactic structure, and Kayar-
dild is among them. The basic empirical observation, that a parallel can often be
found between the linear order of features’ morphological realizations (from the
lexical stem outwards) and the relative embedding of the syntactic objects with which
the features are associated (from the terminal node upwards) is the core of Baker’s
(1985) Mirror Principle, Sadock’s (1991) Linearity Constraints, and Evans’ (1995a:107)
Concentric Scoping Principle which applies to Kayardild; it also ﬁgures in Ander-
son’s (1992:94ff ) Layering Principle, and falls out by default in Nordlinger’s (1998)
Constructive Case theory. On the other hand there is no shortage of languages in
which the relationship between the order of inﬂectional morphs and syntax is
tenuous at best and theories such as Paradigm Function Morphology (Stump 2001)
do not assume any ordering to be supplied by the syntax. Thus, although many
languages’ realizational morphology could be described in such a way as to relate
morphological order to syntactic structure, few of them must be. In the case of
Kayardild, though, there is no question: syntax will have to provide at least some
information about ordering to the realizational morphology, a point also made by
Sadler and Nordlinger (2006b). The argument runs as follows.
In the general case the relative order of the realization of two feature values in
Kayardild cannot be predicted on the basis of the identity of those values alone. The
two words in (8.1a,b) are inﬂected for exactly the same feature values yet the order is
contrastive. The reason is that the word forms in (8.1a,b) correspond to different
syntactic structures, summarized diagrammatically in Figure 8.1(a,b), which displays
the key syntactic nodes that are superordinate to the terminal, lexical node and the
attachment of morphosyntactic feature values to them.

Examples such as (8.1a,b) show that morphological order is contrastive, but they do
not yet prove that syntax absolutely must pass an ordered set of features to the
morphology. It might be proposed that the apparent ordering of features is transmit-
ted to the morphology by way of an ‘order-free, diacritic’ system. Suppose that
Kayardild possesses not one but two case features, case1 and case2, and not one
but two number features, num1 and num2, and likewise with all features that can be
contrastively ordered. The contrast in (8.1a,b) would be between the feature set
{case1:assoc, num2:pl} and {case1:assoc, num1:pl}. In the syntax we can say that ‘2’
features are higher than ‘1’ features, and in the realizational morphology we can say
that the linear order of features’ realization must be num1>case1>num2>case2. Such
an approach should succeed provided that the features it requires constitute a closed
class and in }9.3 I suggest that indeed there are tight, syntactically motivated limits
on embedding in Kayardild which would ensure this. Nevertheless, beyond its
bare technical feasibility there are questions over how coherently an ‘order-free
diacritic’ analysis could capture the nature of the system. Speciﬁcally, the diacritic
model would require rules to faithfully map hierarchical syntactic relationships
between feature values to the correct features (for example to case1 then case2 and
not vice-versa), and rules to faithfully map those features to ordered morphological
realizations. Signiﬁcantly, unless some consistent meaning were imputed to the

subscripts 1 and 2, these stipulations would need to be repeated independently for
each pair of features, and the fact that syntactic and morphological ordering align in
the same direction for each pair of features would be accidental. While it would be
possible to impute meaning to the subscripts 1 and 2, and thereby unify the stipula-
tions, doing so would involve an implicit reintroduction of ordering. A truly ‘order-
free diacritic’ implementation would lack coherence, and thus I will employ a system
which preserves ordering where needed, from the syntax via the morphosyntactic
representation to the morphological realization.
8.2 Contrastive ordering and antagonism
Notwithstanding the discussion above regarding ordering, the guiding assumption
made here is that the representation which is passed from the syntax to the realiza-
tional morphology is as minimal as possible. For that reason, information related to
syntactic hierarchy will be kept to a bare minimum, and a relatively large amount of
sufﬁx ordering will need to be determined by the realizational morphology on its
own. (An alternative account would place more of the information about syntactic
embedding into the representation generated by feature percolation, and thereby
lighten the load of the realizational component.) The realizational morphology itself
is formalized in Chapter 11.
In addition to keeping track of ordering, the representation generated by feature
percolation will need to convey which features potentially enter into antagonistic
relationships. Recall that tama stands in an antagonistic relationship to tamt and
neg, but only if the features involved correspond to the same clause. As we will see
shortly, it will be possible to deal with both ordering and antagonism in a single stroke.
The kinds of features for which multiple values can be contrastively ordered on
one Kayardild word are tama, tamt, and neg (attaching to VP nodes in two clauses,
one of which is embedded in the other) and case and number (attaching to DP or
NP nodes in two DPs, one of which is embedded in the other). All instances of
contrastive ordering will therefore involve either embedded VPs or embedded DPs.
Since we have already found good support for analysing all embedded VPs as
occurring inside a DP we can simplify this observation to (8.2).
(8.2) Observation regarding contrastively ordered values of a single feature:
Contrastive ordering of multiple values vi,vj of a single feature f, which attach
to nodes ni, nj, is found if and only if the hierarchical sequence of nodes from
ni to nj includes at least one DP node.
In addition, we can observe that all attested antagonistic relationships, listed in
Table 8.1, involve pairs of features that attach to pairs of nodes between which no
DP node occurs:
8.2 Contrastive ordering and antagonism 171
(8.3) Observation regarding antagonism:
Antagonism between multiple features fi, fj, which attach to nodes ni, nj, is
found if and only if the hierarchical sequence of nodes from ni to nj includes
no DP nodes.
In order to keep track of both contrastive ordering and antagonism, it will be
necessary and sufﬁcient to note whether a DP node appears in the hierarchy of
nodes between the attachment sites of two features.
8.3 Formal implementation
Feature percolation will be construed as a process which calculates an ordered
collection of (unordered) sets of feature values. These orderings will be written, for
example, as h{a,b}>{c,d,e}>{f,g}i, where a through g are feature values, and in which
the sets {a,b}, {c,d,e} and {f,g} are each internally unordered, but are ordered with
respect to one another. During feature percolation, one such collection, Ci, will be
calculated for every syntactic node ni in the syntactic tree. The collections associated
with terminal nodes are the ones which are passed to the realizational morphology.
Collections that are constructed during feature percolation are distinct from the sets
of features, Ai, which will have attached to a node ni before percolation begins. The
calculations themselves are deﬁned in an iterative fashion, so that Ci always depends
on Ai and on Ci-1, where Ci-1 is the collection associated with node ni-1, which is the
node immediately superordinate to node ni. In this way, information will ﬂow down
the syntactic tree, from the root node to the terminals.
The calculation of Ci for any node ni is shown in Table 8.2 (a–c), where {} is the
null set.
It will be assumed that for representations passed to the realizational morphology,
any ordering of a null set is vacuous, so that for example h{a,b}>{}i, h{}>{a,b}i,
and h{a,b}i are all equivalent.
8.4 Examples
Examples of feature percolation are provided below. In each example three main
pieces of information are displayed. In the centre is an abbreviated column of

syntactic nodes ending with the terminal node at the bottom and starting with its
highest superordinate node at the top. Generally, a node superordinate to the
terminal is listed only if its collection, Ci, differs from that of its own immediately
superordinate node. In such cases an indication is given of the set Ai of features that is
attached to the node in question, the collection Ci which is calculated for that node,
and the calculation operation that applies (a., b., or c. from Table 8.2).
Figures 8.2 and 8.3 show the application of feature percolation to the words
karndiwalanurru and karndirnurruwalad from (8.1) above. Percolation in
Figure 8.2 passes no ordering of number and case to the realizational morphology,
while the percolation in Figure 8.3 passes h{case:assoc} > {num:pl}i.

Discussion
Chapters 5–8 offered an analysis of Kayardild inﬂection in terms of three formal
notions: a non-surface syntactic structure; antagonism between certain features in
terms of their overt realization; and concord of features within predictable domains,
operationalized in terms of feature attachment followed by percolation through the
non-surface syntax. The purpose of this chapter is to compare that with alternative
analyses of Kayardild. Section 9.1 defends the position that the three formal notions
of Chapters 5–8 are sufﬁcient to account for the data by arguing against the need for
additional principles of agreement which have been proposed in the literature.
Section 9.2 emphasizes the parsimony of the present account of tama and tamt
inﬂection relative to the analysis in Evans (1995a). In }9.3 I consider the relationship
between syntactic recursion and inﬂection in Kayardild and conclude that there is no
convincing case for the claim (Evans 1995a; Evans and Levinson 2009) that morph-
ology constrains the syntax.
9.1 Sufﬁciency of the analysis
This section argues against claims that a formal analysis Kayardild inﬂection requires
as many as three additional agreement operations beyond concord.
9.1.1 Inﬂection of motion adverbs is not special
Kayardild possesses a closed class of motion adverbs (‘motion verbs’ in Evans 1995a).
Unlike other adverbs which exhibit free surface word order, motion adverbs always
appear in immediate post-verbal position. Of direct interest here is not the surface-
syntactic behaviour of motion adverbs but their inﬂectional behaviour, which on my
account is a matter of non-surface syntax. Six lexical stems function as motion
adverbs. The same six also function as main verbs with somewhat different meanings.
Table 9.1 lists the stems and their meanings as motion adverbs and main verbs,
following Evans (1995a:308–11).
Motion adverbs are analysed here as acquiring their inﬂectional features in the
same fashion as any other word, via feature percolation. Taking a contrary view,
Evans (2003) argues that the inﬂection of motion adverbs is not comparable to that of
other constituents, stating that unlike in other cases, ‘one cannot derive the choice of
[tamt and negation] inﬂection [on motion adverbs] directly from the clausal seman-
tics: the only plausible source is direct agreement with the head verb’ (Evans 2003:223).
The argument hinges on a semantic analysis of sentences like (9.1).
(9.1) Niya kuujuujarra thaatharr.
ɳi-a ku:cu:-c+ŋara-ø t̪a:-t̪+ŋara-ø
3sg-t ‹swim-j›-μ̋cons-t ‹‘return’-th›-μ̋cons-t
3sg ‹swim›-pst ‹‘return’›-pst
‘He went off for a swim.’ (Evans 2003:223,ex.10)
Evans observes that in a sentence like (9.1), ‘the swimming is clearly located in the
past, but the “returning” need not be (a narrator could go on, for example, to say that
the subject had, unexpectedly, yet to return)’ (2003:223). From this observation, the
conclusion is drawn that thaatharr is not (or not necessarily) a semantically ‘past
tense’ adverb, and consequently that its morphosyntactic past tamt inﬂection merely
repeats the tamt:past feature associated with the head verb. If I understand Evans
correctly, the crucial comparison is with a conceivable alternative, in pseudo-
Kayardild, where the ‘future’ meaning of thaath- is reﬂected faithfully in its tamt
inﬂection, so that thaath- would inﬂect not for tamt:past but for tamt:potential.
Two points can be raised in response to this. First, even if the premise regarding
the meaning of thaatharr is correct and it is per se a ‘future’ adverb, it does not
necessarily follow that thaatharr fails to acquire its tamt:past feature on the basis of
clause-level semantics—for the argument to go through, one would need to prove
that the compositional semantics of Kayardild yields something other than a past

178 Discussion
tense clause when confronted with a past tense head verb and a semantically ‘future
tense’ adverb.1
Secondly and more importantly, there is a compelling reason to
believe that thaatharr is not a ‘future tense’ adverb at all but a past tense adverb.
As Evans (1995a:308) documents, the stem form thaath- when used as an adverb
means not ‘return’ but ‘go and V, expecting to return’, and any argument regarding
the mechanism by which motion adverbs are inﬂected must be attentive to which
meaning is in play. In (9.1) thaath- is a motion adverb and thus the relevant semantic
fact is that the subject did ‘go and V, expecting to return’ in the past. Consequently
there is no cause to believe that the past tamt value of thaath- is anomalous or
special in (9.1), or more generally, that motion adverbs inﬂect according to any
principle other than those operating elsewhere in the clause.
9.1.2 ‘Referential case’ and ‘case linkage’ are unnecessary
Juxtaposed DPs in Kayardild typically inﬂect alike (Chapter 7). Subjects and their
second predicates always inﬂect alike, as do objects and their second predicates
(Chapter 5). Under the present analysis no special mechanism is required to account
for these facts. Instead the semantic/grammatical functions of the DPs cause them to
occupy identical structural positions in the non-surface syntax, as a consequence of
which concord, implemented in terms of feature percolation, causes the DPs to
inherit the same features as one another—independently and in parallel. An alterna-
tive, non-concordial analysis is that of ‘referential case’ (Austin 1981; Dench and
Evans 1988), which requires extra machinery.
The notion of referential case is applied to the analysis of juxtaposed DPs and second
predicates in Kayardild among other Australian languages in a seminal paper on case
stacking by Dench and Evans (1998), who state that it involves ‘the marking of some NP
or adverb in agreement with some other (usually core) NP in the same clause’ (1988:13).
The key characteristic of referentialcase for the present purposes is that the acquisition of
features by DPs is not always parallel and independent; rather some DPs acquire features
only dependently, subsequent to the acquisition of features by others.2
Using the
terminology ‘case linkage’ Evans (1995a:331) invokes what appears to be the same
mechanism to account for the inﬂection of second predicates in Kayardild, though no
deﬁnition is provided: ‘[I] assume that object complements are distinct constituents, and
that their agreement with the object is accounted for by case linkage’ Evans (1995a:331).
The present analysis of Kayardild does not require referential case or case linkage,
as the same effects follow automatically from concord and the placement of DPs in
1
An equivalent observation is made by Corbett (2006:140).

Arguments against the use of dependent mechanisms for the distributing of inﬂectional features as in
referential case have also been made by Sadler and Nordlinger (2006a) with respect to appositional,
part–whole, and asyndetic coordinating DP juxtaposition in Australian languages, and by Schulze-Berndt
and Himmelmann (2004) with respect to second predicates.
9.1 Sufﬁciency of the analysis 179
appropriate positions in the non-surface syntax. This is an interesting and encour-
aging result given that the impetus for proposing non-surface syntax in Kayardild
was not speciﬁcally to obviate the need for other mechanisms of feature-transfer, but
to simplify the description of concord.
9.1.3 Sejunct–nonsejunct is not person agreement
Here I supply counterarguments to suggestions in Evans (1995b:409, 2003:221) that
the opposition between sejunct and nonsejunct complementized clauses is a form of
agreement with the person value of the subject.
To recap }5.1, complementized clauses in Kayardild will be nonsejunct when the
subject is (i) ﬁrst person inclusive, or (ii) second person and the speaker wishes to
express solidarity with the addressee; and are sejunct otherwise. In nonsejunct clauses
all constituents other than topic DPs are associated with a feature +comp. In sejunct
clauses all constituents other than focus DPs and topic DPs are in addition associated
with +sej. On constituents associated with both +comp and +sej only +sej is overtly
realized due to feature antagonism. In Table 9.2 I lay out this arrangement as a
pairing of two systems. The speaker opts between system A and system B in order to
express solidarity with the addressee or not, though systems A and B are materially
distinct only when the subject is second person.
System A groups inclusives against all others, while system B groups second
persons and inclusives together in opposition to others. As far as I can ascertain
the syncretisms in system A do not appear elsewhere in the world’s languages as a
pattern of person/clusivity marking; the pattern is not mentioned for example in the
extensive survey of person system syncretisms by Seweirska (2004:75–81). Nor is
system B a natural or particularly common system: from a survey of clusivity-based
syncretisms Cysouw (2005) concludes that syncretism of the second person with
inclusives is just as common as with exclusives, and that neither is ‘natural’. In terms
of their internal oppositions then, there is nothing to suggest that either system A or
B is a system of person or clusivity marking in any typologically grounded sense.
The idiosyncrasy of the Kayardild sejunct–nonsejunct system extends also to the
basis of optionality between systems A and B. To appreciate this, consider the
signiﬁcantly different optionality found in number agreement between a verb and

180 Discussion
a semantically collective subject in some varieties of English, for example in ‘the
committee has agreed’ versus ‘the committee have agreed’. Corbett (2006:155–65)
refers to this phenomenon as semantic agreement and shows that it arises in cases
where two different construals of an agreement-triggering item motivate the usage of
different inﬂectional features. In the English case the word ‘committee’ can be
construed as congruent with its (singular) morphosyntactic form, or as plural.
Importantly, what is construed one way or another is whether ‘committee’ denotes
a unit or a multiple, and the inﬂectional feature which is affected is correspondingly
number (and not, for example, person). The purported link between Kayardild
sejunct–nonsejunct and person or clusivity is not at all parallel. That is, when the
speaker in Kayardild chooses system A or B, that choice conveys a construal of the
addressee not as ﬁrst person inclusive, or exclusive, or third person, but as someone
with whom the speaker expresses solidarity or not.
In sum, I am inclined to agree with Cysouw (2005:100), that if a typological
‘phenomenon is rare cross-linguistically, then the explanation should not invoke
universal characteristics’. Kayardild’s +sej system is not only rare but almost certainly
unique. It should be analysed not as person agreement but as a binary opposition
which idiosyncratically entangles aspects of person, clusivity and solidarity.
9.2 Parsimony of the analysis
The analysis of tam inﬂection presented in Chapters 4–9 is that each Kayardild clause is
associated with a set, TC, comprising two tam features (the thematic tamt and athematic
tama) and sometimes +neg. Some words in the Kayardild clause inherit and hence
inﬂect for none of the features in TC while others inherit them, and then may inﬂect for
either tama or tamt/neg. The disjunctive choice between tama on the one hand and
tamt/neg on the other is due to feature antagonism. Precisely which of tama or tamt/
neg gets realized is determined by the morphomic form of the stem to which the
inﬂection will attach. Stems ending morphomically in a thematic element (glossed th
and j) inﬂect for tamt/neg while others inﬂect for tama. In Chapter 2 I argued that
th and j are morphomic units which occur at the ends of lexical verbal stems, the ends of
thematic case sufﬁxes, and the end of markers for the incipient values of tama and tamt.
One potential concern with this analysis is circularity: have thematics been postulated
in a post hoc manner in just those places where they will lead to correct predictions about
inﬂection? The answer is no. The presence of thematics is detectable independently
through their phonological realization. In underlying phonological forms they appear
uniformly as /t̪/ and /c/. According to the regular phonological rules of Kayardild those
underlying segments may surface unchanged or may leave indirect phonological traces
of their presence, such as when the retroﬂex-initial negative sufﬁx /-ɳaŋ/ undergoes
deretroﬂexion in the derivations / . . . t̪+ɳaŋ/, / . . . c+ɳaŋ/ ! [ . . . naŋ . . . ]. The only
times th and j fail entirely to appear on the surface is in cases where they are expected
9.2 Parsimony of the analysis 181
on independent phonological grounds to be deleted without trace, such as when
followed by the /n/ realization of the ‘morphomic nominalizer’ sufﬁx μn, because in
Kayardild any underlying string /t̪+n/ or /c+n/ surfaces simply as [n] (Round 2009).
Another aspect of the present analysis is that single values of tamt may be realized by
multiple morphomic units, such as when tamt:nonveridical is realized by the morpho-
mic string μn-μpriv. Severaltamt values have multi-unit morphomicrealizations which
begin with μn. Diachronically these trace back to case-marked nominalizations of verbs,
but as I remarked in }2.6.8 much of the system which is ancestral to modern Kayardild
inﬂection has undergone ‘morphomicization’. Erstwhile verbal thematics have become
morphomic th and j; erstwhile case markers have become morphomic categories that
now realize case, tense/aspect/mood, and complementization; and erstwhile nominali-
zers and case have become morphomic categories which realize tamt values.
The analysis of Kayardild inﬂection in Evans (1995a) adopts what could be
characterized as a more historicizing view according to which tamt sufﬁxes always
attach to ‘morphologically verbal’ words, and thus thematically case-inﬂected nouns
must be regarded as ‘morphologically verbalized’;3
secondly the marker μn in tamt
sufﬁxes is taken to convert its stems to ‘morphological nominals’ in which case
certain tense-inﬂected verbs must be regarded as morphologically nominalized.4
In
the following sections I argue that this leads to an unnecessarily complex picture of
Kayardild inﬂection, characterized by an asymmetric combination of six tam fea-
tures (versus two on the analysis proposed here) and a complicated system of
inﬂectional selection which is forced to search inside a stem’s layered composition
in order to decide which feature should be inﬂected for.
9.2.1 Complexity of the feature set
Kayardild tam inﬂection is analysed in this book in terms of two features, tama and
tamt and every clause associates with one value of each. In Evans (1995a) six features are
used, if we count as ‘features’ the kinds of marking which fulﬁl the same function as my
tama and tamt. In a given clause either two or three are used, and which features are
used will vary from one clause type to another. The discrepancy between the two
analyses can be illustrated with the four short clauses in (9.2)–(9.5).5
3
I will not discuss the incipient tam markers in this section as Evans (1995a) does not analyse them as
distinct parts of the inﬂectional systems (cf }5.4.1).
4
Evans’ notion of word-class changing inﬂection is rather different from the notion in Distributed
Morphology according to which roots acquire their word class only by virtue of class-bestowing functional
heads in their syntactic environment (Harley and Noyer 1999; Embick 2000). For Evans, stems are
inherently classed and their class changes despite there being no alteration of the syntactic environment;
in DM stems are inherently classless and only change class when their environment changes.
5
For the purposes of providing paradigms of comparable examples, I deviate here from my usual
practice of citing only attested sentences. The tam features (9.2)-(9.5) can be found in attested sentences in
(7.37), (B.7), (4.13), and (5.32) respectively.
182 Discussion
In (9.2) my tamt corresponds to Evans’ tense and my tama to Evans’ modal
case. Evans’ (1995a) features are indicated in parentheses in the ﬁnal line of the gloss.

‘I sang a song.’
In (9.3) my tamt now corresponds to Evans’ inﬂectional nominalization, a
morphological operation which occurs across the same syntactic domain as tense
but which converts stems into ‘morphological nominals’ (more on which below). My
tama corresponds in (9.3) to Evans’ associating case, which occurs in conjunction
with ‘nominalized’ verbs of the type in (9.3), and which appears in addition to the
zero value of modal case (Evans 1995a:472, 483).

‘I am singing a song.’
The clause in (9.4) also contains an inﬂectionally nominalized verb on Evans’
account, but one which further inﬂects for what I will term ‘nominalization
case1’.6
Thus, here my tamt corresponds to a combination of inﬂectional nom-
inalization and nominalization case1. My tama corresponds to Evans’ modal
case once again, illustrating the fact that the associating case in (9.3) above only
co-occurs with inﬂectional nominalization if nominalization case1 is absent.

Evans does not assign any speciﬁc label to this kind of case, but nominalization case1 is not distributed
like any other kinds of case in Evans’ analysis (adnominal case, relational case, modal case, or comple-
mentizing case) so presumably should not be identiﬁed with any of them.
9.2 Parsimony of the analysis 183
Lastly in (9.5) my tamt again corresponds to inﬂectional nominalization and
nominalization case1, but this time my tama corresponds to yet another kind of
case. Evans does not give this case a speciﬁc name, but notes (1995:480) that it
displaces the modal case which appears in clauses like (9.2) and (9.4). Here I will call
it nominalization case2.

(nominalization case2)
‘I have sung a song.’
The sum of these differences is that Evans (1995a) employs three kinds of case where
I use tama, usually with one, but sometimes with two kinds per clause, and three
kinds of marking where I use tamt. The asymmetric co-occurrences of those features
is summarized in Table 9.3. The points I make here are simply that in terms of raw
numbers of features required, the analysis presented in the preceding chapters is
more parsimonious, and that it is more perspicuous insofar as it captures a twin
system of tam marking in terms of two consistent features, rather than six in various
permutations.
9.2.2 Complexity of conditioning
In contrast to the analysis proposed here, Evans (1995a) does not analyse Kayardild’s
thematics th and j as part of stems (}2.2.2) and therefore some other mechanism
must be employed to condition the appearance of the equivalents of tamt and tama
inﬂection. The mechanism employed is an abstract diacritic feature which Evans
(1995a, 2000, 2003) refers to as a stem’s ‘morphological word class’ (I substantiate my
claim that this feature is diacritic only in }9.2.3 below). This is different from a word’s
syntactic word class (Evans 1995a:89) which determines its syntactic behaviour. In

184 Discussion
this section I argue that Evans’ choice of diacritic analysis, which one might expect to
be benign, is compromised by a need to refer to the layered composition of a stem in
order to decide which feature it should inﬂect for.
Evans (2003) states that the equivalents of my tama are assigned to DPs, and that
the equivalents of my tamt are assigned either to verbs and thence by agreement to
other morphologically verbal words, or in parallel to all morphologically verbal
words. This account proceeds straightforwardly in cases such as (9.6). Glossing in
the next few examples follows Evans’ analysis (including vcase for verbalizing case;
nomzn for inﬂectional nominalization; nomzn case for nominalization case). The
morphological word class of stems is indicated by a subscripted N or V on morphs in
the phonological representation. The termination (t) is not glossed.

‘I sang a song for my brother.’ [Glossed after Evans 1995a]
The clause in (9.6) contains a syntactic verb (whose stem is morphologically verbal),
a direct object DP (morphologically nominal) and a dative referent which is syntac-
tically a DP but which carries inﬂection for verbalizing case (my thematic case),
which converts it into a morphologically verbal unit. The assignment of features is
straightforward. Morphologically verbal stems inﬂect for tense and morphologically
nominal stems inﬂect for modal case which is assigned to DPs. Unproblematically,
although modal case is generally assigned to DPs, it presumably cannot be assigned
to (or perhaps, cannot be realized on) morphologically verbal stems.
In (9.7) the verb is marked with inﬂectional nominalization, as is the dative
DP, while the direct object is inﬂected for associating case and modal case:zero.

e.Br-vcase-nomzn
‘I am singing a song for my brother.’ [Glossed after Evans 1995a]
Since associating case and modal case:zero are assigned to DPs, the inﬂection of
the direct object is straightforward: its morphologically nominal stem inﬂects for the
features assigned to it. The inﬂection of the verb is likewise straightforward since the
only feature available to it is inﬂectional nominalization, which applies to
morphologically verbal stems. But what of the dative DP? The morphologically
verbal stem thabujuN-maruV- will inﬂect straightforwardly for inﬂectional
nominalization, but this yields thabujuN-maruV-nN- which is a morphologically
nominal word in a DP. Without further stipulation we might expect thabujuN-
maruV-nN- to inﬂect for associating case and modal case:zero just like the direct
9.2 Parsimony of the analysis 185
object DP which is also a morphologically nominal stem in a DP. Several conceivable
accounts are available. If associating case/modal case:zero were assigned only to
morphologically nominal words in DPs, and if it were assigned after the assignment
(and realization) of verbalizaing case but before the assignment and/or realization
of inﬂectional nominalization (at which point thabujuN-maruV- is still verbal),
then the correct result is obtained. Alternatively it could be stipulated that associat-
ing case/modal case:zero cannot attach to an inﬂectionally nominalized stem,
though this seems to run against the spirit of the analysis, because it is no longer a
morphological word class per se which is conditioning inﬂection but rather the fact
that the stem ends in a sufﬁx that has caused a change in the morphological word
class, from verbal to nominal. Similar issues arise with the clause in (9.8).

The direct object is assigned modal case as in (9.6). The verb is ﬁrst assigned
inﬂectional nominalization uncontroversially. The dative DP is presumably
assigned inﬂectional nominalization and not assigned modal case for reasons
parallel to (9.7) (which as discussed above may require ordered feature assignment—
modal case ﬁrst, then inﬂectional nominalization—or a weakening of mor-
phological word class as the driver of tam inﬂection). The question which remains is
how nominalization case1 is assigned and why it is assigned where it is. nominal-
ization case1 cannot simply be assigned to syntactic verbs, because the dative DP
acquires it. Nor can it simply be assigned to morphologically verbal words because
once inﬂectional nominalization has been realized, all previously morphologic-
ally verbal stems in (9.6) will have been converted into morphological nominals.
Perhaps one could say that nominalization case1 is incompatible with modal case
which is assigned earlier, although again this weakens the status of morphological
word class as the driver of tam inﬂection (since inﬂection is now sensitive to kinds of
case). Or it could be said is that nominalization case1 is assigned not to any
syntactic class, and not to any morphological word class, but to the class of morpho-
logically nominalized words, that is, those ending in sufﬁxes which convert morpho-
logical verbals into morphological nominals. As such, it appears unavoidable that the
rules of feature assignment are sensitive to syntactic word class (as when modal case
is assigned only in DPs), and morphological word class, and either the morphological
word class history of a word or to certain kinds of case. This is a convoluted
arrangement in comparison to the analysis of Kayardild inﬂection presented in
186 Discussion
Chapters 4–9, where the choice between inﬂecting for tama or tamt is conditioned
always and only by the rightmost morphomic element of the stem.
9.2.3 Why thematic case markers are not verbalizing
The analysis of Kayardild tam inﬂection proposed in Chapters 4–9 does not invoke the
notion of a morphological word class which is distinct from syntactic class. Conse-
quently, if there were content to Evans’ notion of morphological word class beyond its
use as an inﬂection-conditioning diacritic, then the analysis proposed here could be
considered wanting. Evans (1995a:177–80) argues that morphologically verbalized nom-
inals are indeed contentfully verbal in two respects. Here I argue against that position.
The ﬁrst of Evans’ two arguments relates to verbal argument structure. It is
claimed that ‘one may treat the verbal[izing] case as governing NP arguments in
various grammatical functions’ (Evans 1995a:177), and that ‘[a] satisfactory represen-
tation of verbal[izing] case, then, requires verb-like argument structures’ (Evans
1995a:178). Two lines of evidence are offered, the ﬁrst relating to main verb elision
and the second to non-conﬂicting grammatical functions.
The semantics of thematic case (verbalizing case) pertains to events of motion and
transfer (cf }4.1.1) and it is a true observation that Kayardild main verbs in motion
and transfer clauses are frequently omitted if the clause contains syntactic nominals
inﬂected for thematic case. An example is (9.9) in which the highlighted, dative DP
is morphologically verbalized on Evans’ account.
(9.9) (Nyingka) (wuuja) ngijinmarutha kuwand!
ɲiŋ+ka wuː-c-a ŋicu-iɲ-maɻu-t̪-a kuwaɲ-ta

2sg ‹give› 1sg-ø-‹dat› ﬁre stick
‘(You) give me the ﬁrestick!’ [E177.ex.4–153]
The question here is whether main verbs are omissible because words such as ngijin-
marutha are like verbs and can govern subjects and objects, or because words such as
ngijinmarutha are semantically rich enough that the nature of the event can be
recovered pragmatically. Evidence supports a pragmatic account. Kayardild main
verbs of motion are also freely elided from clauses whose motion semantics can be
inferred from the content of non-verbalized DPs. This is illustrated in (9.10) where
movement is inferable from the lexical semantics of jinarungku ‘where to’ and balungku
‘to the west’, and in (9.11) where movement is inferable from the allative case inﬂection.

As Evans notes with respect to examples like this, ‘the meaning of certain case
sufﬁxes includes a movement component, and provided that the meaning of “move-
ment” is expressed, whether by case sufﬁx, verb, or both, the sentence is grammatical’
(1995a:319). This account extends without problem to clauses denoting transfer
events, and the thematic case values (Evans’ verbalizing case). The elision of main
verbs in sentences such as (9.9) furnishes no positive evidence for thematic cases
possessing a verb-like argument structure.
The second line of evidence offered by Evans relates to the requirement on multiple
verb heads of Kayardild clauses discussed in }5.5.1, that they have non-contradictory
argument structures. Evans’ claim (1995a:178–80) is that these restrictions on argument
structure apply also to morphologically verbalized nominals. For example, the dative
sufﬁx in (9.9) governs a direct object which must be the theme (i.e. the moved or
transferred entity) in an event of caused movement or transfer (Evans 1995a:177–80). If
this is true then two predictions follow. First the dative presumably should not appear in
passivized clauses in which the theme has been promoted to subject, since the dative
requires the theme to be an object. Secondly, dative DPs should not appear in the same
clause as DPs in the (thematic/verbalizing) donative case, since the donative requires
the direct object to be the recipient (Evans 1995a:180). My corpus however contains
examples of both constructions in the spontaneous speech of speakers in full command
of the traditional language, shown in (9.12) and (9.13) respectively.

188 Discussion
Sentences (9.12) and (9.13) counterexemplify the hypothesis that morphologically
verbalized nominals have verb-like argument structures. I suggest that what we are
witnessing in Kayardild is an instance of the phenomenon referred to in the gram-
maticalization literature as persistence (Hopper 1991), in which sufﬁxes that have
evolved from erstwhile free lexemes continue to exhibit quirks of synchronic behav-
iour retained from their older function. It is for this reason that thematic case sufﬁxes
behave for the most part in a manner which is consistent with their possessing a verb-
like argument structure. Examples such as (9.12) and (9.13) are illuminating because
they show that the sufﬁxes in modern Kayardild have decoupled from their prior
status as verbs and have begun to accrue a more extended range of usage. More
generally, while it is true that thematic case inﬂections are semantically rich, and rich
in a sense which pertains to argument-like roles, it should be remembered that even
sufﬁxes with no verbal pedigree participate in this kind of semantic behaviour in
Kayardild, as pointed out in }3.2.6 with respect to derivational, compounded nominal
stems ending in the morphomic privative, proprietive, and associative sufﬁxes. The
contribution of argument-like semantics is not the sole preserve of verbs.
A ﬁnal argument given in support of morphologically verbalized nominals being
contentfully verbal is that DPs inﬂected for thematic case cannot be relativized on or ‘be
the pivot in any complex construction . . . reﬂect[ing] the less-than-full argument status
of such constituents’ (Evans 1995a:180). Although it is true, there is little that follows
from this observation, since the only DPs which are relativized on (using an embedded
VP constituent) are subjects and objects, and arguably in one recorded instance (9.23), a
case:proprietive DP; pivots in Kayardild may be subjects, possessors, objects, locations,
or instruments (Evans 1995a:500–11), the latter three of which arguably fall under the
one category of V complement (i.e. direct object or locational object, cf }5.5.2). In terms
of their resistance to relativization and use as pivots, DPs inﬂected for thematic case
(verbalizing case) are no different from DPs inﬂected for other, athematic case values
of comparable semantic richness, such as privative, associative, or utilitive.
There is no compelling reason to regard ‘morphological word class’ as possessing
content beyond its function as an inﬂection-conditioning diacritic, and thus the
analysis proposed in Chapters 4–9, which dispenses with the notion, does not lose
descriptive power by doing so. It is entirely feasible, and more parsimonious, to
analyse Kayardild inﬂection without inﬂectional word-class conversion.
9.3 Inﬂection and recursion
We turn next to the topic of recursion in the inﬂectional morphology of Kayardild.
Given the nature of concord in Kayardild, our expectation is that words in deeply
embedded syntactic positions should typically inﬂect for large numbers of morpho-
syntactic features. Moreover, since it is possible to embed constituents of the same
type within one another (e.g. VP below VP; DP below DP), we expect that features
9.3 Inﬂection and recursion 189
associated with those types of nodes should recur in association with single words: for
example, we should ﬁnd words which inﬂect for multiple tama and tamt features,
multiple case features or multiple number features. The ﬁrst purpose of this section
is to conﬁrm that in general this is indeed the case, by providing a catalogue of
attested recursive morphological structures in }9.3.1. The second purpose is to
consider the apparent existence of an upper limit to the morphological complexity
of Kayardild words. In }9.3.2 it is argued contra claims in the literature, that any
constraints which do exist on the complexity of Kayardild words are not in essence
morphological, but syntactic. Finally in }9.4, I review existing formal studies of
Kayardild inﬂectional recursion and note implications for them of the revised
analysis of the Kayardild facts proposed in Chapters 4–9.
9.3.1 Recursive features and pairwise orderings
This section assembles a catalogue of all of the pairs of features which co-occur in
Kayardild words together with supporting examples (such a catalogue has not been
published previously). The section will conclude by considering the analysis of one
suspicious sentence and two suspicious word forms whose syntactic or morphological
structures are unique and whose grammaticality must be regarded with reservation.
Table 9.4 lists the morphosyntactic features of which multiple tokens have been
attested, each with overt realization, in association with a single word which either
appears in a sentential context, or is reported to have been uttered spontaneously by a
Kayardild speaker. Cross references are given to examples, two of which follow.

190 Discussion
Table 9.4 catalogues the ability of Kayardild words to inﬂect for two values of case,
tamt and tamt. The only word which arguably inﬂects for three values of any
feature in Kayardild is ngimiwaanjinabawu in (9.23), but this appears in our suspi-
cious sentence to be discussed below and which may require reanalysis, in which case
ngimiwaanjinabawu would contain only two case features.
There are no words inﬂected for multiple instances of +sej, +comp or negation.
In each case, the lack of attestation stems from the fact that S00
presents an opaque
barrier to feature percolation (Chapter 8). All three of +sej, +comp, or negation
appear only in full clauses and not in embedded VPs, as a result of which the
accumulation of multiple copies would require percolation across the maximal
clausal node S00
, which cannot occur. I have no instances of a word which occurs in
sentential context and which inﬂects for multiple number values. Such a word would
need to appear in the same kind of syntactic structure required to support multiple
case inﬂections. Since the latter is attested, it would appear that the lack of attested,
multiple number inﬂection is an accidental gap in the corpus.
Table 9.5 lists pairs of distinct features f, g attested as overtly realized on the same
word, in contexts where feature f attaches to a syntactic node which is no higher than
the node to which g attaches.7

In }9.3.2 next, I will argue that the examples cited above contain certain gaps which in all
likelihood are non-accidental. Speciﬁcally, although there are many attested combin-
ations of features which correspond to the syntactic embedding of DP within DP, there
is no uncontentious combination of features corresponding to the embedding of DP
within DP within DP. Nor is there any uncontentious combination corresponding to
the embedding of VP within an overtly case-marked DP. There are however three
suspicious potential counterexamples which should be mentioned ﬁrst.
Examples (9.21) and (9.22) are cited in Evans (1995a) as single words without accom-
panying sentential context and are not reported as having been spontaneously uttered.9

correspond to a particularly deep embedding of four DPs.10

The word Minakuriwulaankiyarrngk is an N head in a DP inﬂected for case:subjective-allative,
which sits within a VP relative clause (i) whose main verb is elided, (ii) which is marked for tamt:
progressive, and (iii) which sits as adjunct to N0
within a matrix DP. That matrix DP (i) lacks an overt
N head of NP; (ii) has a determiner dathinkiyarrngka, and (iii) is inﬂected for number:dual. The number
feature percolates all the way down to Minakuriwulaankiyarrngk.
9
Regarding the length of (9.21) as measured in syllables Evans comments, ‘I have not heard such long
forms in free speech’ (1995a:66).
10
Because word (9.21) also inﬂects for +comp, which on Evans’ (1995a) analysis is complementizing
case, it also exceeds Evans’ (1995a:122–3, 1995b) own reported upper limit of four case sufﬁxes on Kayardild
words (see }9.3.2 for further discussion of this upper limit).
9.3 Inﬂection and recursion 193
would require an embedding of three DPs. On the grounds that my corpus of actual
utterances and sentences, which includes those published by Evans (1995a), contains
no convincing evidence of DP within DP within DP, it seems appropriate to regard
the grammaticality of (9.21) and (9.22) as questionable. This requires a little more
justiﬁcation, since both words were presumably accepted by speakers during Evans’
research. It is possible that the nature of speakers’ acceptance of the forms was similar
to what I experienced in the ﬁeld myself, where (younger) speakers of Kayardild
accepted some suggested forms which were known to be, or later proved to be, ill-
formed in the traditional language, provided that the forms were composed of
legitimate Kayardild morphs. (It is primarily for this reason that all examples
elsewhere in this book have deliberately been restricted to utterances recorded
from older speakers, or published elsewhere as full sentences.)
For similar reasons, it seems prudent to regard example (9.23) as contentious.

The difﬁculty here is that sentence (9.23) was uttered without the two initial words,
which appear in parentheses as (darirra mardalaaja/?mardalaaju). Evans (1995a:116)
cites darirra mardalaaja in parentheses, and adds that, ‘[t]he ellipsed material was
194 Discussion
not present when I recorded this, but was supplied later when I asked about the
meaning of this sentence’. If it is true that (9.23) is grammatical with initial darirra
mardalaaja then it is unique in two signiﬁcant respects. First, it contains the only
instance in my corpus of a word inﬂected for three case values: ngimiwaanjinabawu,
which appears in the only DP within DP within DP attested in a sentential context.
Secondly, it contains the only attested instance of a word inﬂected for a tam feature
from a lower node than case: kurdalathirrinju, which appears inside the only
embedded VP attested within an overtly case-marked DP. Importantly, these mul-
tiple idiosyncrasies obtain only if the main verb is mardalaaja (inﬂected for tamt:
actual), in which case the only interpretation available for the μprop marking across
most of the clause is as a realization of case:proprietive. On the other hand, if the
main verb were mardalaaju (inﬂected for tamt:potential) then the μprop marking
across most of the clause would be a realization of tama:future and sentence (9.23)
would not be syntactically or morphologically unique in any way.11
The questionable status of (9.21), (9.22), and (9.23) bear signiﬁcantly on our
understanding of the relationship in Kayardild between multiple feature marking
and the syntactic structures which underlie it. If (9.21) and (9.22) are ungrammatical
and if the originally-elided material in (9.23) is assumed to have been darirra
mardalaaju then (i) no feature has been attested in Kayardild with more than two
values marked on a single word; (ii) case, the tam features, comp, and sej always
attach to nodes in a particular hierarchical order, with case lowest, then tam, then
sej, then comp; (iii) the attested environments of embedded VPs coincide with DPs
which have no overt case marking. If on the other hand (9.23) begins with darirra
mardalaaja then none of those three generalizations holds. If (9.21) and (9.22) are
grammatical then generalization (i) fails to hold. My suspicion is that the three
generalizations are true, that (9.21) and (9.22) are ungrammatical, and that (9.23) is
ungrammatical with darirra mardalaaja, and grammatical with darirra mardalaaju.
9.3.2 Explaining the limits of inﬂectional complexity
Even if the features case, tama, tamt, and number are all limited to two overt values
per word, we still predict some very exuberant inﬂection in Kayardild. The maximum
expected would be seven overt inﬂections: two of case, two of number, two tam
values, and one of either +comp or +sej. The greatest number uncontentiously
attested though is just ﬁve: number–case–case–tamt–sej in (9.14) above. Evans
(1995a:114) mentions that attempts to elicit words or draw responses to suggested
words with extreme amounts of inﬂection were unsuccessful. One signiﬁcant obser-
vation with respect to this is that extreme inﬂection and the syntactic structures
11
The ﬁnal embedded VP would sit in a locational object ‘instrument’ DP unmarked for case: see }5.5.2
for reasons why instrument DPs in passive sentences can be considered a kind of object in Kayardild.
9.3 Inﬂection and recursion 195
which would underlie it are both unattested in tandem. It is not the case that after
some point syntactic structures continue to increase in complexity while the morph-
ology fails to keep pace;12
rather syntactic structures whose corresponding morpho-
logical structure would be ‘too complex’ also fail to occur. Since the syntax and the
morphology both exhibit upper bounds of complexity, a question that presents itself
is whether those upper bounds are inherently syntactic (in which case, we might
expect more morphological complexity if only the syntax obliged), or morphological
(in which case we might expect more syntactic complexity if only it were compatible
with the morphology). Evans (1995b:410) argues for the latter interpretation, that it is
the morphology of Kayardild which constrains the syntax, a claim repeated in
abbreviated form in Evans and Levinson (2009:444). The claim is interesting as it
implies that Kayardild is a counterexample to the principle of ‘morphology-free
syntax’ (Zwicky 1996). In this section I argue to the contrary that the constraints
are mostly if not entirely inherently syntactic. There are numerous syntactic struc-
tures which would be morphologically felicitous in Kayardild yet which are
unattested, and there are some few syntactic structures which are attested despite
the inability of the morphology to distinguish them overtly from others.
Evans (1995b:410) states that ‘there are morphologically imposed limits to the syntac-
tic possibilities of recursion’ in Kayardild. To express the morphological constraints on
word structure Evans proposes a model which I will term ‘templatic opportunism’.
Templatic opportunism states that a Kayardild word contains just one templatic slot for
each of Evans’ adnominal case (corresponding on my analysis to case), relational
case (also corresponding to my case), modal case (my tama), and complementiz-
ing case (my +comp and +sej), and that if any feature has two values which are to be
realized overtly, then one value must co-opt an empty slot belonging to another feature
(Evans 1995b:410).13
The proposal is then that the syntax is constrained to generate just
12
This alternate scenario is encountered in Old Georgian and Hurrian (Plank 1995:93). In Old Georgian
and Hurrian a limited form of inﬂectional recursion occurs with respect to case marking, in which a word
can inﬂect for no more than two case sufﬁxes, even when the syntactic structures involved contain more
than two layers of DP embedding.
13
Evans (1995a:122–3) contains a different proposal, and one which is less explicit than Evans (1995b).
A diagram shows four ‘ranks’ of inﬂection and four groupings of inﬂectional endings: [adnominal case and
number], [relational case], [modal case], [associating case and complementizing case]. It is not clear if
groupings should correspond to ranks, or if ranks are equivalent to ‘slots’ in Evans (1995b). It seems that
ranks and slots should not be equated, since if we count number among our inﬂections, then the word
ngurruwarrawalathinabamaruthurrka which is reported by Evans as occurring in spontaneous speech
would exceed the number of available slots, with its ﬁve inﬂectional sufﬁxes. Evans (1995a) also places
explicit caps of two overt values on relational case (which together with adnominal case approximates to
my case) and modal case (my tama) and of one value on complementizing case (my +sej and +comp).
These caps are not mentioned in Evans (1995b) and conceptually they are fundamentally different to Evans’
(1995b) proposal. Evans (1995b) seeks to have the syntax constrained by limits on morphological expo-
nence, whereas a cap that is placed on relational, modal, and complementizing case but not on adnominal
case would constrain the system according to morphological function. Given that such functions can never
exist or fail to exist independently of syntactic structures, a constraint on morphological function is much
196 Discussion
those structures which can be distinctly realized by the templatically opportunistic
morphology; should the morphology be unable to overtly realize a given set of mor-
phosyntactic features, then the corresponding syntactic structure will be ill-formed.
This model correctly predicts the attested maximum of four overt exponents for case,
tama, and +comp/+sej (it says nothing of number) but it falsely predicts structures
which are not attested, and falsely eliminates structures which are. We begin with an
example of predicted yet unattested syntactic structures.
If templatic opportunism were all that ultimately constrained the nature of embed-
ding in Kayardild syntax then we would expect to ﬁnd words inﬂected for example with
three or four overt tama markers (since there are up to four slots available). A word with
three tama features could reasonably be expected to appear on a direct object in an
embedded VP constituent, embedded under another VP constituent embedded within a
matrix S00
, for example in the equivalent of ‘I saw the man watching the women cooking
food’. Such words and structures are unattested though. The maximal embedding of VP
is one level deep under S00
, a fact which does not follow from any constraints imposed by
templatic opportunism but instead is inherently syntactic.
Evans’ (1995b:410) model also predicts that if the morphosyntactic features of a
syntactic structure cannot all be overtly realized, then the structure will be ill-formed.
Explicitly included in this is the restriction that Kayardild places on μloc (Evans’
locative case). However, in }6.8, as we examined evidence that Kayardild possesses
case:locative DPs distinct from case:Ø DPs, we saw that for morphomic reasons the
μloc exponent of case:locative rarely appears overtly. This in turn neutralizes the
morphosyntactic contrast between case:locative and case:Ø DPs, but it causes no
problem. In direct contradiction of Evans’ model, the syntactic structures in such
cases are amply attested even though the realization of case:locative is blocked by the
morphology. A model which limits syntax to overtly distinct possibilities afforded by
templatic opportunism thus underpredicts, as well as overpredicts, the range of syntac-
tic structures attested.
Evans and Levinson (2009:443) brieﬂy put a related claim, that Kayardild will not
tolerate more than one level of clausal (i.e. S00
) embedding for inherently morpho-
logical reasons, namely that embedded clauses are marked with μobl and that the
language prohibits the appearance of multiple μobl markers. This claim also over-
predicts and underpredicts. First, the claim is that a sejunct complementized clause
(marked by μobl) could not appear subordinated to another sejunct complementized
clause because it would require double μobl marking, which the morphology
prohibits. Yet in a discussion of ‘purpose clauses’ Evans (1995a:519–20) analyses
(9.24) as exhibiting precisely this syntactic structure, remarking that ‘[w]hen a
subordinate purpose clause follows a matrix clause describing some real event, it
the same as an inherently syntactic constraint, and different altogether from the exponence-based con-
straints of Evans (1995b) and Evans and Levinson (2009).
9.3 Inﬂection and recursion 197
may give an inference, being drawn from the main clause, about the future’ (my
emphasis). Note that both the ‘matrix’ and ‘subordinate’ clauses in (9.24) exhibit (one
copy of ) overt μobl marking for +sej.14

Example (9.24) indicates that in the general case the morphological prohibition on
multiple μobl does not block S00
embedding, and consequently the lack of deep
embedding of Kayardild S00
cannot be made to follow from morphological con-
straints. Like the prohibition against recursive embedding of VP, the prohibition
against deep recursive embedding of S00
is inherently syntactic.15
The same line of reasoning can be extended further, to the observation that at most
two values of case (using my deﬁnition of case) can be realized on a Kayardild word,
and not the four which morphological constraints would predict. Again, the evidence
indicates that there is a prohibition against deep recursive embedding (this time, of
DP) which is inherently syntactic.
If templatic opportunism does not provide a satisfactory account, then why does
there still appear to be an upper limit of four overtly realized features of case, tama,
tamt, comp and sej? That limit is not the same as the ﬁve (two case + two tam + one
of +comp or +sej) which follows from the constraints established so far. With
sufﬁcient attention to detail the answer will fall out from the syntax.
Our observed apparent maximum is four overtly realized features. To begin with,
only one of +comp and +sej may occur, so setting +comp and +sej aside leaves a

The direct object ngijinda dulka in the ﬁrst clause has been topicalized so does not inﬂect for +sej.

maximum of three overtly realized values of case, tama, and tamt to account for.
That maximum will follow from the conditions on internal constituents in embedded
VPs which were established in }5.4, plus the apparent limitation on recursive DP
embedding, whose limit is DP within DP.

features from its matrix) the maximal DP embedding will yield two case features,
and clausal tam inﬂection can contribute a maximum of one further feature, yielding
a total of three. In embedded VP clauses inﬂection for the tam features of the local
and matrix clauses yields up to two features, though local tam inﬂections do not
appear on several kinds of demoted logical subject DPs. A demoted logical subject DP
could then contribute a maximum of two case features (if it contained an embedded,
case-marked DP and were case-marked itself), yielding a total of three features. The
remaining DPs in an embedded clause are all situated below VPa and so will inherit
both matrix and local tam. Most of those DPs are case:Ø DPs or case:locative DPs
whose case:locative cannot appear overtly for morphomic reasons; thus even with
another case-marked DP embedded inside them, they yield just one case feature
plus two tam features for a maximum of three features. The only other DPs below
VPa in an embedded VP are those inﬂected for thematic case and here I predict that
one extra overt feature should be licensed: it should be possible for a DP inﬂected for
thematic case to contain one other embedded case-marked DP inside it, in addition
to inﬂecting for two tam values and one of +comp or +sej. This is a very speciﬁc set
of conditions which would be met vanishingly rarely in discourse. Given the size of
the present Kayardild corpus, its absence is almost certainly an accidental gap. In
sum, we do not need to propose any inherently morphological constraints on
Kayardild in order to derive the observed upper limits on inﬂection. The upper limits
to inﬂection follow from demonstrable and inherently syntactic constraints on
syntactic structures.
9.4 Implications for existing formal treatments
Since they were ﬁrst presented in Evans (1985; 1995a) the facts of Kayardild inﬂection
have received attention from a number of formal theorists, including Lieber (1992),
Andrews (1996), Nordlinger (1998), Kracht (2002), and Sadler and Nordlinger
(2006b). This section summarizes the implications for these studies of the reanalysis
and review of the facts of Kayardild presented here.
Andrews (1996) and Nordlinger (1998) are both theoretical proposals within
Lexical Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982), concerned with the nature
of operations that build grammatical structures, and Kracht (2002) is a computa-
tional study of complex morphology within DPs; all three studies refer to Kayardild
and provide partial analyses of its morphosyntax. For the arguments and ﬁndings of
these studies the reanalysis of Kayardild advanced here is largely benign. Although
9.4 Implications for existing formal treatments 199
the reanalysis calls for revisions of the details of these accounts, its implications for
their fundamental approach are negligible, following from the fact that all three
studies focus primarily on the relationship between multiple features marked on a
single word and their formal association with syntactic or information structures of
various sizes. The reanalysis of Kayardild presented here does not alter the basic
observation already present in Evans’ (1985; 1995a) account of Kayardild, that mul-
tiple inﬂectional sufﬁxes relate to grammatical domains of various sizes.
Lieber (1992) argues for a speciﬁc, formal theory of morphosyntactic representa-
tions. Kayardild is cited in relation to the question of how many crucially layered (or
ordered) values of one and the same feature a word may associate with (1992:94–7).
The language is taken to illustrate the outer bounds of complexity, since under Evans’
(1985) analysis a Kayardild word carries up to four exponents of case. The reanalysis
of Kayardild proposed here replaces Evans’ case with several features, for which no
more than two values are attested with certainty in association with any word, and
thus it has no signiﬁcant repercussions for Lieber’s theory.
Sadler and Nordlinger (2006b) are concerned not with the representation, but with
the realization of multiple instances of features and propose a revision to the
realizational theory of Paradigm Functional Morphology (PFM, Stump 2001).
Again, Kayardild is held to be signiﬁcant to the extent that words may associate
with multiple case features. The multiple ‘functions’ of case are taken by Sadler and
Nordlinger to exhibit identical realizations, following a statement to that effect by
Evans (1995a:118). The central argument is that the existence of languages such as
Kayardild demands a recursive component in the realizational architecture of
PFM. In }2.6.7 I noted that Evans’ case does not in general have identical realization
across its ‘functions’. As a consequence those functions cannot all be generated by the
same, recursively applying component and thus the facts of Kayardild appealed to by
Sadler and Nordlinger do not provide an adequate empirical basis for their proposal.
Notwithstanding this there are other facts of Kayardild, namely the permissibility of
multiple values of (my features) case, tama, tamt, and number in association with a
single word which could occupy an equivalent place in a revised argument. The
conclusions from such an argument would be empirically valid and be equivalent to
those of Sadler and Nordlinger (2006b).16
9.5 Summary
In }9.1 I argued that an account of Kayardild inﬂection has no need for special
mechanisms of agreement for motion verbs (Evans 2003), juxtaposition or second
16
In Chapter 11, the realization of the multiple tokens of the same features will be achieved not through
the use of recursive rules as proposed by Sadler and Nordlinger (2006b), but by a fell-swoop, constraint-
based architecture.
200 Discussion
predicates (Dench and Evans 1988; Evans 1995a), or for person (Evans 2003). Each
inﬂectional phenomenon is sufﬁciently accounted for in terms of the non-surface
syntax, antagonism, and concord set out in Chapters 5–8. In }9.2 it was argued that
the analysis of tam inﬂection in Chapters 5–8 is more parsimonious than in Evans
(1995a), requiring few features, fewer combinations of features in association with
individual clauses, and simpler statements of the conditioning factors according to
which the various features are overtly realized. It was also argued that thematic case
markers are not verbal and thus that inﬂection in Kayardild does not involve any
conversion of ‘morphological word class’. In }9.3 I identiﬁed a small set of question-
able data and argued that once it is recognized as such, the attested combinations of
inﬂectional features in Kayardild words is rather constrained. Pursuing this further, it
was argued that there is no cause to believe that Kayardild’s syntactic structures are
constrained by the limitations of its realizational morphology (Evans 1995b; Evans
and Levinson 2009). A morphological account (Evans 1995b) both overgenerates and
undergenerates whereas a good coverage of the data is obtained by postulating a set
of inherently syntactic upper bounds on the embedding of S00
, VP, and DP.
9.5 Summary 201
10
Particles
The past several chapters have accounted for how words in Kayardild inﬂect. This
chapter turns to a class of Kayardild words which do not inﬂect at all. The class
of particles is distinguished not only by a lack of inﬂection, but by a tight regulation
of surface word order. Particles are analysed here as special clitics (Zwicky 1977;
Anderson 2005) which align with the edges of surface syntactic constituents, namely
clauses and DPs. The alignment behaviour of particles and its correlation with a
lack of inﬂection is a new observation. I assume that the empirical facts presented
below could be formalized in an alignment-based framework such as Anderson
(2005) although I do not present that formalization here (but see Round 2009:607–31
for this approach). True particles are covered in }10.1 after which }10.2 discusses a set of
semantically particle-like constituents analysed as particles in Evans (1995a) but
which are treated here as DPs. Roots which function as both particles and (particle-
like) non-particles are mentioned in }10.3. For further exempliﬁcation see also Evans
(1995a:378–89, 394–6).
10.1 True particles
True particles are not present in Kayardild’s non-surface syntactic representation.
Consequently they cannot inherit morphosyntactic features by percolation and so
never inﬂect. Instead I analyse them as being introduced into the surface syntax as
special clitics, where they align with the edges of other constituents, namely clauses
and DPs.
Particles which align with an edge of a clause are listed in Table 10.1. Those which
have more than one function carry subscripts.
Most particles which align with a clause edge align to the left, and those that do can
be assigned a rank which expresses the priority with which they appear at the very
edge of the clause in cases where more than one particle appears. The signiﬁcance
of the ‘last’ rank will be discussed further below. Examples of left edge alignments of
particles at ranks ‘ﬁrst’ and ‘second’ appear in (10.1)–(10.5).

Just one particle, the counterfactual maraka1, is attested aligning to the right of the
clause as shown in (10.7). Maraka1 may also align at the left, in the ‘last’ rank, to be
discussed next.

The particles of rank ‘last’ align at the left edge of the clause, except that even further
to the left of them can appear a DP labelled DPLEFT which typically has a high or
emphatic discourse prominence. Similar to particles, DPLEFT aligns with the left edge
of the clause in the surface syntax, in a rank ‘next-to-last’. This state of affairs is not
equivalent to particles of rank ‘last’ appearing as simple second position clitics, since
(i) additional particles can appear even further to the left of DPLEFT, (ii) while
particles of rank ‘last’ appear after DPLEFT, they are not attested after ﬁrst-position
verbs, and (iii) not every clause contains a DPLEFT constituent, in which case particles
of rank ‘last’ can appear in ﬁrst position.
204 Particles
In (10.8) both clauses contain counterfactual mara in rank ‘last’. In the ﬁrst clause
there is no DPLEFT and so mara sits at the very left edge of the clause. In the second
clause it is preceded by DPLEFT.

The meaning of kiyamanda is not clear. Presumably it is a manner nominal with the underlying stem
/kiaman-/.
10.1 True particles 205
Several other particles share this alignment behaviour. Data on kalala ‘really’
(Evans 1995a:384) are scarce, but are consistent with a left aligning particle in the
‘last’ rank, as in (10.12) where the subject DP is presumably DPLEFT, and (10.13) with
no DPLEFT.

The most complex alignment behaviour is exhibited by maarra ‘all/only’. In its ﬁrst
function it takes semantic scope over the clausal predicate, yielding a clausal meaning
‘subject only/all do X’. In this function it aligns with the left edge of the clause in
rank ‘last’ and requires the subject to be DPLEFT and therefore (if it is overt) to align
further to the left. An example with an overt subject is shown in (10.27) and an elided
subject in (10.28).

In its second function maarra2 ‘all’ takes semantic scope over a DP. The particle
maarra2 aligns with the left edge of the clause and also with the left edge of its DP,
hence when the DP is overt it appears directly after maarra2, as in (10.31).

10.2 Particle-like DPs
In addition to true particles Kayardild possesses a small set of nominal words with
particle-like meanings which are analysed in Evans (1995a) as particles. Unlike true
particles however, these nominal words generally do inﬂect, and their word order is
freer that that of true particles. This is true even of Evans’ ‘pre-verbal particles’
(1995a:298–302), which need not appear in immediately preverbal position. A list of
particle-like DPs is given in Table 10.3.
The nominal stems buth- and yuuth- can be used in a spatial sense as ‘behind’ and
‘ahead’ respectively, or in a temporal sense as ‘later’ and ‘already’. I analyse these
words as N heads in otherwise empty DPs. In their spatial sense buth- and yuuth-
DPs are daughters of VPg.3
Accordingly they fail to inherit tama:instantiated (which
attaches to VPb), as shown in (10.32)–(10.33), but do inherit and inﬂect for tama
values which attach to VPg such as tama:present (10.34) and tama:future (10.35).

There may be some interspeaker variation on this point, with some speakers placing the spatial buth-
DP as daughter of VPb in which case it inﬂects for tama:instantiated. Sally Gabori produced the sentence
in (a), and Dawn Naranatjil has been recorded self-correcting from buthi (with inﬂection for tama:
instantiated) to buda (without it) in a tama:instantiated sentence.

Evans (1995a:298) reports that minyi ‘towards’ does not inﬂect for tama (Evans’
modal case) but the three examples provided (1995a:302) are inconclusive, as each
clause associates with tama:instantiated which is realized by μloc, and the μloc
inﬂection of /i/-ﬁnal stems such as minyi /miɲi/ is identical to the uninﬂected form.
I have no instances in my corpus which shed further light on its inﬂectional behav-
iour, but judging from attested word order (before and after the verb, and interior to
the clause), minyi behaves like a DP rather than a particle.
10.3 Roots with dual behaviour
There are two roots which function both as true particles and as N heads in a particle-
like DPs which inﬂect. The ﬁrst is kada- ‘again’, which usually inﬂects (see Appendix
B, }}B.2.4; B.6.4). In (10.42) however kada escapes all inﬂection including for +comp.
Such inﬂectional behaviour should not be possible for any DP other than a topica-
lized DP. However, only DPs which are usually sisters of V can be topicalized and
there is no reason to believe that kada ‘again’ is ever a sister of V. I conclude,
therefore, that kada functions in (10.42) as a particle. In (10.43) kada avoids inﬂection
for tama:future and appears again to be functioning as a particle aligned at the left
edge of the clause.

The root nginja- ‘frustrated’ expresses that an event goes against some purpose or

Constraint-based realizational
morphology
A central organizing principle in the analysis of Kayardild morphology has been
an assumption that between the morphosyntactic representation of a word and its
underlying phonological representation there exists another, morphomic representa-
tion. As a shorthand, it will be convenient to label these three levels  (morphosyn-
tactic), M (morphomic), and  (underlying phonological). Chapters 5–9 explored the
mapping between syntactic structures and . This chapter presents an analysis of the
mappings between  and M, and M and . The general nature of the analysis
and issues involved in its formalization are outlined in }11.1 and }11.2. Mappings
from  to M are formalized in }11.3, and from M to  in }11.4. Allomorphy which is
conditioned by surface phonological structure is formalized in }11.5.
11.1 Mappings between levels in constraint-based grammar
In addition to an adequate set of representational levels, we require a method of
relating representations to one another across those levels. To this end I will employ
an approach based on Optimality Theory (OT, Prince and Smolensky 2004 [1993]).
Some of the speciﬁc assumptions of OT will be set aside but the general, constraint-
based architecture of the grammar is essentially the same. The basic elements of the
constraint-based approach are covered in }11.1 and the reader who is well versed
in Optimality Theory may wish to glance at the list of constraint types at the end of
}11.1 and otherwise skip ahead to }11.2. In }11.2 I introduce a novel family of ‘Lexical
Grounding’ constraints which robustly provide for mappings across representational
levels whose constitutive elements (such as features, morphomes, phonological
strings) are different from one another.
A constraint-based grammar is divided into one or more levels, at each of which
one representation, the input, is mapped to another, the output. The mapping is
achieved via the selection, given an input, of an optimal output candidate, chosen
from amongst a large candidate set.
The process of selecting an optimal output candidate is fundamentally compara-
tive. Each candidate is evaluated in terms of its possession of desirable traits and the
candidate which performs better than all others is the winning candidate. The
desirable traits may be expressed purely in terms of the output candidate itself (for
example, ‘the output must not contain the sequence AB’) or they may be expressed in
terms of both the output candidate and the input (for example, ‘the element C in the
input must have a realization D in the output’). Such demands on candidates are
formalized in terms of constraints. All constraints are expressed in absolute terms,
for example ‘x has property p’ and not ‘x prefers/tends to have property p’, and
candidates are evaluated in terms of whether they satisfy each constraint or violate it,
and if they violate it, to what degree. This gives us in effect a large array with
constraints along one dimension, candidates along another, and cells ﬁlled with the
evaluation of each candidate by each constraint.
Constraints are ranked with respect to one another. This ranking is crucial to the
process of selecting a winning candidate. First we can note that given a ranking of
constraints, it is possible to take any pair of candidates, a and b, and to determine
which (if either) is more harmonic that the other: a is more harmonic than b if it
better satisﬁes the highest ranking constraint which evaluates the two differently. As
such, a pair of candidates will always be distinguished into a more harmonic and less
harmonic member unless every last constraint evaluates both candidates identically.
In the overall selection of an output, the winning output candidate is simply that
candidate which, in each of its pairwise comparisons with all other candidates, is
always the more harmonic. Given that the relationship ‘more harmonic than’ depends
crucially on the ranking of constraints, it follows that the ranking of constraints plays a
crucial role in selecting the winning candidate, that is, the output form.
The standard tool for visualizing candidates’ evaluations by a given ranking of
constraints is the tableau. The tableaux to be used here are of the comparative type
(Prince 2002), which possess a number of advantages over earlier tableau formats in
terms of the clarity with which they present information that is most pertinent to
arguments about constraint ranking. A schematic example is shown in (11.1).

Constraints are arrayed in columns (11.1a) from highest ranking at the left to lowest

216 Constraint-based realizational morphology
crucially ranked with respect to one another are separated by a dashed line (11.1b).
Candidates are arrayed in rows (11.1c). The winning candidate (11.1d) is set above all
others, with a ‘+’ symbol pointing to it. The input is placed in the top, left hand
corner (11.1e). Individual evaluations, measured in terms of the number of violations of
a constraint which a candidate incurs, are placed in the cells of the table as subscripted
roman numerals (11.1f); if a candidate fully satisﬁes a constraint no numeral is entered.
On the row corresponding to any losing candidate the comparative performance of
that candidate against the winner is shown in the appropriate column for each
constraint: ‘W’ indicates that the winner better satisﬁes the constraint in question, ‘L’
indicates that the loser does so, and blank indicates that neither performs better.
The distribution of Ws and Ls in a comparative tableau highlights the relevance
possessed by individual losing candidates for the ranking of various constraints.
Recall that in each pairwise comparison the winning candidate must better satisfy
the highest ranking constraint which distinguishes it from another candidate.
In terms of the tableau this means that the leftmost unequal comparison (i.e. W or L)
in every loser’s row must be W—this corresponds to the winner better satisfying
the highest ranking constraint which distinguishes it from the loser. For example,
in tableau (11.2), the comparative evaluation of cand2 shows that constraint CB must
outrank constraint CC.

In terms of their ranking, constraints can be divided into those which are never
violated by winning output candidates, termed undominated constraints on the
assumption that no other constraint crucially dominates them; and those which are
crucially dominated and therefore violated by at least some winning candidates, in
order that a higher ranking constraint be satisﬁed. In addition to their appearance in
tableaux, constraint rankings can be displayed linearly as illustrated in (11.3), or as
a Hasse diagram (a standard visualization tool used to represent partially ordered
sets), as illustrated in Figure 11.1, where any two constraints joined by a vertex are
crucially ranked, and the uppermost is ranked higher.

For the analysis of Kayardild the mappings from  to M and from M to  will be
analysed in terms of one constraint-based grammar each. Since many constraints will
be deﬁned so as to compare elements in the output with matching elements in input,
11.1 Mappings between levels in constraint-based grammar 217
the Optimality Theoretic notion of correspondence will be used to ensure technically
that the correct elements are compared with one another. According to correspond-
ence theory (McCarthy and Prince 1999) a pair of elements in the input and output
may stand in correspondence with one another, or not. Constraints can then evaluate
matters such as whether a given element possesses a correspondent, or how an
element compares to its correspondent in some respect. For example, what is
traditionally termed ‘deletion’ can be regarded as a case in which an input element
lacks a correspondent in the output. Constraints may refer to output elements in and
of themselves; to the pairing of input and output elements that are in correspond-
ence; or to classes of output elements deﬁned in terms of their corresponding inputs.
An example of the latter would be the class of morphomes which realizes tama,
which will be written as tama0
, with the prime symbol indicating ‘realization of ’.
Four types of constraint will be used, as follows.
Wellformedness constraints express demands in terms of outputs.1
Typically they
are formulated as prohibitions on certain structures. For example the constraint
*μloc>μinst states that the output of the ΣM grammar may not contain a μloc
morphome immediately followed by μinst.
Alignment constraints demand that the right or left edges of certain constituents
align with one another. For example, the constraint RL-Align(μobl,t) demands that
the right edge of μobl align with the left edge of the termination t.
Faithfulness constraints directly evaluate correspondences. For example the con-
straint Maximality demands that input elements have corresponding outputs, while
Dependency demands that output elements have corresponding inputs.
The ﬁnal constraint type, which I call Lexical Grounding, is a novel proposal
which allows correspondences to be evaluated indirectly via reference to a lexicon of
input–output pairings.
1
Wellformedness constraints will differ from Optimality Theoretic ‘markedness’ constraints insofar as
they cannot be considered universal, and they refer not solely to structures in the output, but also to
outputs-as-realizations (such as tama0
) which inherently make reference to both output and input.

218 Constraint-based realizational morphology
11.2 Lexical Grounding
In many ways Lexical Grounding serves as the constraint-based grammar’s answer
to the realization rules which occupy a central place in many rule-based theories
of morphological realization. Lexical Grounding takes its impetus from OT
approaches to phonologically conditioned allomorphy (Drachman et al. 1996;
Kager 1996; Mascaró 1996a, 1996b; Tranel 1996; Bonet et al. 2007; Kager 2009) and
from rule-based, realizational theories of morphology such as A-Morphous Morph-
ology (Anderson 1992) and Paradigm Function Morphology (Stump 2001). Lexical
Grounding is predicated on two main elements: a lexicon of correspondences
between input and output elements at two distinct representational levels, J and K,
and a family of violable LexicalGrounding (or Lex) constraints.
The lexicon pertaining to a pair of levels J,K contains a list of input–output
correspondences such as those shown in the rightmost column of Table 11.1.
Although these correspondences are not rules in a classic sense, they can be under-
stood as encapsulating the same content as a realization rule in a rule-based theory,
but without the backing of a rule’s transformational component that actually applies
that content to a representation. In Lexical Grounding, the content of the lexicon is
brought to bear on the derivation of representations within the constraint-based
grammar by virtue of the LexicalGrounding constraints.
In a grammar that maps level J inputs onto level K outputs, a constraint Lex-JK
evaluates candidates by taking an input a and scanning the JK lexicon for corres-
pondences of the form a :: x0
for any value of x0
. It then compares the actual output
correspondent of a, which we can call a0
, with the outputs x0
in the lexicon, and
demands that a0
match at least one of these x0
outputs in some certain way. The
inputs a and outputs a0
might be individual elements such as a single morphosyn-
tactic features value or a single morphome, or they can be sets (of features values) or
strings (of morphomes or phonological segments). By ranking Lex-JK appropriately
the output correspondent for a will be constrained at least partly by what is in the
lexicon. The deﬁnition of a basic, Lex-ΣΜ constraint (for use in the ΣΜ grammar)
is presented in (11.4), and a parameterized version in (11.5).

Grammar Mapping type Example

M morphome :: morph μloc :: /+ki/
11.2 Lexical Grounding 219
(11.4) Lex-ΣM ‘no unlicensed mappings’
Where a correspondence exists between a set a of level  input elements and
a string a0
of level M output elements, the mapping a :: a0
is present in the
M lexicon.
(11.5) Lex(μa)-ΣM ‘no unlicensed mappings, wrt. primary morphome’
Where a correspondence exists between a set a of level  input elements and
a string a0
of level M output elements, a mapping a :: x0
is present in the
lexicon, such that a0
and x0
share their primary morphome(s).
A signiﬁcant consequence of the deﬁnition of Lexical Grounding is that even if
the lexicon contains only one correspondence, a :: a0
, for an input a, it is not
the case that a must always be realized exactly as output a0
, rather other constraints
in the grammar, particularly wellformedness constraints, can cause the realization
of a in a winning candidate to resemble the output a0
provided by the lexicon, but
nevertheless depart from it in some respects, and we will see this in practice in the
individual grammars below.
A ﬁnal part of Lexical Grounding is the use of prioritization. This pertains to cases
where the lexicon lists multiple correspondences for one and the same input, which
is how the lexicon represents allomorphy for example. In a phonological analysis
of allomorphy Bonet et al. (2007) demonstrate the utility of marking some lexical
entries as prioritized and then employing a constraint which penalizes the use of
non-prioritized lexical entries. The Lexical Grounding equivalent is the constraint
LexicalPriority in (11.6). Prioritization will also play a role in the individual
grammars below.
(11.6) Lex-Prior-ΣM ‘no unprioritized mappings’
Where a correspondence exists between a set a of level  input elements and
a string a0
of level M output elements, the mapping a :: a0
is present in the ΣM
lexicon and is the prioritized mapping for a.
Lexical Grounding possesses some advantages over similar approaches to constraint-
based morphological realization. A signiﬁcant approach in OT to morphological
realization is the deployment of realizational constraints (Kager 1996; Yip 1998;
MacBride 2004; Xu 2007). These are prototypically of the type ‘aJ ! a0
K’, demanding
that representation a on level J correspond to representation a0
on level K.
A limitation of this formalism is that it stipulates a realization for the input a in
all-or-nothing terms. The realizational constraint will equally penalize any deviation
of a’s output correspondent from the designated form a0
. If control needs to be
exercised over a range of variant realizations for a then multiple realizational
constraints will be required (MacBride 2004). Because each realizational constraint
220 Constraint-based realizational morphology
is independent from others, no principled distinction will be made between con-
straints which licence a set of minor variants a!a0
, a!a00
and constraints which
licence entirely different forms a!a0
, a!z0
. Lexical Grounding allows the grammar
to express and to enforce consistencies of form in addition to points of variation.
The use of a ‘lexicon’ also has some predecessors. Wolf (2008) makes use of
an external ‘lexicon’ of correspondences afforded by the lexical insertion rules
of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993, 1994). The constraint Max-
M(FS)listed demands that a mapping between input features structures (FS) and the
output surface form of a morpheme conform to a listing in the lexicon. Zuraw
(2000) proposes a constraint UseListed which demands that the input–output
correspondences of an entire word conform to a listing in the lexicon. Steriade’s
(1999) theory of Lexical Conservatism aims to account for the phonological form
of neologisms and also relies upon a ‘Lex’ constraint to ensure that the surface
form of a morpheme in a neologism conforms to one of its surface forms listed in
the lexicon. A signiﬁcant difference between each of these previous proposals and
Lexical Grounding is that Lexical Grounding does not directly control surface
forms. Rather, since it is inherently designed to handle variation it allows room
for other constraints (such as those which regulate normal phonological alterna-
tions) to also play their part in determining the output. Secondly, the outputs it
deals with need not be surface forms. Lexical Grounding is a signiﬁcantly more
general module which can implement constraint-based mappings between any pair
of representational levels whose characteristic elements are not of the same kind.
11.3 ΣM grammar
We turn now to the M grammar, beginning with some simple tableaux. The tableau
(11.7) shows the trivial derivation of the word dan-da ‘here-t’. No inﬂectional features
are involved so the morphosyntactic input consists merely of the stem’s lexical
representation shown here as dan and the empty feature value collection ⟨{}⟩. In
the tableau these appear in the top left hand corner along with an indication of their
representational level, .
(11.7)
: dan; 〈{Ø}〉 R-Align (ω,t) R-Align (t,ω)
M: √>t
a. M: √ W1
b. M: √>t>t W1
The candidates are each displayed as a string of ordered morphomic elements
separated by an ordering sign ‘>’ and beginning with the stem, which for brevity
will be indicated simply as ‘√’ (it will be assumed here that stems are always realized
11.3 ΣM grammar 221
correctly in the output as one contiguous element2
). An indication is also given of
outputs’ representational level, M. The winning candidate in this case consists of
the stem followed by the termination, t. Just two constraints are shown in (11.7).
These are the constraints deﬁned in (11.8) and (11.9) which demand that every output
word (o) end with t, and that every t appear at the end of an output word. Losing
candidate (11.7a), with no t, violates the ﬁrst constraint while losing candidate (11.7b),

The right edge of all words aligns with the right edge of a t morphome.
(11.9) R-Align (t,o) ‘All t’s appear at the end of a word’
The right edge of all t morphomes aligns with the right edge of a word.
The constraints in (11.8) and (11.9) are undominated in the grammar and are never
violated by a winning candidate. To economize on space all tableaux below will
omit any reference to candidates which violate (11.8) and (11.9) and the constraints
will not be displayed in the tableaux.
A more interesting tableau is (11.10) which shows the derivation of danurruwa
‘here-assoc-t’, inﬂected for the feature collection ⟨{case:associative}⟩. In this
tableau and in the tableaux to follow we will need to keep track of correspondences
between input feature values and output morphomic elements. This is done
through the use of subscripts. Co-subscripted elements in the input and output
are in correspondence. Elements in either the input or output which lack a
correspondent are unsubscripted.

winning candidate violates Dep-M just once because the word ﬁnal t in the output
has no input correspondent. (As mentioned above, we need not consider candidates
which do not end with t.) Candidate (11.10a) differs from the winner by not placing
input case:assoc and output μassoc in correspondence, thereby incurring two
violations of Dep-M (one for μassoc and one for t) and one of Max-M (for
case:assoc). Losing candidate (11.10b) provides input case:assoc with an output
correspondent so fares equally as well as the winner against Dep-M and Max-M,
but it contains a correspondence not listed in the M lexicon and hence violates
Lex-M.

Each element in the -level input has a correspondent in the M-level output.
(11.12) Dep-M ‘no vacuous morphomes’
Each element in the M-level output has a correspondent in the -level input.
11.3.1 The SM lexicon
The lexicon for M correspondences in given in Table 11.2. Correspondences are
organized by morphosyntactic features, which are listed at the far left, and values,
given to the left of the each ‘::’ sign in the bulk of the table. At the M level, some few
morphomes will already be assigned a phonological juncture feature which appears
as ‘-’ and ‘+’ to the left of the primary morphome, and some will carry a positive
allomorphy feature shown as a double acute accent over the morphome’s μ preﬁx.
11.3.2 Default linearization in M
Feature percolation passes to the realizational morphology a collection of features
which includes an ordering between any pairs of case or number features associated
with different, hierarchically ordered DPs, and between any pairs of tama, tamt, and
+neg features associated with different, hierarchically ordered clauses including
embedded VPs. In the default case these orderings, present in the  input, will be
maintained in the M output by virtue of the constraint Linearity-M, adapted from
the standard Linearity constraint of correspondence theory (McCarthy and Prince
1999) and deﬁned in (11.13).

Although the feature value collections derived by percolation contain some ordering
information, they do not contain ordering between values of +comp, +sej, tama,
tamt, and +neg associated with the same clause, or between case and number
associated with the same DP. The default orderings we require are +neg>tamt>
+comp/+sej and tamt>+comp/+sej as well as num>case. These can be generated
using alignment constraints of the kind LR-Align(f0
,√) ‘align the left edge of all
realizations of feature f with the right edge of a stem’. Each alignment constraint
of this type will demand that the realization of a feature’s value be ordered directly
after the stem, and one violation is incurred for each other feature’s realization
which interposes between them. Because the number of violations increases with
the distance between the stem and the feature’s realization, these constraints ensure
that realizations appear as close as possible to the stem even if they are prevented
from being immediately adjacent to it. By ranking the constraints which pertain to
each feature we establish a ranking of priorities in terms of whose realization gets
closer to the stem. Thus the rankings we require are those in Figure 11.2 (the reason
for placing Lin-M at the top will be explained below).
Tableau (11.15) illustrates the ranking of LR-Al(neg0

by it. The word derived is kamburinangkuuntha ‘talk-neg-pot-sej’ inﬂected for

The winning candidate incurs no violations of the highest-ranking LR-Align(f0
,√)
constraint because the realization of +neg is situated immediately after the stem. It
incurs one violation of LR-Align(tamt0
,√) because the realization of tamt:potential
is one step removed from the stem, and two violations of LR-Align(sej0
,√) because
the realization of +sej is two steps removed. Any other ordering of the realizations of
features may lessen the violations of some constraints but only at the expense of
raising the number of violations of higher-ranked constraints.3
This is illustrated by
losing candidate (11.15a) which has fewer violations of LR-Align(tamt0
,√) but at the
cost of increasing the violations of the higher-ranked constraint LR-Align(neg0
,√).
The LR-Align(f0
,√) constraints must be ranked below Lin-M in order not to
override the ordering represented in the feature collection. This is illustrated in (11.16)
which also shows the constraints LR-Align(num0
,√) and LR-Align(case0
,√). The
word being derived is natharnurruwalathina ‘camp-assoc-pl-abl’, inﬂected for

The winning candidate preserves the input ordering in the output and having done
that, also places the realization of num closer to the stem than the realization of case.

An assumption here is that all output elements are ordered with respect to one another. This could be
implmented with an undominated constraint which penalizes any lack of ordering.
226 Constraint-based realizational morphology
Loser (11.16a) preserves the input ordering but orders num after case. Loser (11.16b)
fares better than the winner against the highest-ranked LR-Align(f0
,√) constraint,
LR-Align(num0
,√) by placing the realization of num ﬁrst after the stem. In doing so
though it violates Lin-M by failing to preserve input ordering. The fact that this
candidate is not the winner demonstrates the need for Lin-M to rank above the LR-
Align(f0
,√) constraints (given the ranking of the LR-Align(f0
,√) constraints, estab-
lished by loser (11.16a)). Loser (11.16c) is included to illustrate that Max-M also
ranks above the LR-Align(f0
,√) constraints: it is not sufﬁcient in order to reduce
violations of LR-Align(f0
,√) simply to leave a feature unrealized. Candidate (11.16c)
does this and thus incurs a violation of higher-ranked Max-M.
11.3.3 Linearization of speciﬁc morphomes
Beyond the default principles of linearization, the morphomes μobl, μdes (morpho-
mic desiderative), and μloc all have particular restrictions on their linear arrange-
ment within the word which are analysed now in turn.
In the default case, when two tam features are ordered with respect to one another
in an input feature value collection then the ordering of their realizations in the
output will be the same, due to the inﬂuence of Lin-M. Restrictions on μobl can
overrule that default (Evans 1995a:129–33, 1995b). A μobl morphome must always
appear to the immediate left of the termination t even at the expense of contradicting
ordering in the input feature collection and violating Lin-M. This can be seen in
(11.17) where the ﬁnal two words inﬂect for matrix tama:prior and embedded tama:
continuous, but do so in a linearly unusual order: the realization of matrix tam
appears inside that of embedded tam, in order that μobl, which realizes embedded
tama:continuous, can appear directly before t.

The winning candidate orders the realization of matrix tama before that of embed-
ded tama. In doing so it violates Lin-M once, for having reversed the ordering
of one pair of features; however it does not violate RL-Align(μobl,t). Losing
candidate (11.18a) orders all realizations isomorphically with their inputs. It avoids
violating Lin-M but in doing so violates the more highly-ranked RL-Align(μobl,
t). The fact that candidate (11.18a) fails to win shows that RL-Align(μobl,t)
outranks Lin-M. Loser (11.18b) gratuitously reorders the realization of case and
so incurs an additional violation of Lin-M. Loser (11.18c) provides our ﬁrst positive
evidence that Max-M outranks Lin-M. It avoids the winner’s violation of Lin-
ΣM without incurring a violation of RL-Align(μobl,t) by leaving tama:cont unreal-
ized, but in doing so Max-M is violated.
Kayardild does not permit sequences μobl-μobl.4
When two features which
are usually realized by μobl appear in the same feature value collection only one
μobl surfaces. This occurs in (11.19). The clause is complementized and sejunct, with
the ﬁnal DP a topic. The tama value is emotive, which like +sej is realized by μobl.
All else equal the word balmbinja ought to inﬂect overtly for tama and +sej but
only one copy of μobl appears. (Regarding the inﬂection of the tamt:desiderative
verb kurrid, see discussion further below.) The derivation of balmbinj appears in
tableau (11.20).

This might appear to be due to ‘morphological haplology’, that is, morphological deletion motivated
by a ban on adjacent, formally identical morphs. Such phenomena have been discussed by Yip (1998) with
respect to realizational morphology in OT, and by Austin (1995) with respect to the Australian language
Jiwarli. In the general case though Kayardild does permit adjacent, identical morphs (Evans 1995a:132), as in
sentence (11.22). The ban on μobl-μobl is more parsimoniously analysed in terms of every μobl needing to
be adjacent to t.

Tableau (11.20) displays two winning candidates whose form is identical. Both incur
two violations of Max-M due to the lack of realization of tamt, and one of either
tama or +sej. Loser (11.20a) realizes both tama and +sej thus incurring one fewer
violation of Max-M but violating RL-Align(μobl,t) in the process. Loser (11.20b)
realizes both tama and +sej on the same output μobl morphome. This conﬂation
of multiple inputs onto a single output violates the undominated constraint Lex-
icalUniformity-M, deﬁned in (11.21). LexUnif-M is adapted from the standard
Uniformity constraint of correspondence theory (McCarthy and Prince 1999).
(11.21) LexUnif-M ‘no multiple inputs for an output’
An output string a0
of level M output elements has no more than one
corresponding input set a of level  input elements, where the mappings
a :: a0
are present in the lexicon.
Without LexUnif-M the grammar would realize with just one copy of a morpho-
mic string any combination of (sets of) feature values which map to the same string
type. Although this would not be problematic in the case of (11.20b), it is not how
Kayardild inﬂection operates in general. This is illustrated in (11.22) where case:
proprietive and tama:future are each realized by a separate instance of μprop.

The second morphome with idiosyncratic linearization behaviour is μdes, the mor-
phomic desiderative. The μdes morphome realizes just one feature value, tamt:
desiderative. For reasons which are currently unclear, clauses with tamt:des are often
complementized in my corpus, but only in sejunct clauses such as (11.19). The feature
+sej is usually realized by μobl, however on words which would be expected to
inﬂect for tamt:des and +sej the output combination *μdes-μobl is not found. I will
attribute absence of that sequence to an undominated constraint RL-Align(μdes,t)
which demands that μdes appear directly before t. What is found instead of *μdes-
μobl is simply μdes, as on the verb kurrida in (11.19). To account for the fact that
μdes appears at the expense of μobl and not vice versa, the constraint *μobl 'the
output does not contain μobl’ is ranked above over *μα, a constraint which penalizes
every primary morphome in the output (in tableaux I indicate counts only of sufﬁxal
morphomes). This is shown in tableau (11.23) for kurrida, inﬂected for the feature
collection ⟨{tama:emotive, tamt:desiderative, +sej}⟩.

The winner in (11.23) violates Max-M twice, once for tama and once for +sej.
Losers (11.23a,b) both fare better against Max-M but violate either of the more
highly-ranked constraints RL-Align(μdes,t) or RL-Align(μobl,t) to do so. Loser
(11.23c) realizes +sej rather than tama and in doing so incurs an extra violation of
*μobl. The winner also violates *μα. Loser (11.23c) shows the importance of ranking
*μobl and *μα low. It violates neither of them, but in doing so it incurs an extra
violation of Max-M which is more highly-ranked.
The third morphome with idiosyncratic linearization behaviour is μloc. It may
appear only before μabl, μall, or t, or be realized cumulatively with μobl. The
cumulative realization of μloc and μobl will be taken care of in the M grammar; in
230 Constraint-based realizational morphology
the M grammar it will be sufﬁcient to ensure that μloc only appears directly before
one of μabl, μall, t, or μobl. That restriction will be implemented here by use of the
undominated cover constraint μloc-condition in (11.24).
(11.24) μloc-cond cover constraint
Cover constraint for all constraints *μloc>m, for all morphomes m ∈ L, where
L is the set of all primary morphomes except for μabl, μall, μobl, and t.
It will be necessary to ensure that the satisfaction of μloc-cond is achieved in the
desired manner. In addition to ruling out the insertion of extra morphomes (which
will be handled by Dep-M and undominated Lex(μα)-M), we must ensure that
μloc-cond is satisﬁed through the failure of μloc to appear, rather than any other
morphome’s failure to appear. This is achieved by ranking *μloc over *μα. We must
also ensure that μloc-cond is not satisﬁed by shufﬂing the order of morphomes.
Previously, the ranking of Max-M over Lin-M allowed μobl to shift position
rather than be deleted in order to satisfy its own high-ranking constraint RL-Align
(μobl,t). The behaviour of μloc is the opposite: in order to satisfy its high-ranking
constraint μloc-cond, it will delete rather than shift. For this to occur it will
sufﬁce to rank a special linearization constraint Lin(μloc)-M above Max-M.
Lin(μloc)-ΣM is undominated, and is deﬁned in (11.25).

case:locative :: μloc,tama:future :: μ̋prop
The winner in (11.27) violates Max-M twice because case:locative is unrealized as
well as tamt:potential. Losers (11.27a–d) all fare better against Max-M. Loser
(11.27a) realizes both tama and case by ordering the realization of case second,
but this contradicts the input ordering and violates Lin(μloc)-M (note that due to
its ranking, a violation of general constraint Lin-M would not be sufﬁcient on its
own to rule out candidate (11.27a)). Loser (11.27b) epenthesizes a μall morphome
after μloc, thus continues to satisfy μloc-cond but incurs an extra violation of Dep-
M because the μall has no input correspondent. Loser (11.27c) also includes a μall
morphome, this time in correspondence with case:locative, but no such correspond-
ence exists in the lexicon and so Lex(μα)-M is violated. Loser (11.27d) simply
realizes case and tama in order but that violates μloc-cond. Finally (11.27e)
suppresses the realization of tama and thereby gets μloc directly before t; however
this incurs an additional violation of *μloc compared to the winner.
The constraint rankings established in this section are summarized in Figure 11.3.
11.3.4 Antagonism
The undominated constraint Antagonism (11.28) will ensure that antagonistic pairs
of features or feature values are not both realized. As mentioned in }4.3.1 a notion of
antagonism, disjunctive ordering, or blocking has long played a role in formal
morphology and so the constraint in (11.28) has been formulated to be universal,
and found in all grammars. Its operation then makes reference to a language-speciﬁc
list of antagonistic pairs (or sets). In Kayardild it is undominated.
(11.28) Antag ‘Do not realize both features in an antagonistic pair’
For two elements a,b which are unordered in the input and which are
deﬁned language-speciﬁcally as antagonistic: a, or b, or both, lack a corres-
pondent in the output.
232 Constraint-based realizational morphology
A second constraint, AntagonismPriority is deﬁned in (11.29). It ensures that in
cases of antagonism where one antagonist has priority over the other, the prioritized
one is realized.
(11.29) Antag-prior ‘Do not realize the low-priority feature in an antagonistic pair’
For two elements a,b which are unordered in the input and which are
deﬁned language-speciﬁcally as antagonistic: where a is deﬁned as having
priority over b, b lacks a correspondent in the output.5
Tableau (11.30) derives the word malantha ‘sea-sej(comp)’ from sentence (5.43).
It inﬂects for ⟨{+comp, +sej}⟩, of which +sej, but not its antagonist +comp, is
realized.

I deﬁne Antag-prior as blocking the realization of the lower priority feature so that in a set of
antagonistic features with a large set of pairwise priority relationships, all of the lower-priority antagonists
are blocked (as opposed to all of the pairwise higher-priority antagonists being granted a realization).
11.3 ΣM grammar 233
The winning candidate only realizes one of the two input feature values. As such
it incurs one violation of Max-M, but it avoids violating the high-ranked Antag
constraint. Loser (11.30a) realizes both features and so performs better against Max-
ΣM but in doing so violates Antag. Loser (11.30b) realizes only one of the two
antagonists so satisﬁes Antag, but it realizes the unprioritized +comp, and so
violates Antag-Prior.
11.3.5 Wellformedness, thematics, and tam
The feature tama is antagonistic with both tamt and +neg, and none of them
has absolute priority.6
Realizations of tama are unable to appear after a thematic
(th or j); realizations of +neg can only appear after th or j; and realizations of tamt
can only appear after th or j, or after μneg (the realization of +neg). Let us therefore
class th, j, and μneg as [+y] and all other morphomic elements as [–y]. The
wellformedness constraints deﬁned in (11.31–11.33) will then prohibit any of the illicit
sequences from appearing in the output. These constraints are undominated and
never violated by a winning candidate.
(11.31) *[+y]>tama0
The output contains no [+y] elements followed by a realization of tama
(11.32) *[–y]>tamt0
The output contains no [–y] elements followed by a realization of tamt
(11.33) *[–y]>neg0
The output contains no [–y] elements followed by a realization of neg.
To economize on space I will use a cover constraint Them(aticity) in tableaux,
which stands in for all three of (11.31–11.33). Tableau (11.34) shows the derivation of
the place name Rukuthina from sentence (5.20) where it inﬂects for ⟨{tama:prior,
tamt:past}⟩, of which tama but not tamt is realized. The lexical stem in this case is a
nominal. It does not end in th or j and so counts as [–y] and is shown as √–y. Loser
(11.34a) realizes both features and so violates Antag. Loser (11.34b) realizes tamt
after the [–y] stem and so violates Them.
6
A subtly different analysis is this: tama has priority but cannot appear after th or j; tamt has a lower
priority and appears wherever it can, which will be only when tamt is not realized, due to antagonism. This
analysis makes a false prediction however in the case when the realization of a tama value is zero on non-
thematic stems, as is the case for tama:. In such cases we would then expect low priority tamt to be
realized because there is no competing tama realization, even after a non-thematic stem. A similar
problem besets an analysis in which the roles of tama and tamt is reversed, so that tamt has priority.
The difﬁculty again lies with values of the prioritized feature (now tamt) whose realization is zero, such as
tamt:actual.

The winner realizes +neg and tamt and places them in the correct order. It incurs
one violation of Max-M because tama is unrealized. Loser (11.36a) realizes +neg
11.3 ΣM grammar 235
and tamt in the other order, which places the realization of neg after the [–y]
μprop morphome, incurring a violation of Them. Loser (11.36b) realizes tama after
the [+y] stem so also violates Them. Losers (11.36c,d) realize only one feature so incur
an additional violation of Max-M. Loser (11.36e) realizes all features and so violates
Antag twice—once for each antagonistic pairing of tama with +neg and tamt.
The grammar will need to penalize candidates which avoid illicit sequences
by shufﬂing the positions of their output elements. I will use the cover
constraint Order to stand in for all of the constraints from }11.3.2 which
ensure the default ordering of output elements. Tableau (11.37) illustrates the
inﬂection of a nominal inﬂected for the thematic case value human-allative:
ngumbanjanijarr ‘2sg-allh-pst(prior)’ from sentence (5.23), inﬂected for
⟨{case:human-allative}>{tama:prior, tamt:past}⟩. The realization of case:
human-allative ends with a thematic and therefore cannot be followed by a
realization of tama.

The winner in (11.37) realizes tamt and not tama so violates Max-M once. Loser
(11.37a) realizes tama and not tamt after the realization of case and thus violates
Them. Loser (11.37c) also realizes tama rather than tamt and avoids violating Them
by reordering the realizations of tama and case, but in doing so it violates Order.
Loser (11.37b) realizes tama rather than tamt and does so by simply leaving case
unrealized, thus incurring an extra violation of Max-M.
Tableau (11.38) now illustrates the lack of antagonism between tam features which
are ordered in the input. The word derived is diyanngarrbawu ‘eat-antt(anta)-fut
(pot)’ from (5.46) which overtly inﬂects for embedded clause tamt (and not tama)
and matrix clause tama (and not tamt). Antagonism pertains only to pairs of
features which are unordered with respect to one another in the feature collection
h{tamt:antt,tama:anta}>{tama:fut,tamt:pot}i. The lexical stem is a verb, so ends in
a thematic.

The winner realizes tamt:antecedent followed by tama:future, and because those
features are ordered in the input their realization does not trigger a violation of
Antag. It violates Max-M twice on account of the two features not realized. Loser
(11.38a) realizes tama:antecedent instead of tamt:antecedent and violates Them.
Loser (11.38b) realizes both tamt:antecedent and tama:antecedent and thus fares
better against Max-M but violates Antag.
11.3.6 Null and cumulative exponence of tamt:actual and tamt:imperative
In the M lexicon the feature values tamt:actual and tamt:imperative do not appear
in any simple correspondence a::b. As a consequence they generally receive no overt
realization. Tableau (11.39) shows how candidates which would provide tamt:actual
with an overt realization fail. The word derived is kurrija ‘see(act,ins)’ for (7.10). The
winning candidate violates Max-M twice because neither tam feature is realized.
Losing candidate (11.39a) realizes tamt:act as μprop but violates the undominated
constraint Lex(μα)-M in doing so.7
Loser (11.39b) realizes tamt:act as t and again
violates Lex(μα)-M. Loser (11.39c) realizes tama and violates Them. The analysis
for tamt:imperative is entirely parallel.

The losing candidates (11.39a,b) also violate the constraint Lex-M. However, in tableau (11.50) we will
ﬁnd evidence for ranking Lex-M below Max-M. The constraint which is doing the crucial work here is
therefore undominated Lex(μα)-M.

In contrast to (11.39) where the winning candidate violated Max-M twice, in (11.40)
and (11.41) the winner violates Max-M just once. The winners’ correspondence is
between a set of two input features and one output morphome. The losing (a)
candidates are based on the correspondence {+neg} :: μneg which also appears in
the lexicon but which only provides a correspondent for the neg feature, not to
tamt, and thus they incur a second violation of Max-M.
In cases where the lexicon provides multiple correspondences for an input feature
value the grammar must also ensure that they are not all used at once.8
The losing (b)
candidates in (11.40) and (11.41) include multiple realizations of +neg. Rampant
exponence of this kind is mitigated by the undominated constraint LexicalIntegr-
ity-M, adapted from the standard Integrity constraint of correspondence theory
(McCarthy and Prince 1999).
(11.42) LexInteg-M ‘no multiple outputs for an input’
An input set a of level  input elements has no more than one correspond-
ing output string a0
of level M output elements where the mappings a :: a0
are
present in the lexicon.
8
Actually the same issue arises even where there is just one correspondence in the lexicon and we wish
to penalize its being used to realize the same feature value more than once.
238 Constraint-based realizational morphology
11.3.7 Allomorphy
The primary morphomes μcons, μprop, and μabl have strong and weak allomorphs
(}2.5). Sometimes the phonology determines which is used. A formalization of that
process is covered in }11.5 below, and what it requires is that the morphology
sometimes passes to the phonology just one allomorph, the strong allomorph, and
other times it passes to the phonology both allomorphs, between which the phonology
chooses. The morphology, therefore, is not concerned so much with strong and weak
allomorphs as it is with the number of allomorphs which the phonology will be given
to choose from: one or two. This will be formalized in terms of an allomorphy feature:
[+A] for a choice between two allomorphs and [–A] for just one (which will always be
the strong allomorph). In glosses the [+A] value is denoted here, as throughout the
book, by a double acute accent over the μ preﬁx of a morphome, as in μ̋cons.
The feature values case:proprietive and case:ablative are realized with [+A]
morphomes, as μ̋prop and μloc>μ̋abl respectively, when they appear in a word
immediately before the termination t, but with [–A] morphomes elsewhere. This will
be formalized by positing multiple lexical correspondences as shown in Table 11.3 in
conjunction with constraints which demand morphomes to be [–A] under the
necessary conditions. In the lexicon, the correspondences involving [+A] mor-
phomes are marked as prioritized (shown with a carat ‘^’).
Taking the example of the proprietive case, the constraint RL-Align(μ̋,t) will
demand that if a [+A] morphome appears in the output, it must immediately precede
t. As discussed in }11.2, the constraint LexPrior-M is violated if a lexical corres-
pondence is used which is unprioritized; as always Lex-M is violated if an input–
output correspondence is not identical to one listed in the lexicon. Tableau (11.43)
now shows the derivation of a stem inﬂected for case:proprietive. The realization of
the case feature in such a word will occur before t and meets the conditions under
which should appear as [+A].

The winning candidate in (11.43) satisﬁes all relevant constraints, while the loser
violates LexPrior because its input–output correspondence does not match the
preferred lexical correspondence. Tableau (11.44) shows the realization of a stem
inﬂected for ⟨{case:prop}>{+sej}⟩. In this word, the realization of case will not occur
immediately before t and so must be [–A].

ranked constraint RL-Align(μ̋,t). The loser (11.44a) satisﬁes LexPrior but then
contains a [+A] μ̋prop morphome which is not adjacent to t. The analysis of
case:ablative and its realizations as μloc>μ̋abl and μloc>μabl is parallel; tableaux
are in (11.45) and (11.46).

We turn next to tama:future, tamt:potential and tama:prior. These are realized
with [+A] μ̋prop and μ̋abl even if the realization is not adjacent to t. To achieve this
they are each given only one lexical correspondence, with μ̋prop or μloc>μ̋abl. Tableau
(11.47) shows how a word which inﬂects overtly for tama:future contains a [+A] μ̋prop
even if the μ̋prop is not adjacent to t. Tableaux (11.48) is an equivalent for tama:prior.

The winners violate RL-Align(μ̋,t) but satisfy Lex-M because their input–output
correspondence exactly matches a correspondence in the lexicon. The losers fare
better against RL-Align(μ̋,t) but in doing so violate the higher-ranked Lex-M
constraint.
In Kayardild song, the strong–weak allomorphy found in spoken Kayardild is
absent (}3.2.6) so all song form outputs contain only [–A] morphomes. This is
formalized here using the undominated constraint *μ̋/song which penalizes any
[+A] morphome in a song word, and undominated Lex(μα)-M which is similar
to Lex-M, in requiring input–output correspondences to have a match in the
lexicon, but it pays attention only to the primary morphome. Tableaux (11.49) and
(11.50) show the derivations of song words inﬂected respectively for ⟨{case:proprie-
tive}⟩ and ⟨{tama:future, tamt:potential, +sej}⟩ (cf (11.43) and (11.47) above for the
spoken register equivalents). Crucially, in song the losing (a) candidates contain
μ̋prop and so violate *μ̋/song.

11.3 ΣM grammar 241
In (11.50) loser (b) illustrates the need for the Lex(μa)-M constraint. The
winner violates Lex-M because its input–output correspondence does not
match a mapping in the lexicon. The same is true of candidate (11.50b). The
difference though is that the input–output correspondence of the winner
does match a mapping in the lexicon in terms of the primary morphome
involved, and this is not true of (11.50b). Derivations such as this highlight the
advantage of using Lexical Grounding: Lex constraints can ensure that input–
output correspondences mimic selected aspects of lexically listed mappings
without demanding adherence in an all-or-nothing fashion. Loser (11.50c) fails
to realize tama at all, thus fares better against Lex-M but in doing so violates
Max-M. The fact that (11.50c) does not win indicates that Max-M must
outrank Lex-M.
The analysis of song forms above applies similarly to μabl, and also to μcons.
The μcons morphome is only ever [+A] when realizing tamt:past. This is shown
in (11.51) where the stem is verbal and hence ends in a thematic. In song, as shown in
(11.52) μcons must be [–A].

11.3.8 Constraint ranking in SM
We have now completed the survey of the M grammar. The overall constraint
ranking which has been argued for is shown in Figure 11.4.
242 Constraint-based realizational morphology
11.4 MF grammar
We move now to the M grammar. In this grammar, outputs are morphs or
allomorph sets, with each morph bearing an accompanying phonological juncture
feature.9
The M grammar is also where allomorphy is found which is conditioned
by underlying phonological form.
The lexicon of M mappings is shown in Table 11.4. A small number of mor-
phomes will have had their juncture feature speciﬁed in the M grammar, and so
these are not associated with a feature in the mapping shown in the table.
Several pairs of morphomes at the M level are realized by single morphs at the 
level, including idiosyncratic -allomorphs of t (}2.4) and the cumulative μloc>μobl
morph /+kurka/. The correct generalization is that morphomes a>b in the input will
always be realized by a cumulative morph if one exists in the lexicon, even if
realizations are also listed for a and for b separately. This can be achieved by setting
up a priority relationship between the cumulative a>b realization and the individual

This kind of behaviour, in which a more speciﬁc form is used in favour of two less speciﬁc ones is
familiar from many linguistic phenomena and is arguably a special case of a general principle of natural
language grammar: that, of a set of available correspondences or rules which could apply to an input, those
with the most speciﬁc structural deﬁnitions are the ones which do apply (the principle has been expressed
elsewhere as Kiparksy’s (1973b) Elsewhere Principle in rule-based generative phonology, and as the
Anderson’s (1992) Pāṇinian Determination Hypothesis, Halle’s (1997) Subset Principle, and Stump’s
(2001) Pāṇini’s Principle in realizational morphology). The formalism employed here could interact with
a general operation that automatically prioritizes cumulative realizations over separate realizations in
accordance with this principle.
11
I assume that one violation is incurred if and only if the cumulative realization is not used even
though the input makes its use possible.

shown in (11.53) and (11.54) where the lexical stem is kurrij- ‘see’. The lexical
mappings that have been prioritized due to their cumulative nature are indicated
by ‘^^’. The losing (a) candidates contain separate realizations of the relevant
morphomes and so violate LexPrior-M. The losing (b) candidates fail to realize
one of the morphomes so incur a violation of Max-M, and the losing (c)
candidates contain output morphs lacking inputs so violate Dep-M.

Juncture features which appear in the  level representation derive from two possible
sources. Some morphosyntactic feature values will have been realized in the M
grammar as morphomes with particular juncture features and those features will
carry through to the  level output by virtue of the undominated faithfulness
constraint Identity(Juncture)-M, deﬁned in (11.55).
(11.55) Id(Junc)-M ‘preserve input juncture features’
A juncture feature associated with element a in the M level input is also
associated with element a0
, the correspondent of a, in the  level output.
Most morphs’ juncture features though will be taken from the lexicon. Constraints
Lex-M and Lex(f)-M will serve this end. Lex(f)-M is undominated, and is
deﬁned in (11.56).
11.4 MF grammar 245
(11.56) Lex(f)-M ‘no unlicensed morph mappings wrt. phonological string’
For a corresponding M pair a and a0
, a mapping a :: b0
is present in the M
lexicon, where a0
and b0
share the same phonological string (i.e. ignoring
juncture features).
Tableau (11.57) shows a derivation in which diacritics are maintained from the input.
The lexical stem is dangka ‘man’.

Because the input contains -μpriv, a morphome with a juncture feature, and because
there is no corespondence in the M lexicon between -μpriv and a -level form,
candidates (a–c) violate Lex-M. There is a correspondence μpriv :: wari however.
Modulo the juncture feature the winner’s correspondence matches that correspond-
ence and so it satisﬁes Lex(f)-M. Loser (11.57a) likewise satisﬁes Lex(f)-M but
fails to retain the input diacritic, and so violates Id(Junc)-M. Loser (11.57b)
introduces juncture diacritics into the realization of t which are not present in the
lexical mapping, and so violates Lex-M. The realization of -μpriv in loser (11.57c)
retains the right juncture feature but deviates from the phonological string which
appears in the lexical entry and so violates Lex(f)-M. Loser (11.57d) strips the morph
/wari/ of its juncture feature and hence its correspondence is exactly like the lexical
mapping, meaning that Lex-M is unviolated but the higher-ranking Id(Junc)-M
incurs a violation.
The termination, t, is realized as the underlying phonological allomorph set {^-a,
-} after a preceding vowel, as +ka after a preceding velar consonant and as -ta after a
preceding coronal consonant. This pattern is formalized with the use of the well-
formedness constraints (11.58) and (11.59).
(11.58) *Cons{^-a, -}
The  level output does not contain a consonant followed by the allomorph
set {^-a, -}.
(11.59) Agree(coronal)/ConsCons
Adjacent consonants in the output have the same value of [coronal]. One
violation is incurred for each pair which does not agree.

The constraint Agree(cor) ranks below Lex(f)-M. This ensures that although it
can force the choice of alternative, lexically listed realizations, it cannot force a
realization to deviate from its lexically listed phonological form.12
Tableau (11.63)
illustrates this. The winner contains two clusters which disagree for [coronal]: /c-k/
and /rk/. In losers (11.63a,b) the cumulative realization of μloc>μobl has been
phonologically altered to ensure that one or other cluster agrees for [coronal].
This reduces the number of violations of Agree(cor) but violates the higher-ranked
Lex(f)-M.
12
Presumably this applies to clusters in lexical stems just as it does in sufﬁxes, but it is beyond the scope
of the present study to formalize the morphology and phonology of stems.

11.5 Allomorphy conditioned by surface phonology
Generative phonologists have recognized for several decades that phonologically
conditioned allomorphy can be sensitive not only to underlying phonological struc-
ture but to derived structure as well (Anderson 1975, 2008; Carstairs 1988, 1998; Wolf
forthc.). There are several cases in Kayardild in which the conditions driving
allomorphy are found not in the underlying phonological form (as addressed in
}11.4 above) but at the surface. Speciﬁcally, they are driven by the avoidance of surface
sequences of two identical short vowels, VαVα, followed either by a third vowel (V) or
by a semivowel (S). They are summarized in Table 11.6, where tV refers to the
allomorphs of the termination t that appear after vowels.
These patterns will be formalized as follows. In the phonology of Kayardild there
is an unviolated constraint against surface strings in which two identical short
vowels are followed by another vowel, which we can call *VαVαV. It drives several
phonological alternations (Round 2009) and importantly here, it plays a role of
allomorph selection. Another constraint *VαVαS penalizes candidates containing two
short vowels followed by a semivowel. Aside from allomorph selection *VαVαS plays
no visible role in Kayardild phonology and is ranked lower than all other phonological
constraints. A second low-ranked constraint can be dubbed *μμaa. This penalizes
output candidates containing a string /aa/ which is preceded by any string of two or
more morae (where short vowels are one mora and long vowels two; consonants are
non-moraic).
Phonological allomorph selection in Kayardild will be analysed here in terms of
these three wellformedness constraints in addition to Priority constraints which
penalize the realization of non-prioritized allomorphs. Each allomorph set requires
its own Prior constraint which I will label Prior-μprop, Prior-μabl, Prior-tv.
The constraints which drive the bulk of the phonology will not be of concern here,
and thus output candidates will only be considered which obey the general rules of
TABLE 11.6 Phonologically conditioned allomorphy involving surface VaVa
sequences

/+kuu/ appears unless in doing so it would result in a surface
VaVaV or VaVaS sequence.
b. μ̋abl {^-naa,

VaVaV or VaVaS sequence.
c. tv {^-a, -} /-a/ appears, unless in doing so it would result in a surface

containing more than one mora.
11.5 Allomorphy conditioned by surface phonology 249
Kayardild phonology. The constraint ranking which will be required is shown in
Figure 11.5.
The termination t is usually /a/ after vowel ﬁnal bases but not after /a/-ﬁnal
bases over two morae in length. Tableaux (11.67)–(11.69) illustrate this pattern. The
tableaux show candidates with various input allomorphs and the surface forms that
then result by applying the rules of the phonology. The constraint ranking acts
to choose the most harmonic output form, and in doing so indirectly selects the
best input allomorph. The losing candidates in tableaux (11.68) and (11.69) establish
that *μμaa outranks Prior-tv.

When the morphomic ablative (μabl) realizes tama:prior it is usually /naa/, and is
followed by the zero allomorph of t. Tableau (11.70) illustrates this. The winning
candidate violates *μμaa once. Loser (11.70a) uses the /napa/ allomorph and avoids
the violation of *μμaa but violates higher-ranked Prior-μabl. The fact that (11.70a)
loses shows that Prior-μabl outranks *μμaa. The winner also violates Prior-tv due

to its use of the zero allomorph of t. Losers (11.70b,c) both avoid that violation but in
turn violate other, higher-ranked constraints. Loser (11.70c) shows that Prior-μabl

When μabl, realizing tama:prior, is followed by μobl it remains /-naa/. It appears as

When μprop realizes tama:future or tamt:potential, it is usually /+kuu/, after which t
takes the zero allomorph. This is seen in (11.73), where μprop realizes tamt:potential,
and (11.74) where μprop realizes tama:future. Losers (b) use the /-a/ allomorph of t,
thereby faring better against Prior-tv but violating *VαVαV. Losers (c,d) use the
unprioritized allomorph of μprop and thus violate Prior-μprop.

*VαVαV. This is illustrated in tableau (11.75), in which losers (11.75b,c) fare better

Finally on the topic of μprop, a comment regarding free variation. The morphomic
proprietive exhibits apparently free variation under certain conditions. Essentially,
where the descriptions above referred to the /kuu/ allomorph being chosen, there is
in fact variation between /kuu/ and /kuɻu/. The precise nature of the variation is not
understood, but supposing that it is truly free variation it may be analysed as follows.
Studies in OT such as Nagy and Reynolds (1995) and Anttila (1997) account for free
variation in terms of variability in constraint rankings. This approach can be applied to
Kayardild by supposing that Prior-μprop is optionally reranked to a position below
Prior-tV. According to that ranking we obtain /kuɻu/ allomorphs corresponding to all
of the /kuu/ allomorphs above (while keeping the /kuɻu/ allomorphs from above as
11.5 Allomorphy conditioned by surface phonology 253
they are). Examples are shown in (11.79), (11.80), and (11.81), which correspond respect-
ively to examples (11.73), (11.74), and (11.75) above, but with Prior-μprop reranked.

In }2.5 it was mentioned that μcons, which has two allomorphs {ŋara, ŋarpa} can also
be analysed as undergoing surface-phonological allomorph selection when it realizes
tamt:past, only because choosing the prioritized weak form /ŋara/ never gives rise to
a violation of *VαVαV or *VαVαS, there is no reason to resort to using /ŋarpa/ and
hence there is no visible, phonologically-driven alternation. This is illustrated in
(11.82)–(11.84).

Appendix A: Categories in
Evans’ Grammar
Appendix A lists correspondences between the features and values employed in this volume and the
categories of Evans (1995a) and Evans (2003). The purpose here is to provide a resource for comparison
between the analyses. Correspondences at the level of features are listed in Table A.1.
The casefeature in thisbook correspondsto Evans’ (1995a, 2003) adnominal case, relationalcase, and
to verbal(izing) case. The few instances where Evans’ adnominal or (non-verbalizing) relational case
categories fail to correspond directly to case values of the same name under the present analysis, are listed in
Table A.2.
Evans’ verbalizing cases are renamed here as thematic case values. Correspondences between Evans’
verbalizing case and thematic case values are shown in Table A.3. The approach has been to retain Evans’
case label, but to discontinue the use of the adjective ‘verbalizing’. Where this would lead to two case values
having the same label (e.g. with Evans’ allative and verbalizing allative), I have selected a new label for
the verbalizing/thematic case value based on semantics. Note that two of Evans’ verbalizing cases each
possess two formal variants (the plain and the middle), each of which is a separate case category for the
purposes of the grammar (Evans 1995a:171–5). Accordingly they are assigned to separate case values here.

Consequential The consequential case in Evans’ consequential nominalization clauses is
analysed here as tama:antecedent and tamt:antecedent
Denizen Corresponds to Evans and Nordlinger’s (2004) verbal denizen case
Privative The privative case in Evans’ privative nominalization clauses is analysed here as
tama:nonveridical
Utilitive Some instances of Evans’ utilitive case are analysed here as tama:functional
case: This corresponds to Evans’ lack of case marking and to Evans’ nominative case
The non-inﬂectional number feature on pronouns here corresponds directly to Evans’ pronominal
number (1995a:201–3). In addition, Evans describes several number and related sufﬁxes (1995a:183–7)
of which some are derivational (cf. }3.1.5). The two inﬂectional values are num:dual (Evans’ dual) and
num:plural (Evans’ lot).
Tamt and negation here correspond to tense and polarity in Evans (1995a) or tamp in Evans (2003),
as well as to inﬂectional nominalization and case marking of verbs. A full list of correspondences for
tamt is given in Table A.4.
tama in this book corresponds to modality or modal case in Evans (1995a) as well as to as certain
kinds of case marking, mostly of dependent DPs of verbs marked with inﬂectional nominalization.
A full list of correspondences is in Table A.5.
The feature value +sej corresponds to Evans’ complementizing oblique case, while overtly realized
+comp corresponds to Evans’ complementizing locative case and the independent use of the
locative.
Turning to syntactic constituents, Evans (1995a) distinguishes ﬁve morphological word classes, of which
the verbal class is identical to the verbal superclass used here, while Evans’ nominals, particles, conjunc-
tions, and interjections all fall into the nominal superclass used here. A summary is shown in Table A.6.
Regarding multi-word units, the DP in this book corresponds to the Evans’ NP. The VP node of Evans
(1995a) corresponds to VPd in the present analysis and not to VPe, which is the maximal VP node here.
Evans’ embedded subjectless S (1995a:484–5) corresponds to embedded VPe. The verbal complex of Evans
(1995a:302–12) is comparable to the lowest levels of the VP here (the fragment dominated by VPa), modulo
the complements of V. A summary appears in Table A.7.
TABLE A.3 Thematic case values and Evans’ verbalizing case
case value Evans (1995a; 2003) equivalents, and notes
Dative Verbal(izing) dative
Donative Verbal(izing) donative
Translative Verbal(izing) translative
Collative Verbal(izing) allative—Semantically, the entity marked by the collative case is
construed as becoming co-located with the clausal subject; either may move (Evans
1995a:168–9)
Purposive Verbal(izing) purposive—Evans (1995a) recognizes one verbalizing purposive
case, realized by the sufﬁx forms /cani-c/~/cani: -c/. On closer inspection, the two
sufﬁxes associate with different semantics so are assigned to separate case values here.
case:purposive is realized as /cani: -c/. It marks an entity which is sought, yearned for or
missed.
Human allative Verbal(izing) purposive—case:human allative is realized as /cani-c/. It appears
several times in Wurm’s (1960) corpus and occasionally in my ﬁeld recordings. It
attaches to personal pronominal stems or stems denoting kin, to mark an allative
adjunct whose referent is human
Objective

Verbal(izing) ablative, plain form—Marks an entity or place, away from which the
direct object moves (Evans 1995a:171–3)

the subject moves (Evans 1995a:171–3)

the direct object moves out of fear (Evans 1995a:173–4)

Immediate Immediate, suppositionaltense—Evans describes three instances (recorded by Wurm
1960) of a suppositional tense, which is formally identical to the immediate (Evans
1995a: 257–8). The morphology makes no distinction between immediate and
suppositional, even if the semantics does. Accordingly they are collapsed into one
category here
Imperative Imperative mood
Incipient Inﬂectional nominalization of a verb, in turn inﬂected for verbal translative
case and a second inﬂectional nominalization
Past Past, almost tense—tamt:past corresponds to Evans’ past and almost tenses
(1995a:260–1). Evans (1995a:255) observes that the form of the almost tense is cognate
with negative+past, but the synchronic analysis does not explicitly link to two. In
addition to similarities in form, past and almost share the same co-occurrence
restriction vis-à-vis tama values. Accordingly in the analysis here, Evans’ almost tense
is {tamt:past, +negative}, and the past tense is {tamt:past, negative:}; the parallels
in form and tama restrictions follow from this

Appendix A: Categories in Evans’ Grammar 259
Appendix B: Distribution of tama
tama features attach to one of three VP nodes in the non-surface syntactic tree as shown in Figure B.1
(cf }5.6). The position which a DP occupies in the tree determines which tama feature values it can inherit
and thus what values its constituent words inﬂect for.
Appendix B provides example sentences which illustrate, via the patterns of inﬂection which they
instantiate, the VP mother nodes selected by various DP types. Because tama features are inherited
from a VP which is superordinate to the whole DP, the inﬂectional behaviour of an individual nominal
word with respect to tama is determined not by the word itself, but by the position of its nearest
dominating DP node which is also the daughter of VP. The determinant of that DP’s position is usually
its semantic–pragmatic role, but in some cases this is overridden by the head N of NP within DP (}5.6). To
accommodate this the subsections below are organized according to DPs’ roles or according to the head
N of their NP as appropriate. Section B.1 provides data for case:locative DPs which could be analysed as
daughters of VPb or as complements of V (cf }5.5); }B.2 presents other DP daughters of VPb; }B.3 provides
data for DPs for which the evidence is ambiguous, and which could be daughters of VPb or VPg;
}B.4 presents DP daughters of VPg; }B.5 presents DP daughters of VPd; }B.6 presents DPs which are
ambiguously either daughters of VPd or of VPe; and }B.7 contains DP daughters of VPe.
Example glosses below do not display underlying phonological representation rather I insert hyphens at
approximate morph breaks in orthographic forms. In cases where an underlying non-zero morph gets
phonologically deleted at the surface, I separate the morphs on either side of it with a short dash rather than
a hyphen. This is visible, for example, in wirdi–nang-ku- in (B. 4), where the underlying /c/ which realizes
the thematic j has been deleted between wirdi- and -nang.
B.1 Case:locative daughters of VPb / complements of V
These DPs inﬂect for all overtly realized tama features, and therefore must be no higher than VPb, to which
the lowest-attaching tama feature attaches. See }6.8 for additional non-inﬂectional evidence regarding
their syntactic position.

B.3 Daughters of VPb or VPg
The temporal nominals balmbi ‘tomorrow; the next day’ and wulji ‘last night’ and the -nguni realization of
case:instrumental all end in /i/, after which the surface realization of μloc is zero. As such it is not possible
to tell in the examples below whether they inﬂect for tama:instantiated (or, in the case of balmbi and wulji,
for case:locative). Consequently, and in the absence of examples in tama:directed clauses, we cannot tell if
these DPs are daughters of VPb which inherit tama:instantiated or daughters of VPg which escape it.

B.4 Daughters of VPg
These DPs are too high in the non-surface syntactic tree to inherit tama:instantiated or tama:directed but
low enough to inherit all other tama values.
B.4.1 Case:Ø locations
Case:Ø DPs which refer to locations are formally neutralized with case:locative DPs when they are
inﬂected for tama (cf }6.8). This section shows case:Ø location DPs which are daughters of VPg, and
which therefore do not inﬂect for tama values which attach to VPb. In these examples, it can be seen that
the DP does not inﬂect for case:locative.

B.5.4 case:proprietive ‘subject matter’ DPs
case:proprietive ‘subject matter’ DPs are presumably daughters of VPd, although the positive evidence
available only shows that they are too high in the non-surface syntactic tree to inherit tama features that
attach to VPb, that is, they must be daughters of VPg or higher.

‘They are ﬁghting one another with spears over that woman.’ [W1960]
B.6 Daughters of VPd or VPε
These DPs have not been attested inﬂecting for any tama values, however thay are not attested in clauses
associated with tama:continuous or tama:negatory which attach to VPd. We thus know that they must be
at least as high as daughters of VPd and could be daughters of VPe.
B.6.1 Counted occasion and unit duration DPs
DPs refering to counted occasions, or durations measured in units are daughters of VPd or VPe, with the
exception of thoses whose NP is head by darr- ‘occasion; time’ (}B.2.5).

‘They would soon be killed up above.’ [E1984-03-01]
B.6.3 Jijina ‘which direction’ #2
One example of jijina exists in which it inﬂects for a tama value which attaches to VPg (}B.4.8). Here, it
does not.

B.6.4 Kada ‘again’ #2
Kada was seen previously, in }B.2.4 where it was the daughter of VPb. Here, it sits in a different position as
the daughter of VPd or VPe. It inﬂects for +sej so cannot be functioning as a particle (}10.3).
(B.105) Not inﬂected for tama:future which attaches to VPg, but inﬂected for +sej, and hence not a
particle (cf }10.3)
