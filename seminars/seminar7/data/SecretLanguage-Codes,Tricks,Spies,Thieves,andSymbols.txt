with the digraph ph (Gager 1992: 95).6
As Gager notes, a palindrome produces the same word when
reversed, so if you discovered that someone had cursed you with a
palindrome, you could not simply counter the curse by reversing it.
The notion of the palindrome, especially palindromic poetry,
has become popular in eastern Europe over the last few decades,
and an iconic relationship between reversibility of form and revers-
ibility of meaning has been explored (Greber n.d.). Palindromic
poems consist of palindromic lines, but the term ‚Äòpalindromic
poetry‚Äô is also applied to poems in which the whole poem is one
long palindrome (Ô¨Årst word equals the last, second word equals the
second last, etc). The thirteenth-century poet Baudin de Cond√©
wrote poems of this type.7
The term is also applied to poems where
the sequence of lines is palindromic (Ô¨Årst line equals last line,
second line equals second last line, etc.).
Semordnilaps
Closely related to the palindrome is a word that yields another
word when spelt backwards. Examples include paws/swap, star/rats,
diaper/repaid, reward/drawer, and tiler/relit. The term given to such
‚Äòmirror words‚Äô is semordnilap‚Äîthat is, palindromes in reverse.
Word-play enthusiasts can have a lot of fun with semordnilaps.
A word in one language may produce a word in another when

The palindrome is Greek-looking, but identifying words is problem-
atic. One can perhaps see phrƒìnƒì ‚Äòmind‚Äô, mouno ‚Äòvulva‚Äô, thilari ‚Äònipple‚Äô (cf.
thƒìlƒì), kriphia ‚Äòhidden‚Äô, and litho- ‚Äòstone‚Äô.

reversed‚Äîas in the case of the name of the forty-fourth American
president, Obama, which yields the Latin amabo ‚ÄòI will love‚Äô when
reversed. In another variation, the phrase stressed desserts is a
palindrome consisting of a semordnilap pair.
Although for most people these pairs of mirror words are just a
minor linguistic novelty, there are people who see signiÔ¨Åcance in
the fact that dog is the reverse of God, which is strange when you
consider the fact that this relationship holds only for English and
only in the modern spelling. If we go back to the Middle Ages we
Ô¨Ånd that while God was spelt God, dog was spelt dogge (earlier
Old English docga). In seventeenth-century witch trials the claim
was often made that the devil appeared in the form of a dog, a
belief that seems to have been prompted by a chance linguistic
relationship.
Acronyms and Acrostics
Words and phrases can be formed from the initial letters of a
phrase or longer text. In such cases we refer to the new word as an
acronym. A well-known example is scuba, which is derived from
‚Äòself-contained underwater breathing apparatus‚Äô. In the Middle
Ages the acronym agla was popular as a magic word. It is an
acronym for the Hebrew Atah gibor leolam adonai ‚ÄòThou, O
Lord, are mighty forever‚Äô. Alternatively it is interpreted as Atah
gabor leolah, adonai ‚ÄòThou art powerful and eternal, Lord‚Äô.
Similar to the acronym is a word, phrase, or longer text that can
be read from the initials of words in a larger text. This is called an
acrostic. The term is derived from Greek akros ‚Äòpointed, at the tip‚Äô
(as with acro-nym) and stichos ‚Äòa line or verse‚Äô. An acrostic is usually a
from anagrams to cryptic crosswords
19
short verse composition in which the initial letters of lines or stanzas
form a word or phrase. Here is a short example from Ben Jonson
(1572‚Äì1637), in which the initial letters of the lines spell wolf.
To Doctor Empiric
When men a dangerous disease did ‚Äôscape,
Of old, they gave a cock to Aesculape.
Let me give two, that doubly am got free
From my disease‚Äôs danger, and from thee.
Acrostics were popular in Akkadian and other Mesopotamian
cultures, and among the Greeks and Romans. The prophecies of
the Erythraean Sibyl were issued on leaves, so arranged that the
initial letters made up a word or phrase. This is not entirely
unexpected given that those involved in the occult seemed regu-
larly to favour various word patterns. In the City of God (18:23)
Augustine recalls being shown a Greek verse purportedly from the
Erythraean Sibyl, in which the initials form an acrostic spelling
out ‚Äò√Öƒ± √¶√ò	 ¬®ƒ±  √∏	√Ö√¶‚Äô (Iesus CHristos THeou
Uios S≈çter) ‚ÄòJesus Christ, son of God, saviour‚Äô. It is scarcely
credible that this verse actually came from the Erythraean Sibyl:
it is much more likely to derive from an imitator. But the example
is remarkable in that the initials of these words spell ‚Äò¬®‚Äô
(ICHTHUS) ‚ÄòÔ¨Åsh‚Äô, so we have an acrostic within an acrostic.
Augustine sees ‚ÄòÔ¨Åsh‚Äô as standing for Christ since, as he writes,
Christ lived in the abyss of mortality like a Ô¨Åsh in the depths of
the ocean. He does not mention that the Ô¨Åsh was a commonly
used symbol among the Christians of the Roman empire.
Here is a Latin acrostic from the classical period. It is interesting
in that it employs the Ô¨Årst consonant and vowel of the proper
secret language
20
names in the Ô¨Årst two lines to make up pedicare ‚Äòto bugger‚Äô. It is
number lxvii in a collection known as Priapea dedicated to Pria-
pus, a God charged with guarding and increasing the fertility of
livestock and gardens. The poem is of a type displayed in gardens.
It is to be read as if spoken by Priapus and it is a threat directed
against any would-be thief who should enter the garden.
Penelopes primam Didonis prima sequatur
et primam Cadmi syllaba prima Remi,
quodque Ô¨Åt ex illis, mihi tu deprensus in horto,
fur, dabis: hac poena culpa luenda tua est.
The initial syllable of Dido follows the initial syllable of Penelope,
and the initial syllable of Remus follows the initial syllable of Cadmus,
And that‚Äôs what will happen to you caught in the garden.
That, thief, will be the penalty you‚Äôll have to pay me.
Acrostics remained popular among leading literary Ô¨Ågures
throughout Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In
1599 John Davies (1569‚Äì1626) wrote Hymnes to Astraea containing
twenty-six poems that all contained the acrostic Elisabeth Regina,
and in 1637 Mary Fage published Fames Roule, which contained
over four hundred acrostic poems in honour of leading Ô¨Ågures of
the day. Each poem was headed by an anagram of the subject‚Äôs
name. The following example is quoted in Stevenson and David-
son (2001: 262‚Äì3). It is addressed to Carolus Stuart, i.e., Charles
the First, represented as sol, the sun, and Maria Henrietta, the
queen consort, represented by Vesta, the Roman goddess of the
hearth.8

Since the seventeenth century, in Britain at least, acrostics have
ceased to interest serious poets, and they have come to be regarded
as a marginal curiosity which is popular only among those who like
word games.
Not all acrostics are to be found in verse. They also occur in
prose. In Hypnerotomachia Polyphili (Polyphilo‚Äôs Strife of Love in a
Dream), a famous example of early printing (1499), the decorated
letters at the heads of the chapters spell out poliam frater

franciscus columna peramavit ‚ÄòBrother Francesco Colonna
loves Polia‚Äô. The work is written in Italian, but the acrostic is in
Latin.
The hidden word in an acrostic can be made harder to Ô¨Ånd by
putting the letters in any Ô¨Åxed position other than the beginning of
each line. An acrostic in which the last letters of each line make up
a word is called a telestich. If the Ô¨Årst and last letters of lines form
words, then we have a double acrostic. There are also triple
acrostics with a name running down the middle of the lines as
well as at the ends. Varying the position of the relevant letters
within the lines produces even more difÔ¨Åcult acrostics. For exa-
mple, the letters could appear in the Ô¨Årst position of the Ô¨Årst line,
the second position of the second line, the third position of the
third line, and so on. In fact, Edgar Alan Poe worked the name
Frances Sargent Osgood into a poem using this method.9
It is easy to
imagine a more subtle pattern known only to the sender and
intended recipient. The typical acrostic is a literary device rather
9
The most extreme form of acrostic is the carmen Ô¨Åguratum in which a
hidden text forms a Ô¨Ågure or pattern within a text. The term carmen
Ô¨Åguratum also applies to a text, usually a poem, where the words are laid
out to form a pattern. In the Greek Anthology there are six poems with the
line length varied so that they form a pattern representing the subject of
the poem (e.g., wings), and a number of the curse tablets from the Roman
empire contain words and letters arranged in shapes. In the Middle Ages
poems were sometimes written in the form of a cross. More recent examples
of this kind of poem can be found in the work of the nineteenth-century
Uruguayan poet Francisco Acu√±a de Figueroa, and in Guillaume Apolli-
naire‚Äôs Calligrammes: Poems of Peace and War (1918). John Cage moves the
lines of some of his poems to the left or right in order to produce an acrostic
running down the centre of the page. Such verse is sometimes referred to as
visual poetry or concrete poetry.

23
than an attempt at serious deception, but cases where the pattern is
complicated fall under the heading of steganography, which is
discussed in Chapter 4.
Some Jewish and Christian scholars claimed to have found
words, phrases, and sentences by examining the sequence of initial
letters in the Bible. They took these acrostics to have been hidden
there deliberately rather than to be the result of chance. Examples
are given in Chapter 5.
There are literary works known as abecedarians in which the
sequence of Ô¨Årst letters spells out the alphabet. Acrostics of this
type appear in the Hebrew Bible in the Lamentations of Jeremiah
and some of the Psalms. In Psalm 119, for instance, the Ô¨Årst eight
verses all begin with aleph, the second eight with beth, the third
eight with gimel, and so on through the alphabet.10
The label ‚Äòacrostic‚Äô is also used for a type of crossword where you
Ô¨Åll in the answers not in a sequence across or down, but in a
number of designated positions scattered over the matrix. When
the puzzle is completed, words can be read either horizontally or
vertically. In the following example the Ô¨Årst clue is fancy and the
answer is whim, so you Ô¨Åll in w in the cell numbered 27, h in the
cell numbered 30, i in the 32 cell, and m in the 17 cell. The second
clue is chase and the answer is hunt, so you put h in the 22 cell, u in
the 38 cell, n in the 33 cell, and t in the 26 cell. I will leave the rest

Word Squares
A popular form of word play over the centuries has been forming
word squares, often referred to as magic squares, though that term
usually refers to a square containing numerals arranged so that the
sum of all columns and rows is the same. The word square can be
Ô¨Ålled in in any systematic way. In Figure 3 a simple example is

shown where the words star, tame, amen, and rent can be read
vertically as well as horizontally.
One kind of word square found in curse tablets from the
Greek and Roman worlds was a square (plinthion) formed by as
many repetitions of a word as there were letters, with each
repetition being offset from the previous one by one position.
The square in Figure 4 is from a curse addressed to the spirit
eulamoÃÑ seeking his aid in ruining the performance of rival
athletes (Gager 1992: 60).
The notion of a systematically Ô¨Ålled-in rectangle must have
been credited with some secret power, for word squares were
used in amulets as well as in curses. The square shown in Figure 5
is from a medieval amulet. It features one of the Hebrew
names of God, namely Eloh√Æm (zjela), which can be read by

starting in the middle with a (aleph) and proceeding to any
corner by any series of horizontal or vertical steps (Budge
1978: 234).
Squares made up of the consonants of Yahweh, namely efej
yhwh, the most sacred name of God, were also used.11
Heinrich
Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486‚Äì1535) in his De Occulta
Philosophia Libri Tres (Three Books on Occult Philosphy) describes a
medal with efej written in the form of a square and surrounded by
a wish. According to Agrippa, for the medal to be effective in
protecting the wearer it had to be made of pure gold or virgin
parchment. The ink had to be made from the smoke of a conse-
crated candle or incense mixed with holy water by an artist puriÔ¨Åed
from sin (Shumaker 1972: 149).
One square that has Ô¨Ågured prominently over the centuries in
discussions of word patterns is the sator square and it brings
together the palindrome, the acrostic, and the anagram. It is
illustrated in Figure 6. The words are Latin and they form a
palindrome: sator arepo tenet opera rotas. When aligned in
a square, they form a multiple acrostic so that words can be read
vertically as well as horizontally. Starting in the top left-hand

square one can read down the Ô¨Årst column (the initials), then the
second column, then the third, and so on. Moreover, all of this can
be done by starting in the bottom right-hand corner and reading
right to left or up each column in turn. The word arepo, an
anagram of opera, is otherwise unknown and is usually taken to
be a proper name, perhaps one that was made up to complete the
square. The translation would be ‚ÄòThe sower, Arepo, holds the
wheels with difÔ¨Åculty‚Äô, taking opera to be the ablative of opera
‚Äòpains, effort, exertion, labour‚Äô.
The oldest known example of a sator square is one excavated
from the ruins of Herculaneum, which, along with Pompeii, was
destroyed by an eruption of Vesuvius in 79 ad. Other examples
have been found from various parts of Europe including Scandi-
navia and Britain dating from the late Middle Ages and Renais-
sance. There are sator squares in the Runic alphabet and in the
Hebrew alphabet. It would appear to be just an ingenious novelty,
but it has been treated as having supernatural powers and has been
used, mainly as a text in an amulet, to ward off or heal the bite of a
rabid dog or snake, and to cure fever or toothache. Among the
Pennsylvania Dutch it was used to ward off cattle disease. Some
grimoires (handbooks of magic) recommend writing the words of
the square in blood and immersing them in holy water for use in

amulets. Along with various Christian prayers, the sator square was
also placed on the abdomen of a woman about to give birth
(McBryde 1907).
The square has been the subject of scores of learned papers,
mostly involving attempts to interpret it as a Christian message.
For example, it has been noted that there is an anagrammatic
relation with the Latin words pater noster ‚Äòour father‚Äô and the
letters a and o, which are equated with the Greek alpha and
omega as in ‚ÄòI am Alpha and Omega . . . ‚Äô (Rev.1:11). In order
to get the anagram to work you need to take paternoster and the
letters a and o twice, but use n only once. This can be achieved
by writing the words in the form of a cross with n doing double
duty at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines. This
arrangement is shown in Figure 7.
The sator square is certainly ingenious in the way it combines
the palindrome, the acrostic, and the anagram, though the use of
the apparently arbitrary name Arepo could be considered cheating.
Whether it was originally concocted with a serious purpose is
debatable. Certainly palindromes were popular in curses, perhaps,
as mentioned above, because they could not be reversed, but this
square came to be used as a charm rather than a curse. There is no
evidence that it has a Christian origin‚Äîin fact the early date of the
oldest example virtually precludes that possibility‚Äîbut attempts
to interpret it as Christian have been persistent. C.W. Ceram,
writer of popular books on archaeology, suggests reading the text
boustrophedon (i.e. left to right and right to left) and repeating
tenet. This yields Sator opera tenet and Tenet opera sator. Word
order is not critical in Latin and both sentences mean literally ‚ÄòThe
sower holds works‚Äô, which Ceram takes to refer to God. His
from anagrams to cryptic crosswords
29
suggestion echoes those of numerous others who have interpreted
the square as having Christian signiÔ¨Åcance.
The sator square remains popular in occult literature. In chapter
97 of Umberto Eco‚Äôs Foucault‚Äôs Pendulum a character appears
under the name Sator Arepo and is asked if he knows the Ô¨Ånal
answer behind the ‚ÄòSublime Anagram‚Äô. In chapter 113 an initiand
to a secret society is questioned Quid facit Sator Arepo? ‚ÄòWhat does
Sator Arepo do?‚Äô
Lipograms and Univocalics
Sometimes authors set out to compose texts where there are
constraints on which letters can be used. One such variety is the
lipogram, a text in which certain letters have been deliberately
avoided (Greek lipagrammatos ‚Äòmissing letter‚Äô). The earliest known
lipograms were written by a Greek lyric poet of the sixth century

bc, Lasus, who wrote several poems omitting sigma. Other ex-
amples exist in Greek and Roman literature as well as in modern
European languages and Persian. It is easy enough to compose a
text that omits low-frequency letters such as q, x, and z, but much
more difÔ¨Åcult to compose a text of any length omitting a high-
frequency letter, in particular a vowel. In English letter e presents
the ultimate challenge. It has the highest frequency of any letter
and is not only used on its own to represent a vowel, but also as a
silent letter in combination with other vowel letters in words such
as mate, mete, mite, mote, and mute.
Astonishing as it may seem, whole novels have been written
without using e. There is Ernest Vincent Wright‚Äôs 50,000-word
Gadsby (1939) and the French novel La Disparition ‚ÄòThe Disap-
pearance‚Äô (1969) by Georges Perec (1936‚Äì1982). An English trans-
lation of this work by Gilbert Adair is entitled A Void. While Perec
had to avoid the masculine form of the deÔ¨Ånite article in French
(le) and the plural (les), he could at least use the feminine (la), but
Adair could not use the.
Perec was a member of OuLiPo (Ouvroir de Litt√©rature Poten-
tielle, or ‚ÄòWorkshop of Potential Literature‚Äô), a Paris-based group
of writers founded in 1960 by Raymond Queneau and Fran√ßois
LeLionnais. Other well-known members were the Italian writer
Italo Calvino and the American Harry Matthews. OuLiPo tries to
expand literature by borrowing formal patterns from such other
domains as mathematics, logic, or chess. Perec‚Äôs own books range
from novels to collections of crossword puzzles, from essays to
parodies, from poetry to word games.
Mark Dunn‚Äôs Ella Minnow Pea is a story about a Ô¨Åctional island
nation off the southern Atlantic coast of the USA where there is a

31
monument to Nevin Nallop, the inventor of the pangram The
quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence was used by
the communications company Western Union for testing its
equipment because it contains all the letters of the alphabet. In
Dunn‚Äôs story the pangram appears on the base of the monument,
but with age letters progressively fall off, and as each one falls off
the government bans its use. Ella Minnow Pea originally bore the
subtitle ‚Äòa progressively lipogrammatic novel‚Äô, reÔ¨Çecting the fact
that as the government bans the use of more and more letters, the
letters are omitted from Dunn‚Äôs text.
James Thurber (1894‚Äì1961) wrote a novella for children
(and adults), The Wonderful O, about another island nation,
Ooroo, where pirates take over and ban the letter o. The island is
renamed R, coats become cats and poets pets. While Thurber‚Äôs text
is not lipogrammatic, the citizens of Ooroo (or R) are forced into
lipogrammaticy.
Some writers have attempted to compose prose or verse
texts using just one particular vowel. Such writings are called
univocalics. Perec followed his lipogrammatic novel with a
short univocalic work, Les Revenentes ‚ÄòThe ghosts‚Äô, in which e
was the only vowel used. (The normal spelling of revenent is
revenant.) Here is an example from an English work in which e is
the vowel.

Cryptic Crosswords
Anagrams, palindromes, acrostics, and riddles all come together in
the cryptic crossword. Practically every newspaper in western
countries carries at least one crossword puzzle. The Ô¨Årst crossword
was made up by a journalist, Arthur Wynne, and it appeared in a
Sunday paper called the New York World on 21 December 1913. A
decade later crosswords became a real craze, Ô¨Årst in the USA and
then in Britain. The early crosswords were of the simpler type
where the clues are synonymous words or phrases. By the mid-
twenties the cryptic type began to appear, in which the clues are
deliberately obscure and ambiguous, often with the least likely
reading being the correct one. Some of the early cryptic-crossword
compilers in Britain took their pseudonyms from some of the
infamous Grand Inquisitors of the Spanish Inquisition, Torque-
mada, the Ô¨Årst, Deza, the second (written backwards as Azed), and
Ximenes, the fourth.
Perhaps the most general principle used in cryptic crosswords is
that clues tend to refer to the sequence of letters that make up a
word rather than to the meaning. For instance, the clue might be
‚ÄòStop a left in headgear‚Äô. To get the answer, halt, you need to put ‚Äòl‚Äô
for ‚Äòleft‚Äô inside ‚Äòhat‚Äô, rather than looking for a word that means to
block a left (punch) with a hat or a cap.
Like the jokesmith, the crossword maker often employs puns
and other humorous devices. For instance, the clue for stalemate
might be ‚ÄòPerhaps partner of long standing‚Äô. In the eighteenth
century Dr Johnson was critical of an impoverished university for
being too lavish in distributing degrees, claiming that it was
from anagrams to cryptic crosswords
33
hoping to become rich by degrees. This is retold as a joke, but this
same pun can be found in cryptic crossword clues. One example I
came across was ‚Äòdrink gets to dances by degrees‚Äô, and the answer
was rumbas, i.e., rum (drink) plus BA degrees.
Sequences of letters are also broken up into meaningful
sequences irrespective of whether this division is etymologically
justiÔ¨Åed. A word like ‚Äòtablecloth‚Äô obviously consists of table and
cloth, but the crossword compilers will break ‚Äòpenchant‚Äô into
pen-chant and ‚Äòtarpaulin‚Äô into tar-paul-in if it suits them. The
clue for penchant might be ‚ÄòInclination to write song‚Äô, and the
clue for tarpaulin might be ‚ÄòPitch man in for cover‚Äô. Crossword
makers are also likely to ignore word boundaries if it suits
them. The sequence of letters in the word therapist can be
broken into the rapist. The clue might be ‚Äòpsychologist who
harms women‚Äô.
The crossword, whether cryptic or simple, employs at least one
point of linguistic knowledge, namely letter frequency. A cunning
crossword compiler manages to put the less common letters
such as k, q, and x between black squares rather than at word
intersections, since knowing the position of one of these letters is a
big help to the solver.
Here are a few more tricks of the trade:
‚Ä¢ Finding ‚Äòwords‚Äô within words. Leastwise looks as if it means ‚Äòvery
foolish‚Äô, so the clue might be ‚ÄòVery silly, however‚Äô. Laterally looks like
‚Äòlate rally‚Äô. The clue could be ‚ÄòDelayed court exchange on the sides‚Äô.
Restrain could be broken into rest and rain, so the clue might be ‚ÄòHold
back the remainder before the shower‚Äô. Sometimes just part of a word
might be identiÔ¨Åed as a word; for instance, the Ô¨Årst three letters of
catalogue could be identiÔ¨Åed with ‚Äòcat‚Äô. A Melbourne hardware chain
secret language
34
does this in its advertising. It includes a dog in its commercials and
refers to its dogalogue rather than catalogue.
‚Ä¢ Puns are common. A clue might be ‚ÄòShort period of enchantment‚Äô
and the answer would be spell. The answers are often phrases. The clue
might be ‚ÄòFree and naked‚Äô and the answer would be Have nothing on.
‚Ä¢ Anagrams are very popular in cryptic crosswords. The presence of
an anagram is usually signalled by words such as muddled, confused,
scrambled, or simply out or off. The answer to the clue ‚ÄòIs the map-
room‚Äôs shape changing?‚Äô is metamorphosis, which is an anagram of ‚ÄòIs
the map-room‚Äôs‚Äô. The word changing does double duty since it
indicates the presence of an anagram and supplies the meaning.
‚Ä¢ Palindromes crop up too. A clue such as ‚Äòraise in either direction
(3,2)‚Äô would yield put up.
‚Ä¢ Semordnilaps also feature. A clue such as ‚Äòrodents return to light up
the sky (4)‚Äô would yield star (from rats).
‚Ä¢ Acrostics are also used. A clue such as ‚ÄòThe artist starting the
entertainment began with discernment‚Äô (5) yields taste. The terms
‚Äòodds‚Äô and ‚Äòevens‚Äô often refer to the sequence of odd numbered or
even numbered letters in neighbouring words. The clue ‚Äòodd spouse
in trouble‚Äô would give SOS, i.e. the Ô¨Årst, third, and Ô¨Åfth letters of
spouse.
‚Ä¢ Words such as ‚Äòleader‚Äô and ‚Äòhead‚Äô often refer to an initial, so
‚Äòringleader‚Äô might refer to ‚Äòr‚Äô, the initial of ‚Äòring‚Äô, and ‚Äòairhead‚Äô is to
be interpreted as ‚Äòa‚Äô, the head of ‚Äòair‚Äô. The clue ‚Äòairhead in bright
chopper‚Äô might thus yield the answer cleaver. ‚ÄòBright‚Äô is clever, and if
you put a in it you can get cleaver, which is a chopper. Note that in
refers to the sequence of letters. Of course you can‚Äôt take this for
granted. The clue could also refer to something being in a chopper,
with chopper referring to a helicopter.
‚Ä¢ The expression ‚Äònothing‚Äô can refer to the letter o. The clue ‚Äòmud-
dled bassets get nothing for deadly dust‚Äô is to be interpreted as an
anagram of bassets plus an o, to yield asbestos. Other ways of referring
to letter o are ‚Äòlove‚Äô (zero in tennis), ‚Äòduck‚Äô (zero in cricket), ‚Äòround‚Äô, or
‚Äòcircle‚Äô.
from anagrams to cryptic crosswords
35
‚Ä¢ Words such as ‚Äòclipping‚Äô or ‚Äòbeheading‚Äô can refer to the removal of
letters to produce another word. For instance, the clue ‚Äòa creature
beheaded and still healthy‚Äô produces the answer hale. You have to
come up with whale as the creature and then behead the word.
‚Ä¢ Words such as ‚Äòedges‚Äô, ‚Äòlimits‚Äô, and ‚Äòextremes‚Äô often refer to the Ô¨Årst
and last letters of a word. ‚ÄòExtremes of bamboo smell‚Äô could be a clue
for BO (body odour). The answer to the clue ‚ÄòTraveller ends Ô¨Årst
inspection through petty details‚Äô is to be built up by taking tr (the
letters at the ends of traveller), i (the ‚ÄòÔ¨Årst‚Äô letter in inspection), plus via
‚Äòthrough‚Äô to yield trivia ‚Äòpetty details‚Äô. Words like ‚Äòfront‚Äô and ‚Äòend‚Äô
refer to the Ô¨Årst and last letters of a word respectively. Thus ‚ÄòPopular
Front‚Äô might refer to p, and ‚Äòend of world‚Äô might refer to d.
‚Ä¢ Words like ‚Äòmiddle‚Äô and ‚Äòcentral‚Äô often refer to letters in the middle
of a word. ‚ÄòThe middle of the month in the wager is crooked‚Äô could be
a clue for bent (n, the middle letter of month, in bet, a synonym for
‚Äòwager‚Äô).
‚Ä¢ Where a sequence of letters is indicated by the clue, these letters
might not occur together. For instance, in the clue ‚ÄòVery quietly edge
in and deck out‚Äô for primp, one has to put rim (edge) inside pp
(pianissimo, see below).
‚Ä¢ Words such as ‚Äòreturning‚Äô or ‚Äògoing back‚Äô usually refer to taking a
sequence of letters and reversing them. The clue ‚Äòa star eager to get
back‚Äô yields diva. You have to think of the word avid and then reverse
it.
‚Ä¢ Words like ‚Äòin‚Äô often refer to the answer being contained within a
word or phrase. For instance, ‚ÄòSouth American race found in castle‚Äô
might be a clue for Inca (in-ca(stle)).
‚Ä¢ Where the answer is a homophone, the clue will often include
words like ‚Äòsounds like‚Äô. For instance, ‚ÄòQueen‚Äôs rule sounds as if it
might break drought‚Äô would give rain (sounds like reign).
‚Ä¢ Letters are often designated by roman numerals: IV (4), V (5), VI
(6), IX (9), X (10), XI (11), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000).
‚Ä¢ The crossword compiler needs ways of referring to particular letters
and common sequences of letters. Here are some conventional
secret language
36
methods. In the case of the Ô¨Årst entry (and other similar ones) the
sequence ‚Äòa French‚Äô will normally be part of the wording of the clue.
For instance, the clue might be ‚Äòa French frock to take off‚Äô and the
answer undress (un-dress).
a French un(e)
a German ein(e)
artist ra (Royal Academician)
circle o

TALKING IN RIDDLES
For words, like Nature, half reveal
And half conceal the soul within.
TENNYSON, IN MEMORIAM V
Riddles
The Nature of the Riddle
In present times we tend to treat riddles as a form of light
amusement to be found in Christmas crackers or in books of
jokes aimed at children. However, in the traditional literatures of
Europe and most of Asia solving riddles was one of the heroic
challenges, along with feats of physical strength. This tradition is
carried on in some modern Ô¨Åction. In Dan Brown‚Äôs popular novel
The Da Vinci Code the hero is presented with a riddle that asks him
to Ô¨Ånd ‚Äòthe orb on the tomb of a knight the pope interred‚Äô. The
pope is Alexander Pope, who wrote a eulogy for the knight,
41
Sir Isaac Newton, and the orb is the apple, which Newton is
supposed to have used in the experiments which led to his theory
of gravity. The hero realizes the answer to the riddle is apple. This
supplies the combination to the alphabetical lock on a cryptex, a
cylinder containing a message.
In many societies riddling is a form of verbal art practised by
adults, often in community riddling sessions, and riddles are
frequently serious rather than comic. They Ô¨Ågure among the
traditional store of wisdom and have a function analogous to
proverbs such as An apple a day keeps the doctor away, A stitch in
time saves nine, or Waste not, want not. Riddles are reported from
all parts of the world, though examples from Australia are scanty.
In some societies riddles are put to inductees in initiation rites; in
others riddles are exchanged at wakes (Burns 1976: 143). Prophets
often speak in riddles or use vague or equivocal language, which
makes it easier for them to claim to have been misinterpreted if
their predictions go unfulÔ¨Ålled.
The oldest examples of riddles we know of are Sumerian and
date back to the third millennium bc, but given that children
begin to play with language as soon as they have mastered it,
I would suggest that humans probably did the same once they
had acquired language, and that riddles have a long ancestry which
predates written records.
The following example is a prototypical riddle in our culture:
What has eyes, but cannot see?
A potato.
A typical riddle contains at its heart an unspeciÔ¨Åed subject or
topic about which information is supplied in an obscure, often
42
secret language
metaphorical form. Here the metaphor lies in the use of eyes,
whose primary reference is organs of sight, for the shoots on the
surface of a potato, an example of polysemy. In this riddle, as in
many, there is an apparent contradiction, because we naturally
take eyes in its primary sense. The contradiction is resolved by the
answer, which allows us to see that eyes has been used in its
extended sense (Georges and Dundes 1963: 112; Taylor 1943: 130).
The next riddle also appears to contain contradictions. It is
spoken by a watch, and the contradictions arise from the alterna-
tion between go and stop used in their primary sense and with
reference to a watch operating or not operating.
I went to Turkey, and I stopped there, and I never went there,
and I came back again.
This example also illustrates two common features of riddles not
found in what for us is the prototypical riddle. First, it is in
statement form. A question may be added (What am I?) or just
left implicit in the context. Secondly, the subject is personiÔ¨Åed and
speaks in the Ô¨Årst person.
Sometimes a riddle will be introduced by a conventional for-
mula. In English the line Riddle me, riddle me, ree is often used to
introduce a riddle in rhyme. The following riddle refers to some
kind of berry.
Riddle me, riddle me ree,
A little man in a tree;
A stick in his hand,
A stone in his throat,
If you read me this riddle
I‚Äôll give you a groat.
43
talking in riddles
Such formulas are found in African cultures. Among the Lamba,
for instance, the riddler invites someone to try and answer a riddle
by saying Tyo, which means ‚ÄòGuess the riddle‚Äô. Acceptance of the
game is expressed in the phrase Ka kesa ‚ÄòLet it come‚Äô or Ka mu leta
‚ÄòBring it‚Äô (Harries 1971: 381). Among the Mbeere of Kenya the
riddler asks Gwata ndaƒ±
~ ‚ÄòCatch this riddle‚Äô and one accepts the
challenge by replying Nagwata ‚ÄòI catch‚Äô (Glazier and Glazier 1976:
192). In Vietnamese the optional formula to introduce a riddle is
ƒê
^
o X ‚ÄòI challenge you, X‚Äô and the optional question that follows is
L√† c√°i g√¨? ‚ÄòWhat is it?‚Äô (Nha Trang Pensinger 2001).
Although a typical riddle involves metaphor, it is possible to
have a riddle that is literal, and which relies on the fact that
particular properties can be common to a number of referents.
The lines of the following riddle (which refers to a blackberry or
bramble) can be taken literally, but there is a partial change of
subject after line one. The white Ô¨Çowers are the subject of line one,
whereas in the other three lines subject is the fruit: successively
green, red, and black.
First I am as white as snow,
Then as green as grass I grow,
Next I am as red as blood,
Lastly I‚Äôm as black as mud.
One of the oldest recorded riddles is found in the Bible (Judges
14:14). After killing a young lion with his bare hands, Samson saw
that bees had swarmed and built a hive in the carcass, so he
proposed the following riddle to the Philistines:
Out of the eater came something to eat;
out of the strong came something sweet.
44
secret language
Like the blackberry riddle, this riddle does not depend on meta-
phor, but on vagueness. ‚ÄòThe eater‚Äô could be any creature that eats;
‚Äòsomething to eat‚Äô could be anything edible, and so on. There is
really no way anyone who had not seen the honey in the lion could
have solved the riddle, but the Philistines obtained the answer
from Samson‚Äôs wife, Delilah.
The blackberry example and the translation of Samson‚Äôs riddle
also illustrate another feature of riddles, namely that they often
have formal properties such as metre and rhyme. The most com-
mon type of verse found in Vietnamese riddles has a line of six
monosyllables followed by a line of eight monosyllables with a
rhyme between the last syllable of the Ô¨Årst line and the sixth one of
the second line. In Vietnamese almost all words are monosyllabic
or consist of combinations of monosyllables. The answer to the
following example is a coconut (Nha Trang Pensinger 2001):
S√¥ng kh√¥ng ƒë
^
en, b
^
en kh√¥ng v√†o
Lo‚Äô lu‚Äông giu
~
‚Äôa tr√≤‚Äôi l√†m sao c√≥ nu‚Äô√≥‚Äôc?
It neither goes to a river nor comes to shore,
It is suspended in air, but somehow has water in it.
In the EÔ¨Åk language of Nigeria and Cameroon there are proverb-like
riddles(seeexampleonp.59)in whichtheanswernormallyechoesthe
tonal pattern of the question (Simmons 1958) and in the older Ger-
manic languages riddles were in alliterative verse (illustrated on p. 53).
Some riddles have a pattern of parallel statements rather than metre or
rhyme, as in thefollowing riddle describing a cofÔ¨Ån (Taylor 1943: 133):
The man that make it, he don‚Äôt use it.
The man that buy it, he don‚Äôt use it.
The man that use it, he don‚Äôt know it.
45
talking in riddles
There are two types of riddle found in Europe that are not
common elsewhere. One is a riddle that depends on a pun or word
play in the answer rather than a metaphor in the question. This
type is sometimes called a conundrum.
Why did the ram go straight ahead?
Because he didn‚Äôt see the ewe turn.
What did Mrs Cook say when Captain Cook died?
That‚Äôs the way the cookie crumbles.
Why did the Ô¨Çy Ô¨Çy?
Because the spider spied ‚Äôer.
Why do ducks go under water ?
For divers reasons.
The other type simply demands clear thinking.
A man looks at a portrait and says the following:
Brothers and sisters have I none,
But that man‚Äôs father is my father‚Äôs son.
Whose portrait is he looking at?
Indian riddles frequently incorporate word play, perhaps
not surprisingly given that traditional Indian literature is full
of puns and so forth. In the collection of Amir Khusro (1253‚Äì
1325), for instance, we Ô¨Ånd examples like the following one where
the answer, namely na:khu:n ‚ÄòÔ¨Ånger- and toe-nails‚Äô, appears within
the riddle itself as the sequence na:khu:n (Vatuk 1969: 145).
bi:s~
o ka: sir ka:t
: diya:
twenty of head cut off
na: ma:ra: na: khu:n kiya:
not killed nor blood made.
46
secret language
The heads of twenty were cut off,
There was no killing or bloodshed.
In another type two languages are used, Persian in the Ô¨Årst line and
Hindi in the second. The answer is sada:, which can be interpreted
as sada: ‚Äòvoice‚Äô in Persian and sada: ‚Äòalways‚Äô in Hindi (Vatuk
1969: 148).
Quvat-e ru:h ci:st
strength of.soul what.is
Pya:ri ko kab dekhiye
beloved to when should.see
What is the strength of the soul? sada: the voice
When should one see one‚Äôs beloved? sada: always
Most riddles are part of oral culture, but in a literate society it is
possible for riddles to depend on the written form. In English, for
instance, there are riddles such as, ‚ÄòWhat does it take to turn a lad
into a lady?‚Äô The answer is ‚Äòy‚Äô (Green and Pepicello 1980: 26).1
Riddles for Heroes
The ancient literature of Europe and Asia is full of stories where
heroes are asked to solve riddles or compete in solving riddles. It is
not certain that riddles were ever posed to heroes in real life, but
Maranda (1976: 127), quoting Ganander in Aenigmata Fennica,
mentions that in the past in Finland suitors were required to
answer three riddles to prove themselves worthy of winning the

For more complete discussion about deÔ¨Åning and classifying riddles,
see, for instance, Burns 1976; Georges and Dundes 1963; Green and
Pepicello 1984; Hamnett 1967; Maranda 1976; and Taylor 1943.

maiden of their choice. In chapter 6 of The Banquet of the Seven
Sages Plutarch mentions a story about the king of Ethiopia chal-
lenging the king of Egypt to solve a riddle in a contest for territory
that lay between the two kingdoms, and the Byzantine scholar
Maximus Planudes (1260‚Äì1330) relates a duel of riddles in his Life
of Aesop between Lycerus, king of Babylon, and Nectanebo, king
of Egypt. There is also a story that the oracle at Thebes posed the
following riddle to anyone arriving in the city:
What animal is it that in the morning goes on four feet, at noon
on two, and in the evening upon three?
As the story goes, the riddle remained unsolved for years and all who
attempted to solve it and failed were devoured by the Sphinx. When
Oedipus arrived, he solved the riddle, pointing out that it referred to
a human, who crawls on four limbs as a baby, walks on two legs as
an older child and adult, and uses a walking stick in old age.
In the folklore of Europe and Asia maidens are often protected
by riddles. There is an example Puccini‚Äôs opera Turandot, the
libretto of which comes from a Persian collection of stories, The
Thousand and One Days, via an adaption by Schiller. The story also
exempliÔ¨Åes the power of a name, which is further illustrated in
Chapter 7.
A prince of Tartary falls in love with an icy-hearted Chinese
princess, Turandot (originally Turan-dokht ‚Äòdaughter of Turan‚Äô
with dokht being cognate with English daughter), but to be
successful a suitor must answer three riddles. Suitors who fail
are beheaded. Undaunted the prince accepts the challenge. To
the Ô¨Årst of Turandot‚Äôs riddles, ‚ÄòWhat is born each night and dies
at dawn?‚Äô, the prince answers, ‚ÄòHope‚Äô. To the second riddle,
‚ÄòWhat Ô¨Çickers red and warm like a Ô¨Çame, but is not Ô¨Åre?‚Äô, the
48
secret language
prince answers, ‚ÄòBlood‚Äô. The third riddle is ‚ÄòWhat is like ice, but
burns like Ô¨Åre?‚Äô The prince answers, ‚ÄòTurandot‚Äô. All three answers
are correct. Turandot, who has made up the three supposedly
unanswerable riddles to protect herself from men, is horriÔ¨Åed and
begs to be let off, and the prince offers her a way out. If she can
Ô¨Ånd out his name by sunrise, he will forfeit his life. Morning
comes and Turandot has not found out the prince‚Äôs name. She
must marry him. But when the prince kisses her, she begins to
feel stirrings of love. The prince reveals that his name is Calaf, son
of Timur, thus placing his life in Turandot‚Äôs hands and relying on
her new-found feelings of love to save him. Fortunately his
gamble pays off.2
A heroine protected by riddles can be found in the Latin novella
The History of Apollonius, Prince of Tyre, though the young woman
in this instance is not a maiden. The story was popular in the
Middle Ages and was incorporated into several works, including
Gower‚Äôs Confessio Amantis. In the story King Antiochus carries on
an incestuous relationship with his daughter and keeps suitors at
bay by proposing a riddle that they must solve if they wish to
marry her. If they fail, they are beheaded. The riddle is
Scelere vehor, maternam carnem vescor.
I am carried away by crime. I feed on maternal Ô¨Çesh.3
Apollonius solves the riddle. He says to the king, ‚ÄòWhen you say,
‚ÄúI am carried away by crime‚Äù, look to yourself, and when you say,
2
In the original story a servant tricks Calaf into revealing his name.
3
There is in fact a further line to the riddle, which is obscure, namely,
Quaero patrem meum, meae matris virum, uxoris meae Ô¨Åliam: non invenio
‚ÄòI look for my father, the husband of my mother, the daughter of my wife
and I Ô¨Ånd not‚Äô. Note also that vescor would have taken an ablative
complement not an accusative one in classical Latin.
49
talking in riddles
‚ÄúI feed on maternal Ô¨Çesh‚Äù, look to your daughter‚Äô. Antiochus does
not play fair. He tells Apollonius that he is wrong and sends
someone to kill him.
In the Norse sagas characters are often faced not only with physical
trials but also with riddles. In Hervarar Saga ok Hei√∞reks King
Heithrek swears that if an accused man can ask a riddle he cannot
answer, the man will go free. One such accused is Gestumblindi,
who makes a sacriÔ¨Åce to Odin (√ì√∞inn) seeking his help. Odin
appears to him in the guise of Gestumblindi and the two change
clothes. Odin presents himself before the king as Gestumblindi and
proceeds to ask the king a number of riddles. Two of these are given
below. The subject of the Ô¨Årst is a spider and of the second a die or
dice. The letters √æ (thorn) and √∞ (eth) are both to be read as th in this
and in subsequent examples from Old Norse and Old English.
Hvat er √æat undra, What is the wonder

ok fylgja √æv√≠ margir mj√∂k? And much depends on it?
Hei√∞rekr konungr, King Heidrik,
hygg√∞u at g√°tu. Guess the riddle.
50
secret language
The king answers all the riddles put to him, and in the end Odin,
in frustration, asks a question to which only he can know the
answer, namely, ‚ÄòWhat did Odin whisper in Balder‚Äôs ear before
Balder was placed on his funeral pyre?‚Äô At this the king realizes the
riddler must be Odin himself, so he draws his sword and attempts
to kill him. Odin escapes by turning himself into a falcon, though
the king manages to hack off his tail feathers.
European Riddles
Riddles in verse were popular with the Greeks and later with the
Romans. Cleobulina of Rhodes (also known as Eumetis), who
lived in the sixth century bc, was famous for her riddles or enigmas
(√ÜY√ò¬™√Ü	√Ü) in hexameter verse. In chapter 6 of Plutarch‚Äôs Banquet
of the Seven Sages, she responds to Aesop‚Äôs question about what
people would think if pipe-makers used asses‚Äô bones in place of
bones of fawns with a riddle about the unlikelihood of the bones of
an ass, a gross animal, being suitable for harmony.
Some classical riddles incorporate other forms of word play. The
following is a palindrome.
In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni.
It means ‚ÄòInto the circle we go by night and are consumed by the
Ô¨Åre‚Äô. There is no metaphor, just a lack of explicit subject. The
answer has not been recorded but is probably moths.
In the following example the subject is a palindrome, namely
ƒÅra ‚Äòaltar‚Äô. Note that this palindrome would not hold for classical
spoken Latin since the Ô¨Årst vowel is long and the second short. It
works in later Latin, where the length distinction had been lost,
and it works in the spelling since vowel length was not represented.

Si me retro legis, dicam tibi semper id ipsum.
Una mihi facies ante retroque manet.
If you read me backwards, I say ever the same.
I present one face forwards and backwards.
In the following example the subject is the proper name Eva,
which can be reversed to yield the imperative verb form ave ‚Äòhail‚Äô.
Si me retro legis, faciam de nomine verbum.
Femina cum fuerim, imperativus ero.
If you read me backwards, I shall make a verb from a noun.
Feminine I was, imperative I shall be.4
There is a collection of a hundred Latin riddles or Aenigmata by an
otherwise unknown author, Caelius Firmianus Symphonius, prob-
ably of the fourth or Ô¨Åfth century, perhaps earlier. These consist of
three lines of Latin hexameters, with elegant and clever phrasing (Ohl
1928). The subject of each is given, so they do not seem like riddles.

Littera me pavit, nec quid sit littera novi;

These examples are taken from the introduction by Elizabeth Peck

M√ºller in a manuscript of Ausonius, a fourth-century Latin poet.

These were popular in the late Roman empire and the Middle
Ages and some of them were incorporated in the History of
Apollonius of Tyre mentioned above.
Riddles remained a major form of entertainment in the Middle
Ages. In England, Bede (673‚Äì735) composed riddles, as did
his contemporaries Boniface, Hw√¶tberht, and Tatwine (or St
Tatwin). There is also a collection of riddles by Aldhelm
(640‚Äì709), abbott of Malmesbury and later bishop of Sherborne,
a collection that owes a great deal to Symphonius. All these writers
wrote in Latin. Our knowledge of riddles in Old English comes
from a collection of ninety-odd riddles in a manuscript known as
The Exeter Book, written around the end of the tenth century
(Williamson 1977). They range in length from one line to over a
hundred. They are all in the common verse mode of the time,
namely alliterative verse with two stresses to the half-line and at
least one alliteration between the half-lines. Here is a short riddle
on the same subject as the one from Symphonius quoted above.
The title is not stated, but with mo√∞√∞e ‚Äòmoth‚Äô in line one and
wyrm ‚Äòworm‚Äô in line three, there is little left for the reader to
work out.
Mo√∞√∞e word fr√¶t. Me √æ√¶t √æuhte
wr√¶tlicu wyrd, √æa ic √æ√¶t wundor gefr√¶gn,
√æ√¶t se wyrm forswealg wera gied sumes,

ond √æ√¶s strangan sta√æol. St√¶lgiest ne w√¶s

Words the moth ate, and it seemed to me
A curious deed, when that wonder I heard,
That the worm swallowed up the words of a man
53
talking in riddles
Thief in the night, his glorious speech
And its strong support. The thieving stranger
Was no whit the wiser for the words he swallowed.
Such obscurity as there is derives from ambiguity in words. The
bookworm eats the physical words, the parchment and ink, but we
normally understand words as meaningful elements drawn from
the mental lexicon. As we saw in the previous chapter, this kind of
ambiguity is also the stock in trade of the composer of cryptic
crosswords.
Most of the riddles in The Exeter Book are serious. One of them
poses a question at length, which is along the lines, ‚ÄòWhat is that
wonder that wanders through the world, bringing weeping, some-
thing no creature can escape?‚Äô The answer is, in summary, ‚ÄòAge is
on earth altogether mighty, destroying everything, biting iron with
rust and doing the same to us‚Äô. Another in the Ô¨Årst person
describes the life of a piece of animal skin that becomes a page of
the Bible. It is soaked, deprived of its hair, covered in the tracks of
a bird‚Äôs pride (a quill pen), and bound. In its Ô¨Ånal state it offers
wisdom and virtue.
Some of the riddles in The Exeter Book have two interpretations,
one respectable and the other bawdy. Riddle XXV can be taken to
refer to an onion, but there is an X-rated alternative.
Ic eom wunderlicu wiht, wifum on hyhte,

A wonder am I to women a joy,
To neighbours a need. To none
Bearing ill save one who‚Äôd kill.
In the bed I stand tall and straight,
But rough below. Sometimes dares
A wilful woman grab me she will,
Raze me red, ravage my head,
Clench me close. She‚Äôll suffer soon
From meeting with me and beating me,
*Wounden-locked woman will get a wet eye.
*wound as in wound up, i.e. plaited or braided
Vulgar ambiguity like this is common in riddles. In this case the
respectable answer may came to mind Ô¨Årst, but in many cases the
vulgar interpretation is the Ô¨Årst to suggest itself. The innocent
answer may then be given in an attempt to embarrass the person to
whom the riddle has been posed. For instance, a common con-
temporary riddle asks What is it a man can do standing, a woman
sitting down, and a dog on three legs? The obvious response is
‚Äòurinate‚Äô, but the answer is ‚Äòshake hands‚Äô.
Educational texts in the Middle Ages were often in the form of
a dialogue between teacher and student, and riddles appear in
some of these dialogues. One such text is from the English
scholar Alcuin (Ealhwine c.735‚Äì804), who was invited to the
court of Charlemagne and among other duties acted as mentor
to Charlemagne‚Äôs second son, Pepin (Pippinus). It is a dialogue
between Alcuin and Pepin in most of which Alcuin answers
55
talking in riddles
questions with kennings. Kennings are compounds such as
whale-road for ‚Äòsea‚Äô or phrases describing an object, a creature,
or some phenomenon. These kennings are not always transpar-
ent and they often have a riddle-like quality. Here they are given
as answers to questions. In other words these pairs of question
and answer are like riddles in reverse with the obscurity in the
answer.
P. Quid est aer? A. Custodia vitae.
What is breath? The guard of life.
P. Quid est vita? A. Beatorum laetitia, miserorum
moestitia, exspectatio mortis.
What is life? The joy of the blessed, the grief
of the unhappy, a waiting for death.
P. Quid est mors? A. Inevitabilis eventus, incerta
peregrinatio, lacrimae viventium
testamenti Ô¨Årmamentum, latro
hominis.
What is death? An inevitable outcome, an
uncertain journey, the tears of the
living, the fulÔ¨Ålling of the will,
the thief of Man.
P. Quid est luna? A. Oculus noctis, roris larga,
praesaga tempestatum.
What is the moon? The eye of night, the giver of
dew, the prophet of the weather.
In the following example, however, Alcuin presents Pepin with
a riddle, and Pepin answers with a kenning. The referent is an
arrow. The word feminam ‚Äòfemale‚Äô refers to the feminine gender of
the Latin sagitta.
56

A. Vidi feminam volantem, rostrum habentem ferreum, et corpus
ligneum et caudam pennatam, mortem portantem.
I saw a something female Ô¨Çying with an iron beak, a wooden

P. Socia militum.
A soldier‚Äôs ally.
Riddles became popular in France and England in the seven-
teenth century. They were usually in verse and the emphasis
was on elegance of expression. Here is an example from Jona-
than Swift (1667‚Äì1745). The subject is obviously the moon.
Note in passing that in Swift‚Äôs time quarter could still rhyme
with Tartar, the Ô¨Årst vowel not having acquired rounding from
the preceding [w].
I with borrowed silver shine,
What you see is none of mine.
First I show you but a quarter,
Like the bow that guards the Tartar;
Then the half, and then the whole,
Ever dancing round the pole;
And true it is, I chieÔ¨Çy owe
My beauty to the shades below.
Non-European Riddles
As noted at the beginning of the chapter, riddles are found in
numerous cultures around the world. Outside Europe most riddles
are instructive rather than amusing. They are often proverb-like,
and like proverbs they belong to a familiar repertoire and com-
monly play a prominent part in community gatherings. One
person might pose the question and the audience give the answer,
57
talking in riddles
though the terms ‚Äòquestion‚Äô and ‚Äòanswer‚Äô are not always appropri-
ate, as can be seen from the examples below.
In sub-Saharan Africa riddles are an important cultural form.
Most riddles are from a traditional repertoire so the addressee is
not set the task of trying to decode the riddle. Even where a new
riddle is invented, the solution is offered (Messenger 1960: 226). In
one type found among the Nyanga of the Congo, a proverbial-
style utterance is followed by an explanation in Ô¨Åxed form (Harries
1971: 389).5
Who desires a beauty clothes her.
That is to say, however plain she may be, they will desire the
woman you clothe.
I take the ‚Äòexplanation‚Äô to mean that a plain woman can be made
desirable by appropriate clothing and accessories.
Among the Anang of southeastern Nigeria there are similar
riddles. The example below begins with an apparent reference to
a pepper tree, but the reference is metaphorical (Messenger
1960: 230).
The pepper tree growing next to the well does not bear ripe fruit.
Women from Obonukwa do not marry because they have ‚Äòstrong
head‚Äô.
People passing to and from a well will pluck the peppers from any
tree growing near the well and eat them, not allowing them to mature
into desirable spicy fruit. The village of Obonukwa lies on the border
of Ibo territory and the Anang believe the women have picked up bad

No introductory frame is used with these Nyanga pairs, and for that
reason Harries does not consider them as riddles (Harries 1971: 388).
58
secret language
Ibo habits such as indulging in pre-marital sexual relations. They are
plucked prematurely and do not grow into desirable fruit.
In the next example the relationship between the two parts is
not apparent without extra information (Messenger 1960: 228).
A piece of Ô¨Årewood burns.
Darkness brings evil thoughts.
There is an analogy between a piece of Ô¨Årewood continuing to
burn into the night and evil thoughts that arise when one lies
down to sleep. These thoughts are attributed to evil spirits, and the
proverb is a warning to be on guard against such spirits.
A similar type is found among the EÔ¨Åk (Simmons 1958: 130).
Pepper burns my throat.
The world loved me when I was a child.
An immature pepper can be chewed whole, but a ripe pepper is
spicy and used only as a condiment. Children are sweet and treated
well, but old people are not always treated so well.
Among the Dusun of Borneo riddles play a traditional part in
educating the young, rather as proverbs do for us. The one below
concerns the sacriÔ¨Åce for a divination ritual (Williams 1963b: 151,
Riddle 58).
Q. White is the goat and black is the pig.
No use for one to die,
The two virgins must die together.
A. The pig and the goat must die together to make the ritual right.
The next one teaches about the role of the headman in settling
disputes (Williams 1963b: 141, Riddle 3). The answer is phrased in
59
talking in riddles
general terms, but in the context of local culture it would be
understood as meaning the headman.
Q. The cloth is unravelled and no one can mend it but Iangkutide,
who spends a day repairing it.
A. One who settles cases at law.
The Rebus
A rebus is a representation using pictures or icons instead of words.
The word rebus comes from the Latin expression Non verbis sed rebus
‚ÄòNot by words, but by things‚Äô. The earliest systems of writing, which
developed in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Central America, all
started with pictograms such as a drawing of a hill to represent a hill
or an ideogram such as a pair of legs to represent the notion of
walking or going. Obviously most words do not lend themselves to
these methods of representation, so pictograms and ideograms came
to be used for syllables or words that sounded the same as words that
had a pictorial representation. An example in English would be to
represent lionize by a pictogram of a lion and a pictogram of two eyes,
exploiting homophony between lion- and lion, and between -ize and
eyes. A representation of this type is a rebus.6
Since the Middle Ages the rebus has been popular in heraldry, a
process known as canting. Nicholas Breakspeare (1100‚Äì1159), who
became Pope Adrian IV, had a broken spear in his coat of arms.
One family with the surname Bowes had bows that you tie in
theirs, and another family with the same name had bows of the
kind that shoot arrows. The late mother of the present queen of

See ch. 10 of Blake 2008.

England was born Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon and her coat of arms
contains bows (of the shooting type) and lions. The coat of arms of
Princess Beatrice of York retains part of this motif with an overlay
of three bees (bee-trice).
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries rebuses were popular
in books of word puzzles and the like. Over the last decade or so it
has become popular to send messages by mobile phone, a context
in which brevity is at a premium. Lots of abbreviations are used, as
is the rebus principle in using C for ‚Äòsee‚Äô, U for ‚Äòyou‚Äô, 2 for ‚Äòto‚Äô, 4
for ‚Äòfor‚Äô, and 8 for ‚Äòate‚Äô or more often for the syllable -ate in words
like later, so that See you later could be texted as CUL8R.
The Charade
A development of the elegant verse riddle was the charade, in
which clues were given to the letters or syllables of a word rather
than to the complete referent. Here is an interesting early example
from Swift‚Äôs one-time lover, Esther Vanhomrigh (c.1688‚Äì1723).7
It
has something of the rebus about it in that it Ô¨Ånds homophones for
the syllables of Jonathan Swift in the Ô¨Årst three lines.
Cut the name of the man who his mistress denied,
And let the Ô¨Årst of it be only applied Joseph ! Jo
To join with the prophet who David did chide; Nathan
Then say what a horse is that runs very fast, Swift
And that which deserves to be Ô¨Årst put the last; Put the
adjective last
7
Swift gave Esther Vanhomrigh the name Vanessa, which he made up
by taking the Ô¨Årst syllables of her surname and given name and adding the
feminine ending.
61

Spell all then, and put them together, to Ô¨Ånd
The name and the virtues of him I designed.
Like the patriarch in Egypt, he‚Äôs versed in the state;
Like the prophet in Jewry, he‚Äôs free with the great;
Like a racer he Ô¨Çies, to succour with speed,
When his friends want his aid or desert is in need.
Charades became popular in England in the late eighteenth
century. Here is perhaps the most-quoted example. It is by Catherine
Maria Fanshawe (1765‚Äì1834), and it refers to the letter H.
‚ÄôTwas whispered in Heaven, ‚Äôtwas muttered in Hell,
And echo caught faintly the sound as it fell;
On the conÔ¨Ånes of Earth, ‚Äòtwas permitted to rest,
And in the depths of the ocean its presence confessed;
‚ÄòTwill be found in the sphere when ‚Äôtis riven asunder,
Be seen in the lightning and heard in the thunder;
‚ÄôTwas allotted to man with his earliest breath,
Attends him at birth and awaits him at death,
Presides o‚Äôer his happiness, honor and health,
Is the prop of his house and the end of his wealth.
In the heaps of the miser, ‚Äòtis hoarded with care,
But is sure to be lost on his prodigal heir;
It begins every hope, every wish it must bound;
With the husbandman toils, and with monarchs is crowned;
Without it the soldier and seaman may roam,
But woe to the wretch who expels it from home!
In the whispers of conscience its voice will be found,
Nor e‚Äôer in the whirlwind of passion be drowned;
‚ÄôTwill soften the heart; but though deaf be the ear,
It will make him acutely and instantly hear.
Set in shade, let it rest like a delicate Ô¨Çower;
Ah! Breathe on it softly, it dies in an hour.
In chapter 9 of Emma Jane Austen introduces an elaborate
charade that plays a part in the plot. Mr Elton is invited to submit
62
secret language
a charade for the amusement of Emma and her prot√©g√©, Harriet.
He delivers the following:
My Ô¨Årst displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.
Another view of man, my second brings,
Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!
But ah! united, what reverse we have!
Man‚Äôs boasted power and freedom, all are Ô¨Çown;
Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,
And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
Thy ready wit the word will soon supply;
May its approval beam in that soft eye!
Emma interprets the Ô¨Årst two lines as referring to court, and the
next two to ship. These are united in the Ô¨Åfth line to form courtship
and the last lines carry on the courtship, which Emma mistakenly
believes to be aimed at Harriet, though in fact she herself is the
object of Mr Elton‚Äôs affection.
The charade with purely verbal clues lives on in collections of
word games for children, but in the nineteenth century another form
of charade came into vogue, probably Ô¨Årst in France, and that is what
most people today think of when charade is mentioned. This is a
game in which someone seeks to represent a word or phrase in mime.
The actor usually starts by indicating the category of phrase to be
represented. She might pretend to open a book to indicate a book
title, pretend to sing to indicate a song title, or wiggle the upraised
index and middle Ô¨Ångers of each hand to represent quotation marks
and thereby indicate a well-known phrase or quote.
The next step is to signal the number of words by holding up
Ô¨Ångers and then to hold up one Ô¨Ånger to indicate the Ô¨Årst word to
63
talking in riddles
be represented, then two Ô¨Ångers to indicate the second word, and so
on. More interestingly the miming can operate on the basis of
syllables. The number of syllables is indicated by laying the
appropriate number of Ô¨Ångers of one hand on the other arm, and
the Ô¨Årst syllable is then indicated by laying one Ô¨Ånger on the arm,
the second syllable by laying two Ô¨Ångers on the arm, and so on.
The breaking up of a word into syllables allows the rebus principle
to be employed. There is also a convention for indicating words or
syllables that sound the same as the target. A hand cupped behind
the ear is the conventional gesture for indicating ‚ÄòSounds like‚Äô.
There are also ways of representing the two most common
forms of inÔ¨Çection in English. Plural is indicated by linking the
little Ô¨Ångers, and past tense is indicated by waving your hand over
your shoulder as if you are brushing away a Ô¨Çy. In all there are forty
or so conventions for indicating characteristics of the word or
phrase to be guessed.
Equivocation and Prevarication
The idea that supernatural beings can communicate with humans
is widespread. Supposed communication can come through such
things as viewing the Ô¨Çight of birds or the entrails of a slaughtered
animal. In modern times there are still people who claim to be able
to tell the future from the distribution of tea leaves in the bottom
of a cup or the fall of dice. The thread connecting these possibili-
ties is chance. Where an outcome is not determined, there is scope
for seeing the inÔ¨Çuence of supernatural forces in the result. Dreams
and drug-induced hallucinations have long been a favoured source
of prophecy since they involve the brain producing a scenario
64
secret language
without any conscious determination on the part of the dreamer or
hallucinator. In the case of dreams, supernatural forces have often
been perceived as being at work.
In most societies communication from the spirit world is
believed to reach only a select few, variously called oracles, sooth-
sayers, shamans, priests/priestesses, witches/warlocks, or witch
doctors. In the Ancient Greek world there were sibyls who issued
prophecies. The term sibyl was ambiguous in that it could refer to
the ofÔ¨Åce of sibyl, the particular person holding the ofÔ¨Åce, or the
succession of sibyls who held the ofÔ¨Åce over the centuries. The
sibyls were women who inhabited caves or shrines, and their
succession may have gone back to pre-Hellenic times. The best-
known sibyl was the Delphic Sibyl, who lived on the side of
Mount Parnassus; other well-known sibyls included the Ery-
thraean Sibyl of Ionia in the Aegean and the Cumaean Sibyl,
who lived in caves near Vesuvius. They were said to have uttered
their prophecies in a state of induced frenzy, making strange,
inarticulate sounds, a kind of glossolalia. However, Cicero points
out (De Divitatione, LIV) that the prophecies of the Erythraean
Sibyl were written out so that the initial letters of the sections
formed words, i.e. they were acrostics, which indicates artful
presentation even if preceded by spontaneous enlightenment.
The sibyls were also said to have written their prophecies on sheets
which they placed outside their caves. This meant the prophecies
could be scattered by the wind, which might have added a degree
of obscurity, a desirable result from the point of view of the sibyl,
who needed to be vague, since obviously an explicit prophecy runs
the risk of being disproved and thereby ruining the reputation of
the prophet.
65
talking in riddles
A good example of the vagueness and ambiguity of typical
prophecy can be found in the story of Croesus, king of Lydia,
who consulted the Delphic Oracle in 550 bc about his chances of
success if he attacked the Persian empire. The Delphic Oracle, like
the Delphic Sibyl, lived on Mount Parnassus. Croesus was told he
would destroy a great empire. He also asked whether his kingdom
would be long-lasting. The Oracle replied:
Wait till a time shall come when a mule is monarch of Media;
Then, thou delicate Lydian, away to the pebbles of Hermus.
Croesus thought the idea of a mule (ƒìmionos) becoming king of the
Medes so fantastic that the prophecy must mean his kingdom
would last indeÔ¨Ånitely. He went ahead and attacked the Persians
and was defeated. He had destroyed a great empire, his own.
When he remonstrated with the Oracle, he was told that he should
have enquired which empire was meant, and the Oracle also said
that he had misunderstood about the mule. Cyrus was a mule
because his mother was a Mede and his father a Persian (Herodu-
tus 1: 53‚Äì5, 91). A mule is a hybrid of horse and donkey, so the
Oracle had used mule in a metaphorical sense.
A curious fact about the sibyls is that they were accepted as a
genuine source of revelation by early Christians, who were other-
wise intent on stamping out any traces of pagan belief. Augus-
tine, for instance, in The City of God (18: 23), quotes Lactantius,
who in turn quotes an unnamed sibyl as having prophesied
Christ‚Äôs suffering, death, and resurrection. The most famous
case of a pagan prophet being accepted as a source of Christian
revelation is that of Virgil‚Äôs fourth eclogue, part of which reads as
follows (lines 4‚Äì14):
66
secret language
Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;
magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo.
iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna,
iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.
tu modo nascenti puero, quo ferrea primum
desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mundo,
casta fave Lucina; tuus iam regnat Apollo.
Teque adeo decus hoc aevi, te consule, inibit,
Pollio, et incipient magni procedere menses;
te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,
inrita perpetua solvent formidine terras.
Now is come the last age of the Cumaean [Sybil‚Äôs] song: the
great cycle of the ages is born anew. Now returns the virgin,
returns the reign of Saturn: now from high heaven a new
generation descends. You, chaste Lucina, with the birth of this
boy, in whom the iron race now ceases, and the golden one
arises over all the world, grant your favour; Now your Apollo
reigns. And in your consulate, in yours, Pollio, shall this glory of
the age begin, and the great months begin to roll. Under your
rule any traces of our crime [will] vanish and free the world from
perpetual fear.
This was written about 40 bc, between the assassination of
Julius Caesar (44 bc) and Octavian‚Äôs victory over Antony at
Actium (31 bc). It is uncertain who the Wunderkind is (the
typical problem of the vagueness of prophecy) and discussion
has raged for two thousand years. The possibility of its refer-
ring to Jesus Christ is raised regularly. It is unlikely that Virgil
would have had any knowledge of or interest in Jewish Mes-
sianic prophecy. Those who have taken the lines as referring
to Christ assume that Virgil was granted a revelation. This
explains his respected status in the Middle Ages. Virgil‚Äôs
Aeneid was used for bibliomancy (see page 160), and Dante
67
talking in riddles
has Virgil as his guide to Hell and Purgatory in The Divine
Comedy.8
Sibyls Ô¨Ågure in Christian art and there is a reference in the Dies
Irae, which was part of the text of requiem masses until it was
eliminated by the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì5).
Dies ira, dies illa
solvet saeclum in favilla
teste David cum Sibylla.9
Day of wrath is that day
When ends the world in Ô¨Åre‚Äôs decay
As David and the Sibyl say.
As mentioned above, oracles and fortune tellers tend to be
equivocal or vague, and with good reason, since precise predictions
can easily prove wrong. Sometimes they speak in riddles and, if the
few examples that have been preserved are any indication, they
regularly use metaphors, as in the mule example.
8
Those who take Virgil‚Äôs poem to be a messianic prophecy are
encouraged by parallels with Isaiah. Virgil predicts that in the Golden
Age to come there will be an abundance of nature and an absence of
sudden death: ‚ÄòNo great lions will the herds have to fear . . . the snake shall
die and the deceiving poisonous plant‚Äô. Isaiah had predicted a similar
abundance (7: 21‚Äì25) and a similar period when, to use Tennyson‚Äôs
phrase, nature would no longer ‚Äòbe red in tooth and claw‚Äô. ‚ÄòThe wolf
also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
and the calf, and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child
shall lead them‚Äô (11:6).
9
The phrase dies ira, dies irae Ô¨Årst appears in the Vulgate translation of
Sophonias/Zephaniah 1: 15. It was incorporated in a number of medieval
poems. The ‚ÄòÔ¨Ånal version‚Äô quoted here, at least the version that was used in
requiem masses, is attributed to Thomas of Celano.

There is a well-known example of equivocation in Macbeth.
Macbeth seeks to know what the future holds for him and consults
three witches, who summon up apparitions. An apparition of a
bloody child gives Macbeth the following assurance (IV.1):
Be bloody, bold and resolute; laugh to scorn
The power of man, for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.
Then another apparition gives a further assurance:
Macbeth shall never vanquish‚Äôd be, until
Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.
Macbeth takes the Ô¨Årst prediction to mean that no man can harm
him since all men are born of women, and since he knows that
woods cannot walk, he takes the second prophecy to mean he can
never be defeated. However, when Macduff‚Äôs forces attack Mac-
beth they cut down branches from Birnam Wood and carry them
to Dunsinane as camouÔ¨Çage, so in a sense Birnam Wood does
come to Dunsinane. And Macduff can be regarded as not having
been born of woman because he was ‚Äòfrom his mother‚Äôs womb
untimely ripp‚Äôd‚Äô‚Äîin other words, delivered by Caesarian section.
Here is the exchange in which Macbeth learns how the prophecy
deceived him (V.8).
macbeth Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
To one of woman born.
69
talking in riddles
macduff Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother‚Äôs womb

In a modern rewriting of Macbeth by Peter Moffat in the
ShakespeaRe-Told UK television series (2005) the witches are
replaced by rubbish collectors who assure Macbeth that he is safe
by telling him pigs will Ô¨Çy before he is defeated. This quotes the
saying ‚ÄòPigs might Ô¨Çy‚Äô and sounds like a watertight guarantee. But
when Macduff comes to confront Macbeth, a police helicopter is
heard overhead. Pigs might Ô¨Çy indeed!

CIPHERS AND CODES
It may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can
construct an enigma which human ingenuity may
not by proper application resolve.
EDGAR ALLAN POE, ‚ÄòTHE GOLDEN BUG‚Äô
O
ver the centuries people have often felt the need to
record information secretly. Those involved with occult
lore or with science often recorded their knowledge in
secret writing. Plutarch mentions that the priests of Delphi had
records of old oracles preserved in secret script (Lysander 26: 2), and
in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance it was common to encrypt
critical details of new discoveries, including new recipes. People
regularly Ô¨Ånd the need to communicate secretly. Governments
need to be able to keep their communications secret from other
governments, especially in time of war. In both war and peace
commercial enterprises need to keep new inventions, new models,
new marketing strategies, and the like secret from competitors, and
planned cost-cutting measures secret from trade unions. Criminals
and those involved in plots obviously need to be able to communicate
72
in secret, as do clandestine lovers. In the famous Indian erotic
classic, the Kama Sutra, which was probably put together in the
second century ad, women are advised to gain a knowledge of
ciphers for communicating with lovers. In the nineteenth century
lovers often placed encrypted messages in the personal columns of
newspapers, although these were not very secure and there was a
risk of pranksters cracking the cipher and sending false replies.
Young people often use codes and ciphers, partly to conceal
communication from parents or teachers and partly just for fun.
It is interesting to note that nowadays there are websites that allow
you to encrypt and decrypt messages. For anyone interested, and
not seriously worried about security, this is a boon. It saves a lot of
tedious encryption and decryption letter by letter. But the same
computer technology that enables people to perform low-level
encryption also enables governments and commercial enterprises,
both legitimate and criminal, to achieve a level of sophisticated
encryption undreamt of a generation ago. Whenever we use our
computer to do our banking or pay our bills, we are entrusting the
security of our account to such a system.
Secret communication can be in any medium: sign, speech, or
writing. Disguised speech in forms such as Pig Latin and back
slang is described in Chapter 8. This chapter deals with writing,
which allows much more elaborate forms of encryption than
speech.1
Modern writing includes the typewriter, the teleprinter,
and more signiÔ¨Åcantly the computer.
1
The forms of disguising written language are generally very different
from those found with speech. Kahn (1966: 75) mentions a form of
73
ciphers and codes
There are basically two ways of concealing the content of a
written message. The Ô¨Årst method is to hide one message inside
another. This is known as steganography. The other method is to
encrypt a message. This can be done either using a cipher or a code
(or a mixture of the two). A cipher involves transposing the letters
of plain text as in an anagram or replacing them by substitute
letters from the same alphabet, another alphabet, or a set of non-
alphabetic symbols. A code involves employing substitutes for
words or phrases. Morse code is a misnomer since this system is
in fact a form of cipher. Each letter is allotted a pattern of long and
short sounds: a  ‚Äî, b ‚Äî   , e , i , etc.2
One form of secret writing is private shorthand. Systems like
this have a long history; one was used by Cicero (the Roman
writer, not the World War II spy!). In many forms of shorthand
the distinction between cipher and code is blurred since symbols
are substituted for letters, for common sequences of letters such as
(in English) -ing, and for common words such as the. In the
Hunan province of China women developed a secret form of
writing known as Nu-shu ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs writing‚Äô. It was a syllabic script
using derivatives of Chinese characters and some other compo-
nents such as dots and arcs. It circulated only among women and
substitution used in India that existed in spoken and written form. From
the information he gives it seems it was basically a spoken form that could
be written in the same way that we might write Pig Latin.

A reader has pointed out that phrases or sentences such as ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs
snowing down south‚Äô to indicate that a woman‚Äôs petticoat is showing
are examples of code. In cases like this there is no exact non-coded
expression. ‚ÄòYour petticoat/slip is showing‚Äô would be the closest equivalent
in this case.
74
secret language
was used for communication and for literature. It was not only
written but also embroidered in fabric and incorporated in painted
artwork. It fell into disuse after the Chinese Communist Revolu-
tion made literacy available to women.
Steganography and encryption are probably as old as writing.
Plutarch records that when the Spartans wanted to recall the
general, Lysander, they wrote the order on a strip of parchment
and wound it around a staff. They wrote the message in lines along
the length of the staff, then unwound the strip of parchment and
gave it to a messenger. When Lysander received the strip, he
wound it around his baton and was able to read the message.
The staff used was called a scytale. Anyone intercepting the
messenger would Ô¨Ånd a strip of parchment in which there were
columns of jumbled letters (Plutarch, Lysander 19:4‚Äì7).3
This was a
primitive form of transposition. Figure 9 illustrates the general
idea. Note that unless the text covers all the available space, the
strip will contain sequences of letters (pivo, llef, etc. in Figure 9)
separated by spaces, which would make it easy to align the
sequences. It would help to use gibberish to Ô¨Åll up all the available

See also Thucydides 1:131, which mentions a scytale message sent to
recall the general, Pausanias, who was suspected of colluding with the
Persians.

space and thus produce a continuous sequence of letters on the
strip.
In the Middle Ages it was generally believed that knowledge of
subjects such as astrology, alchemy, theology, and magic should be
restricted. Roger Bacon suggested using enigmatic phrases, secret
words and alphabets, abbreviations, and a mixture of languages.
Simple ciphers were sometimes used, as in the following example,
where each vowel is replaced with the following consonant (Kieckhefer
1989: 141). Note that the whole text is not enciphered, just the
critical words.
So that you may see what others cannot see, mix the bile de cbttp

The Roman alphabet used here did not distinguish i and j or u and
v, k was not used, and w did not exist, so that the next consonant
after u was x and the next consonant after i was l.4
The use of secret alphabets or idiosyncratic symbols, which
was one of Bacon‚Äôs suggestions, was popular in the Middle Ages,
since it was an easy option when texts were hand written. The
fourteenth-century poet Chaucer enciphered a few sections of his
Treatise on the Astrolabe with some special symbols. Around this
4
A later writer who could be said to have followed Roger Bacon‚Äôs advice
by using secret alphabets and a mixture of languages was Samuel Pepys
(1633‚Äì1703), who used both methods in his diary. He wrote in a form of
shorthand devised by Thomas Shelton and he used French and Spanish
vocabulary in describing his amorous adventures: I . . . had her main, which
elle did give me, . . . and did hazer whatever I voudrais avec l‚Äô, which did plaisir
me grandement (‚ÄòI had her hand, which she did give me, . . . and did do
whatever I wanted with it, which did pleasure me greatly‚Äô).
76
secret language
time a strong interest in all forms of secret writing was spreading
through Europe. This interest ran hand in hand with a curiosity
about magic, and from time to time ciphers and codes that seemed
impenetrable were held to be the work of the devil.
By the time of the Renaissance nations and city-states in Europe,
including the Vatican, regularly encrypted diplomatic correspond-
ence, and by the seventeenth century it was common for nations to
have code-breaking bureaus known as black chambers. From that
time the success or failure of secret communication was to play an
important part in history. For example, in 1587 Mary, Queen of
Scots, was executed by Queen Elizabeth I of England for treason.
Mary was condemned on the basis of evidence obtained from
enciphered messages circulating between her and her supporters.
These ciphers were cracked by Thomas Phelippes, in the employ
of Elizabeth‚Äôs principal secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham.
One problem with successfully decrypting an enemy message is
that if you act on the information obtained, your action is likely to
indicate to the enemy that you are decrypting their messages,
which will drive them to adopt a more secure system and cut off
your potential source of information. A famous example of this
occurred in World War I. Early in 1917 the British intercepted and
decrypted a telegram from Arthur Zimmermann, the German
foreign minister, to the German ambassador in Mexico. Anxious
to prevent the entry of US troops into the war on the Western
Front, Zimmermann suggested to the Mexican government that
they attack the United States and try to regain territory lost in
1848. The British passed the contents of this telegram to the
United States so as to inÔ¨Çame public opinion against Germany,
but they had to cover the fact that they had broken a German
77
ciphers and codes
code, so they arranged for a spy to steal a copy of the decoded
message from the German embassy in Mexico.
In some instances it is necessary to ignore what has been learnt
from breaking an enemy cipher or code even if it means letting
people die. During World War II the British broke a new cipher
used by the Germans, which revealed among other things that
Germany was going to shoot down a commercial airliner Ô¨Çying
from Lisbon to London in the belief that Winston Churchill
would be on board. In fact well-known actor Leslie Howard was
on the Ô¨Çight, along with his accountant, Alfred Chenalls, who
happened to look like Churchill. The British hoped to gain a
signiÔ¨Åcant strategic advantage from Germany‚Äôs continued use of
the cipher in question, and therefore did not wish to reveal that
they had broken it. As a consequence they took no steps to delay or
protect the Ô¨Çight, instead allowing events to take their course. The
plane was shot down (Wolfe 1970: 11‚Äì15).
Steganography
The practice of hiding a secret message inside another message is
known as steganography. One way, which is of no linguistic
interest, is to render the secret message invisible. Many a child
has dabbled with invisible ink, often lemon juice, which can be
made visible by applying heat, and anyone familiar with spy stories
will know about microdots, which are photographs of documents
reduced to the size of a full stop and placed in a non-secret
document.
Most secret communication involves some form of encryption
using either a cipher or a code, but one of the problems with this is
78
secret language
that if you are captured with an encrypted text in your possession,
you are likely to be put under duress to reveal the underlying
message. But if the presence of a message is concealed, the bearer
can remain free of suspicion. Herodotus relates the story of a
Greek living in the Persian empire who got word of Xerxes‚Äô
plans to invade Greece. To warn the Spartans he took two
waxed tablets, removed the wax, wrote his message, and then
covered the message with a new coating of wax. A messenger was
able to take the tablets to Sparta without discovery by the guards
keeping watch over the roads. According to Herodotus the Spar-
tans did not know what to do with the tablets until Gorgo, the
widow of Leonidas (the hero of Thermopylae), suggested remov-
ing the wax. One wonders why the messenger did not advise this.
Perhaps he had not been told, in case he was tortured by the
Persian guards (Herodotus, Book vii, chapter 239).
In Chapter 2 the acrostic was introduced as a literary device
rather than a means of serious deception, but, as indicated there,
an elaborate acrostic can provide some measure of secure commu-
nication. During the civil war in seventeenth-century Britain a
certain royalist, Sir John Trevanion, was incarcerated in Colchester
Castle. One day his gaoler handed him the following message from
a friend (Smith 1955: 25‚Äì6):
Hope, that is ye beste comfort, cannot much, I fear me, help
you now. That I would saye to you, is this only: if ever I may be
able to requite that I do owe you, stand not on asking me. ‚ÄôTis
not much that I can do, but what I can do, bee ye verie sure I
wille. I knowe that, if dethe comes, if ordinary men fear it, it
frights not you, accounting it for a high honour, to have such a

bie submission you can turn them away, ‚Äôtis the part of a wise
man. Tell me, an if you can, to do for you anythinge that
you wolde have done. The general goes back on Wednesday.
restinge your servant to command.
On the face of it it seems an innocuous message, the sort of thing a
friend might write to someone in jail and in danger of execution.
But if one takes the third letter after each punctuation mark, then a
hidden text is revealed. These letters have been underlined and
they spell out the following message:
panel at east end of chapel slides
In 1499 Johannes Trithemius (1462‚Äì1516) compiled a work
entitled Steganographia, which circulated in manuscript form for
over a century until it was published in 1606. The reason for the
delay in publication was that it was placed on the Index of
Prohibited Books by the Vatican on the grounds that it was an
occult work. Trithemius illustrates a simple form of steganography
in which one reads every second letter of the text, ignoring the Ô¨Årst
and last words. An example is given below, from the introduction
to a message.
pamersiel anoyr madrisel ebrasothean abrulges itrasbiel nadres
ormenu itules rablon hamorphiel
Ignoring the Ô¨Årst word, which indicates which system is being
used, and starting with the second letter of the next word, one
reads Nym die ersten Bugstaben de omni uerbo, a mixture of German
and Latin that translates into ‚ÄòTake the Ô¨Årst letter of every word‚Äô
(the letters are underlined in the example above). The words in
which the message is hidden are voces mysticae, traditional magic
80
secret language
words, or at least they look like such (Shumaker 1982: 100). The
Ô¨Årst word, pamersiel, is the name of the chief spirit of the east, and
still Ô¨Ågures in occult lore today. Much of Trithemius‚Äô work is
couched in the language of the occult and the passage quoted here
looks like a conjuration of spirits so it is no surprise that the
Steganographia was banned on the grounds that it dealt in com-
munication with devils.
This system is straightforward from the decrypter‚Äôs point of
view, but it would take some ingenuity to compose a sensible
text in which every second letter was prescribed. Trithemius also
described another system in which one extracts the hidden message
by taking the initial of the fourth word from the end of the text and
then going backwards through the text taking the initial of every
fourth word; then repeating the process starting with the third last
word, then with the second last word, and Ô¨Ånally with the last
word. Again this is easy for someone to read if they have the key,
but it is extraordinarily difÔ¨Åcult to compose a reasonable text
with the initials of all the words prescribed in advance (Shumaker
1982: 103‚Äì4). The method is not really practical where there are
time constraints. Trithemus gives an example in Latin, a language
allowing considerable freedom of word order, which makes the task
somewhat easier than it would be in most languages.
Steganography occasionally turns up in crime and espionage
Ô¨Åction in the form of a short message inserted somewhere in a
larger text. A rather general phrase such as ‚Äòin the Ô¨Ånal analysis‚Äô is
used to alert the intended recipient to where the message begins.
The recipient then reads the initials of the following words.
A modern form of steganography is employed in recordings. It
has become common since the 1960s for words to be recorded
81
ciphers and codes
backwards on tracks of popular songs, mostly rock. The technique
is known as backmasking. The words, phrases, or sentences can
only be heard by playing the track in reverse. Christian fundamen-
talists in the United States have claimed that satanic messages are
being passed subliminally into the minds of listeners. It is true that
some bands, possibly provoked by the Christian fundamentalists,
have inserted some ungodly messages in reverse, including a
reverse version of the Lord‚Äôs Prayer, but there is no evidence that
anyone can pick up the secret message, even subliminally, from a
normal playing of the track.
Substitution Ciphers
For the purposes of keeping whole texts secret, the most widely
used system is a cipher (also cypher), which involves replacing each
letter by a different letter or symbol. In the jargon the plain text
(the original) is said to be enciphered. The process of recovering
the plain text is decipherment. If the cipher is secure, the message
can be deciphered only by the intended recipient armed with the
key. If it is not secure, someone who intercepts the message may be
able to ‚Äòcrack‚Äô or ‚Äòbreak‚Äô the cipher. With codes as opposed to
ciphers there are analogous terms, encode and decode. The terms
encrypt and decrypt are broader and apply to ciphers and codes.
One of the earliest known ciphers is the one used by Julius
Caesar for conÔ¨Ådential passages in his private letters to friends. The
method was quite simple: for each letter of the plain text he
substituted the letter three places on in the alphabet, so that a
became d, b became e, and so on (Suetonius: De Vita Caesarum,
Divus Julius 56 ). Here is the full set of substitutions. Note that
82
secret language
there are 23 letters in the Roman alphabet, there being no j, u, or
w. Letter i had the values [i] and [y] according to its position in a
word, and v had the phonetic values [u] and [w] (later [v]). The
letter k is included here, but it was used only in transliterating
Greek words. Here and in subsequent illustrations I follow the
convention of using lower case for plain text and small capitals for
encrypted text.
a b c d e f g h i k l m n o p q r s t v x y z
d e f g h i k l m m o p q r s t v x x z a b c
Here is an example from one of Caesar‚Äôs letters to Cicero in which
he says, ‚ÄòLet this be the new way of conquering that we fortify our
position by mercy and generosity‚Äô.
haec nova sit ratio vincendi vt misericordia et liberalitate nos
mvniamvs.
ldhf qrzd xmx zmqhqgm zx pmxhvmfrvgmd hx omehv-
domxdxh qrx pzqmdpzx
There are twenty-three possible Caesar ciphers using the Latin
alphabet, twenty-six using our Roman alphabet. None of them
is particularly secure since by trial and error an interceptor is
likely to discover the principle. One might seek to scramble the
cipher alphabet, but such a cipher is still vulnerable to analysis
on the basis of letter frequencies. Although the Caesar cipher is
the simplest and least secure of ciphers, it is still in use today in
some internet forums, where only superÔ¨Åcial security is re-
quired.
One method of producing a cipher alphabet somewhat less
systematically related to the plain text alphabet is to use a code
word, a practice that has been in use since the seventeenth century.
83
ciphers and codes
A code word or phrase, in this instance March Ô¨Årst, is written
below the plain text alphabet starting under a and omitting any
repeated letters. The remaining letters are then Ô¨Ålled in in
sequence as follows:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
m a r c h f i s t b d e g j k l n o p q u v w x y z
Of course the letters of the cipher alphabet could easily be more
thoroughly scrambled, but if a number of messages need to be sent
over a period of time, the cipher needs to be changed, preferably
daily, and there has to be a way of informing the intended recipients
what the cipher alphabet for a particular day is to be. The use of a set
of code words circulated in advance is one way of doing this.
Here is a short military message enciphered with the alphabet
shown above.

battalion reported moving south.

kuohc amqqmetkj ohlkoqhc gkvtji pkuqs
In this example the word breaks of the plain text have been
maintained, which would provide an aid to anyone trying to
decrypt the message without the key. In practice messages are
normally transmitted in blocks of Ô¨Åve characters. This provides
greater security, but it is also done for practical reasons. Random
characters are hard to handle in blocks of more than Ô¨Åve. One
tends to lose one‚Äôs place in typing long sequences. Here is the same
message in Ô¨Åve-letter blocks with a null (letter c) added to com-
plete the last block.

All substitution ciphers that encipher each letter of the plain text
by the same cipher letter (monoalphabetic ciphers) are vulnerable
to breaking on the basis of frequency analysis. Figure 10 gives
approximate relative frequencies for the letters of English over a
variety of types of text.
In order to decipher a substitution cipher without the key one

85
ciphers and codes
seeks to match them with the plain text alphabet on the basis of
frequency. For long messages in normal English, this method
would produce quick results. In practice the frequencies in a
particular genre may be different from those based on a large
body of different types of text. For instance, military messages
with frequent references to hq would mean the low-frequency
letter q would have a greater than normal frequency. A bigger
problem is small sample size. If there are only one or two short
messages, it is unlikely the frequencies in these messages will give a
clear guide to the plain text. Here are the frequencies for the
message given above:
a 2 h 10 o 7 v 1
b i 2 p 4 w
c 5 j 6 q 6 x
d k 7 r 1 y 1
e 1 l 2 s 2
f 1 m 6 t 4
g 4 n 1 u 2
This suggests that h in the cipher alphabet is e in the plain
alphabet, which happens to be correct. The letters m, c, j, k, o,
and q are likely to correspond to t, a, i, o, n, s, r, or h, but a lot of
trial and error is required to determine the precise correspond-
ences. The key reveals that the last letters of the alphabet are
enciphered as themselves. These are low-frequency letters and
this shows up in the frequency count.
A cryptanalyst also looks for common digraphs (th, er, on, an) and
common trigraphs (the, and, tha, ent, ion, tio, for, nde, has), as well
86
secret language
as for common words such as and, the, of, in, to, and that. It is
interesting to note that que is the most common trigraph in Spanish
and is also very common in French, while che is the most common
trigraph in Italian. These are the equivalents of that in English, so
their high frequency is predictable. The frequency of que is further
increased by the fact that it is the Spanish word for what.
Chronogram
In a number of ancient languages including Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin letters of the alphabet served as numerals. In the Middle Ages
Jews took to indicating the date of death in epitaphs and the date of
publication in books by choosing Hebrew phrases such that the date
could be read from the initials. This practice then spread to other
Europeans, who used letters for their Roman numeral value: I ‚Äòone‚Äô,
V ‚ÄòÔ¨Åve‚Äô, X ‚Äòten‚Äô, L ‚ÄòÔ¨Åfty‚Äô, C ‚Äòhundred‚Äô, D ‚ÄòÔ¨Åve hundred‚Äô, and M
‚Äòthousand‚Äô. For instance, an epitaph for Queen Elizabeth I has the
form My Day Closed Is In Immortality in which the capital letters
MDCIII give the date of her death, 1603.
The Arabic scholar al-Kindi (801‚Äì873 ad) wrote on almost every
Ô¨Åeld of knowledge including cryptanalysis, and he is credited with
being the Ô¨Årst to point out that transposition and substitution
ciphers can be broken on the basis of frequency analysis.5
A later
Muslim scholar, al-Qalqashandi, published an encyclopaedia in
the fourteenth century that included a section on cryptology.6
5
Al-Kindi also introduced Indian numerals to the Muslim world,
those same numerals that found their way to Christian Europe where
they are known as Arabic numerals.
6
Qalqashandi acknowledges a debt to al-Mausili. In fact the debt is to
generations of Muslim scholars who developed an interest in cryptology
from working on religious texts such as the Qur‚Äôan.
87
ciphers and codes
He included information on the frequency of letters and sequences
of letters, and he pointed out that one could use multiple substi-
tutions for high-frequency letters to defeat cryptanalysis on the
basis of letter frequency.
These ideas made their way to Europe and by the beginning of
the Ô¨Åfteenth century it was standard practice to include ‚Äòhomo-
phones‚Äô as they were called, i.e. cipher equivalents for particular
plain text letters, mainly high-frequency letters. Obviously more
than twenty-six letters were needed, so pairs of digits were used.
Another method of frustrating frequency-based analysis was to
encipher pairs or trios of letters. Again digits were used. The
Argenti family, who were in charge of the Vatican ciphers in
the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, were probably
the Ô¨Årst to disguise some common sequences, for instance, by
eliminating qu, by writing double consonants as single ones, and
by other deliberate misspellings. They also used lots of nulls
(dummies or Ô¨Ållers), which disturbed the natural distribution of
letters (Kahn 1966: 113).
A more secure form of substitution cipher is a polyalphabetic
one in which plain text letters are enciphered by more than one
alphabet. Polyalphabetic ciphers came into use in Italy in the
Ô¨Åfteenth century. A widely used polyalphabetic substitution was
one devised by Johannes Trithemius in the early sixteenth century
and popularized later in the century by the French diplomat Blaise
de Vigen√®re (1523‚Äì1596). Twenty-six different alphabets were used,
each one offset by one place from the preceding one so they
formed a ‚ÄòVigen√®re square‚Äô as shown in Figure 11.
The procedure for enciphering the plain text is as follows. Find
the Ô¨Årst letter of the plain text in the leftmost column and read
88
secret language
across the row until you Ô¨Ånd the column headed by the Ô¨Årst letter
of the key. In the example below the plain text is ‚Äòremain in
position‚Äô so the Ô¨Årst letter is r. The key is PINCER and the r-row
intersects with the P-column at a cell Ô¨Ålled by g, so g is the Ô¨Årst
letter of the cipher text. The second letter of the plain text is e and
the second letter of the key is I; the e-row meets the I-column at m,
so m is the second letter of the cipher text. Here is an illustration of
the full encipherment. The keyword is shorter than the text, so it is
repeated as many times as is necessary. An alternative would be to

Repeating the keyword is a weakness. Consider the following
message, which is to be enciphered by the Vigen√®re square using
the keyword PINCER. If a sequence of plain text occurs more
than once and if the start of that sequence happens to correspond
to the same letter in the keyword, there will be a repeated sequence
in the cipher text. This is illustrated below, where the word the is to
be enciphered with the keyword sequence PIN at the beginning of
the text and again eighteen letters later. This happens again
twenty-four letters later, where the word they happens to begin
where the keyword begins.

Interceptors would note these intervals and also the intervals
between the two-letter repeats in the cipher text resulting from ss
and nd being enciphered by the same key sequence (all these are
shaded). They would note that the intervals were all multiples of
90
secret language
six; they would conclude that six different alphabets had been
used, and they would make six different frequency distributions.
One would be for the Ô¨Årst letter, the seventh, the thirteenth, etc.
The second would be for the second letter, the eighth, the four-
teenth, etc., and so on. If there was enough material to throw up
reasonable frequency distributions, then informed guesses could
be made about likely plain text equivalents, and with some trial
and error it is likely the plain text could be recovered.
A longer keyword gives greater security, but is still vulnerable to
frequency analysis. However, the Vigen√®re square was used as a
Ô¨Åeld cipher as late as the nineteenth century by the Confederate
army in the American civil war and by other armies in other
campaigns. Field ciphers need not be fully secure. They carry
tactical information and need to be secure only for as long as it
takes to do such things as move troops.
If a longer keyword provides greater security than a short one,
the logical extension of this principle is to have a keyword that is as
long as the message. One way of accomplishing this is to use
another text. In Graham Greene‚Äôs Our Man in Havana the prot-
agonist is given a copy of Lamb‚Äôs Tales from Shakespeare. To
encrypt or decrypt a message all he needs to know is the agreed
starting point for a particular day. He then proceeds to add the key
text to the plain text by taking a to be equal to 1, b to 2, c to 3, and
so on. Adding b (2) and d (4) yields f (6). The system is cyclic so
that adding x (24) and d (4) yields b (2), i.e. 28 minus 26. Although
this is an improvement on the method described in the previous
paragraph, it is still vulnerable. Someone intercepting a message in
the Lamb‚Äôs Tales system could try subtracting common sequences
of letters such as the, -ing, -ious, or -ment at various points of the
91
ciphers and codes
message. If they were persistent enough, or better if they had a
computer, they would Ô¨Ånd little bits of plain text, and they might
eventually be able to piece together some or all of the plain text or
the key text. The ultimate solution is a random key that is used
once only. This is discussed below.7
Steganography can be combined with a cipher. Johannes
Trithemius (1462‚Äì1516), mentioned earlier as the compiler of
Steganographia, gives examples of a text in which one takes the initial
of every second word and then applies a Caesar shift. For instance,
the text Tuis respondere litteris gauderem, ita Xhristus me gaudere
faciat; transmitteremque . . . (‚ÄòI would be glad to reply to your letter,
as Christ makes me glad, I would send . . . ‚Äô) yields rgxgt, but if we
substitute the letters two places back in the alphabet for each of
these letters respectively, we get Peter (Shumaker 1982: 105).
In 1508 Trithemius published a second work on cryptography
called Polygraphia. This contained an ingenious combination of
cipher and steganography. The system was imitated by Giovanni
7
Vigen√®re also developed the notion of taking the plain text itself as
the key. This is a form of auto-key. It usually works like this. A keyword is
used to supply an offset. In the example below the keyword HEAT is
aligned with the Ô¨Årst four letters of the plain text and is followed by the
plain text. The intended recipient receives the cipher ojuvhhe etc. and
subtracts the keyword HEAT to recover the Ô¨Årst four letters of the plain
text (getb). These four letters are then subtracted from the next four letters
of the cipher text (hhev) to reveal the next four letters of the plain text
(ackt), which are then subtracted from the next four letters of the cipher
text, and so on.

Baptista della Porta in De Furtivis Literarum Notis ‚ÄòConcerning
Secret Letter Signs‚Äô, published in 1563, and it is from this work that
the above illustration is drawn via Shumaker (1982: 110‚Äì11).8
A large number of alphabets is provided and against each letter is
a Latin word. A simpliÔ¨Åed version appears in Figure 12. Six
alphabets are given and only the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åve letters of each. The
process of encipherment involves using the alphabets in succes-
sion. For instance, to encipher the phrase bad ace, one uses the Ô¨Årst
alphabet to encipher b, which yields Accepi, the second alphabet to
encipher a, which yields litteram, the third alphabet to encipher d,
which yields sincere, and so on, until we have Accepi literam, sincere
et excellentissime Federice ‚ÄòI have received [your] letter, sincere and
most excellent Frederick‚Äô. The ingenuity lies in the fact that the
words in each alphabet are mutually substitutable so that as we
move across the alphabets we produce acceptable sense. All the
words in column one are verbs in the Ô¨Årst person, perfect aspect,
compatible with the words in the second column, which are

Della Porta had a number of suggestions for improving the security of
ciphers and codes. One was the use of synonyms for common words and
names and the other was varying the spelling.
93
ciphers and codes
variations on the theme letter/epistle. The words in columns three
and Ô¨Åve are all Ô¨Çattering adjectives in the vocative case linked by
co-ordinating conjunctions in column four and relating to a
personal name in the vocative case in column Ô¨Åve. The numerous
alphabets are all designed so that encipherment produces accept-
able text and disguises the presence of a hidden message.
In Book VI of The Advancement of Learning Francis Bacon gives
an interesting example of a combination of cipher and stegano-
graphy. The cipher component consists of a binary representation
of the alphabet using only the letters a and b, predating by more
than three hundred years the use of binary representation in
computers. Five bits are used to cater for the twenty-four letters
of the Elizabethan alphabet‚Äîa practice which also predates the
modern use of blocks of Ô¨Åve in sending code or any strings of
letters that do not make sense.
Bacon gives an example of the biliteral alphabet with the Latin
word Fuge! ‚ÄòFlee!‚Äô
aabab baabb aabba aabaa
As a cipher this is a straightforward substitution, but it is hidden
inside a message using two alphabets, the a-alphabet and the
b-alphabet. There are slight differences in the form of the letters
between the two alphabets, an extra serif here, an extra loop there.
One takes a text, which will be sent openly, and in writing it one
chooses letters from the a-alphabet or the b-alphabet so as to
reproduce the sequence of a‚Äôs and b‚Äôs in the biliteral rendering of
fuge. Bacon‚Äôs example is Manere te volo, donec venero ‚ÄòI want you to
wait until I come‚Äô. In order to represent aabab, etc., one takes the
m and a of manere from the a-alphabet, the n from the b-alphabet,
94
secret language
the e from the a-alphabet, and the r from the b-alphabet, and so
on. This is illustrated below:
m a n e r e t e v o l o d o n e c v e n e r o
a a b a b b a a b b a a b b a a a b a a
Anyone who intercepts the message sees Manere te volo, donec
venero, but the intended recipient who is armed with the two
slightly different alphabets goes through letter by letter writing
down a sequence of a‚Äôs and b‚Äôs, and then marks off blocks of Ô¨Åve
and reads the hidden message from the key to the biliteral repre-
sentation as in Figure 13.
There are mechanical aids to encipherment. Alberti, a genius of the
Italian Renaissance, invented a simple device consisting of alphabets
arranged around the edges of concentric discs. The plain text
alphabet was on the larger outer disc, and the cipher text on the
smaller disc. One could lock the position of the smaller disc relative
to the larger one and encipher by reading from the outer alphabet to
the inner. There were twenty-four different possible offsets and by
revolving the inner disk after a speciÔ¨Åed number of letters one could
produce polyalphabetic substitution. Alberti was perhaps the Ô¨Årst to
introduce polyalphabetic substitution. The outer disc also contained
the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 for sending coded numeral groups.
American president Thomas Jefferson invented a cipher device
consisting of wheels mounted on an axle, with an alphabet on the

circumference of each wheel. It was ‚Äòreinvented‚Äô by Etienne Bazi√®res
in the late nineteenth century and became widely used. Modern
versions of such a device were employed in World War II. These had
twenty-Ô¨Åve wheels each bearing a randomized alphabet, plus a blank
wheel carrying a pointer. A device of this type is illustrated in Figure
15. The wheels can be assembled on the shaft in any order and this
order is the key. Normally there would be a number or phrase to
determine the key for a particular day. When the wheels are
assembled on the shaft, they are rotated so that the Ô¨Årst twenty
letters of plain text are aligned along the guide rule. Any other row
can supply the cipher text. Yes, that‚Äôs right: any other row. The
intended recipient is in possession of the key so he (or she) has the

wheels in the same sequence. On receiving the Ô¨Årst twenty letters of
cipher text the recipient aligns it along the guide rule and scans the
other rows, one of which should contain the plain text. After the Ô¨Årst
twenty letters have been transmitted, the sender loosens the wheels
and twiddles them so that the next twenty letters of plain text are
aligned above the ruler.
Transposition
The other method of encipherment is to transpose the letters of
the plain text. In Figure 16 the message has been written vertically
in Ô¨Åve columns from left to right. Two null letters have been added
at the end to Ô¨Åll the matrix.
Now if the rows of this matrix are sent in Ô¨Åve-letter blocks, the
recipient or an interceptor will see the following:
mngps eihet entta tebet mtyru eotpe anhat tienn
The intended recipient will have information on how the scram-
bling was arranged. An interceptor will have to decide Ô¨Årst whether
15. Jefferson-type cipher device.
97
ciphers and codes
this is a transposition cipher or a substitution cipher. Since letters e
and t, and to a lesser extent a and n, stand out in frequency, an
interceptor will conclude that it is most likely a transposition
cipher. He or she will then have to use trial and error to Ô¨Ånd the
path by which the letters were scrambled. In this instance the
degree of security is very low since the interceptor is likely to realize
that reading the Ô¨Årst letters of each block gives plain text, then
reading the second letter of each block, and so on. Choosing any
number of columns other than the Ô¨Åve used in transmitting the
message would have obscured this.
Transposition and substitution can be combined. Late in World
War I the Germans used the ADFGX cipher, which combined the
two principles. It involves a 5  5 matrix with the letters ADFGX
indexing the rows and columns. The alphabet is distributed ran-
domly over this matrix. Since there are twenty-six letters in the
alphabet the Germans combined i and j, as had been done in
various derivatives of Roman script. This is illustrated in Figure 17.

Letters of plain text are enciphered using the coordinates of the
matrix. Suppose we have a message ‚Äòsend report asap‚Äô, the Ô¨Årst
letter s will be enciphered as xd, the second letter e as gg, and so
on. The result of this encipherment can be written out across a
number of columns and the columns transposed according to
some key. This is illustrated Figure 18, where the message has
been written out across six columns.
Now if these columns are rearranged so that, for instance,
columns 1 and 2 are separated, it means that the digraphs encipher-
ing the letters of plain text are dismembered. For example, the
digraph xd enciphering s will be split up. This was a very secure
system and the Allies had limited success in breaking it.

Codes
In 1384 Gabriele di Lavinde, who was secretary to the Avignon
anti-pope Clement VII, published a book called Liber Zifrarum
‚ÄòBook of Ciphers‚Äô, in which he suggested using short groups of
letters to stand for proper names of common occurrence within an
enciphered message. This was probably to save time and effort, but
it represents the Ô¨Årst instance in Europe of code. As we have
already seen, a code essentially operates at the word level whereas
a cipher works at the level of individual letters. A mixed cipher-
code of the type proposed by Lavinde is called a nomenclator. The
box on p. 96 shows that Alberti‚Äôs cipher disc included the
numerals 1, 2, 3, and 4 to allow words to be encoded by a sequence
of digits.
Lavinde and Alberti had in mind the use of code words within
an enciphered text, but it has been common practice for centuries
to insert code words in plain text. Military personnel are not
allowed to reveal their whereabouts in time of war and their mail
is censored. During World War II my father deposited a list of
code words for likely locations in the PaciÔ¨Åc with my mother. If he
wrote that she should plant petunias in spring, this indicated he
was in New Guinea. If he suggested poppies it meant he was in
Borneo, and so on. This is essentially a kind of steganography.
A word can stand for another word or phrase or one phrase can
stand for another. For instance, I might send the sentence I hope to
get more supplies tomorrow and the recipient might interpret this as
Enemy build up along northern coast because he or she has been
given a list of sentences and equivalents. This is a useful method
100
secret language
for communicating with spies or resistance Ô¨Åghters in enemy terri-
tory. Certain phrases or sentences can be incorporated in a news-
paper article, a speech, or a radio broadcast. To the uninitiated the
code phrases and sentences will be taken literally, but to those who
have been supplied with a list of code phrases and sentences and
their equivalents, they will convey a different message.
To send a message completely in code requires equivalents for a
large number of words. Since, as we have seen above, messages are
normally transmitted in Ô¨Åve-letter blocks, it is convenient to use
code words of Ô¨Åve constituents. The individual components can be
letters, Ô¨Ågures, or other symbols such as % or &, so a code word is
not a word in the normal sense. A code book is like a bilingual
dictionary and should consist of a list of plain text words in
alphabetic order with their code equivalents and a list of code
words in alphabetic order with their plain text equivalents, as
illustrated in Figure 19.
The main problem with codes is the security of the code books.
These are substantial and need to be distributed widely, for
instance, to all the embassies of a nation or to all naval vessels in
a Ô¨Çeet. There is always a danger that an enemy will manage to get
access to one. Because of the difÔ¨Åculty of producing and distrib-
uting code books, a code is generally used over a long period, and a

ciphers and codes
large body of text encoded in the same system if intercepted by the
enemy can lend itself to breaking on the basis of frequency
analysis. In normal English the most common words are a, of, to,
in, it, is, be, as, to, so, the, and, for, are, but, not, you, that, with,
have, and this, but these frequencies may not hold for the tele-
graphic style often adopted in messages. Other words are likely to
be frequent in certain genres, as is illustrated by the military terms
in Figure 19. Providing alternatives for common words makes a
code safer. Another aid to security is to scatter meaningless Ô¨Åve-
character blocks as nulls through the text.
Towards a Random Key
During the period between World War I and World War II a
number of enciphering machines were developed, the best known
of which is Enigma. It was patented by a German, Arthur Scher-
bius, in 1918 and it came into general use by the German govern-
ment and armed forces in 1926. It was the size of an old desk
typewriter, but it was housed in a box and was portable. The
method for enciphering was to type the plain text letter by letter
on a keyboard and receive in return a cipher equivalent shown by
the illumination of a letter on a lampboard. The sequence of
illuminated letters could be copied down and transmitted.
The heart of the machine consisted of three alphabetic wheels
(upgraded to Ô¨Åve in World War II) mounted on a shaft. When a
key on the keyboard was depressed a current ran to the corre-
sponding contact on the Ô¨Årst wheel, then to a contact on the
second wheel, then to a contact on the third wheel, and then to
a contact on a reÔ¨Çector, which sent the current back via a different
102
secret language
path through the wheels to the lampboard. As each letter was
enciphered the Ô¨Årst wheel moved on one place; after twenty-six
letters a lug on the wheel moved the wheel to the right on one
place. After this wheel had gone through a revolution, it moved the
wheel to its right on one place. This provided 26  26  26
(17,576) substitutions. The three wheels could be removed from
the shaft and put back in any other order, there being six possi-
bilities (3  2  1).
In addition to this mechanism there was a plugboard on the
front of the machine on which were two alphabets with a hole for
each letter. (In the interest of legibility, only one is shown in the
schematic diagram in Figure 20.) The operator was supplied with
six short cables that could be used to connect six pairs of letters.
On one day a in one alphabet might be linked to x and c to s. On
another day b might be linked to s and d to p. The combination of
the plugboard, the wheels, and the fact that the wheels could be
mounted on the shaft in different orders meant that the machine
could produce a more or less random key of enormous length.
The Enigma machine is pictured in Figure 20 along with a
schematic diagram. The arrows show the passage of electric current
from a key on the keyboard through the plugboard and the scram-
blers (the three wheels) to a reÔ¨Çector and back again to a lamp on the
lampboard. The system is reciprocal. If typing in plain text x yields
cipher text y, then cipher text y will yield plain text x. The same
machine can be used for encryption and decryption. To communi-
cate using Enigma the sender and receiver must have their machines
set up in the same way. They must have the same settings for the
plugboard, the order in which the wheels are mounted on the shaft,
and the initial settings of the wheels in the scrambler.

Enigma provides a very high level of security, but not as high as
the Germans believed.9
On the eve of World War II an Enigma
machine was smuggled into Britain, and the British had consider-
able success in reading German cipher messages by exploiting the
fact that the content of messages such as weather reports is largely

By 1931 the Poles were able to build a replica of an Enigma machine
from documents provided by a German traitor, and from time to time
they were also given the book of settings for each day. The Germans used
these printed instructions to set their machines for the day, but then they
sent a key for each particular message, i.e. they began by sending a three-
letter sequence that was to be used for the particular message. This was an
added precaution, but they sent it twice in case it became garbled in

predictable and provides a crib. This was illustrated in the Ô¨Ålm
Enigma (2001), based on the book by Robert Harris.
One-Time Pad
Around the end of World War I somebody came up with the idea
of a one-time pad. Machines such as Enigma aim to produce a
sequence of letters that is near to random and that does not repeat.
A sequence of letters that was truly random and never reused
would, in theory, provide an unbreakable cipher, and this was
the notion behind a one-time pad. Chunks of a sequence are
distributed to users on pads of paper. If there are only two users,
each of them receives a pad. A, the sender, takes a sheet from the
pad and adds the sequence of letters to produce the cipher text. B,
the recipient, uses his copy of the same sheet to subtract the key
and obtain the plain text. The pages from the pad can be used in
order or chosen according to some predetermined sequence.
transmission, so, for instance, if the message key was gxd they enciphered
gxdgxd before proceeding to use this setting for the message proper.
A Polish cryptographer, Marian Rejewski, was able to exploit the fact
that the Ô¨Årst and fourth letters enciphered the same plain text letter,
similarly the second and Ô¨Åfth and the third and sixth. He noted the
intervals between plain and cipher letters and using his own replica he
went through every setting and noted the intervals that arose in encipher-
ing the same letter twice. Over the course of a year he compiled a list of
correspondences between settings and intervals, and was able to deduce
the settings of the scrambler from the intervals. This enabled him to read
partial messages and to deduce the substitutions made via the plugboard.
For instance, if he read kiroglam, he might see that this is kilogram with l
and r transposed (Singh 1999: 149‚Äì55).
106
secret language
Users are required to destroy the used pages immediately after
encipherment and decipherment. If a page from a one-time pad is
reused, a cryptanalyst who comes into possession of two or more
messages enciphered with the same page has some chance of
deciphering the text. We begin by assuming the plain text under-
lying the messages contains certain common sequences of letters
such as the, and, tha, ent, ion, tio, for, nde, and has. Suppose we
look for the. We assume the begins right at the beginning of the
message, then in the second position, the third position, and so on
right through the message. At each position we subtract the and
obtain a sequence of letters that will be a part of the one-time pad
at any point where the occurs. We then subtract each of these
sequences from the second message and if that yields a likely bit of
plain text, we have probably identiÔ¨Åed the in the Ô¨Årst message.
This is illustrated below. The Ô¨Årst message is ‚ÄòSend the supplies
asap‚Äô. In attempting to break the cipher we go through the cipher
text assuming the occurs somewhere. When we actually get to the,
the cipher text is vxv. Subtracting the from the cipher text yields
bpq. When we subtract bpq from the corresponding point in the
cipher text of the second message, we obtain ‚Äòand‚Äô, a likely piece of
genuine plain text. If we are lucky, we will be able to Ô¨Ånd a few
cases where we can identify a likely sequence in the second message
and hopefully we can expand the sequences, which in turn means
we will be able to work out the corresponding stretch of one-time
pad and subtract this from the Ô¨Årst message to obtain plain text. In
theory we can keep expanding fragments in each message and
eventually decipher both messages. In practice this would not be
easy with just short messages, but in these days of computers a
large number of possibilities can be tried very rapidly.

Although a one-time pad is theoretically unbreakable, there are
two problems. One is how to generate a truly random sequence.
A method used at one time by the USSR was to compose random
sequences on a typewriter, but it is not hard to see that the
compositor is likely to favour certain sequences of keystrokes.
Some have used the lottery system in which twenty-six letters
marked on chips are placed in a bowl. The bowl is shaken and a
chip is drawn out blindly and recorded. It is then returned to the
bowl and the process is repeated as often as needed. Nowadays
random sequences are generated by computer, but true random-
ness is not so easy to achieve and some programs that purport to be
truly random are not. The other problem is to ensure the actual
pads remain secret; they are an obvious target for enemy spies.
Recently the paper pad has been replaced by some form of elec-
tronic storage. A computer housed in a mobile phone can store the
one-time pad and be used for encipherment and decipherment,
but it is not safe from spies, and there is a problem with erasing the
data.
Secret Communication in the Computer Age
Most of us make unwitting use of sophisticated ciphers, for
instance when we perform banking transactions over the internet.
108
secret language
Computers operate in terms of binary digits (bits), and letters
or numbers are represented by seven-digit binary numbers.
The upper case A, for instance, is represented by 1000001 in
the standard method of representation, namely the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). Computers
can carry out substitutions not only for these binary numbers,
but even for the bits that compose them; moreover, they can
transpose the bits in a number and bits in adjacent binary
numbers.
Here is an example of carrying out substitution on a plain text
message ‚Äòcat‚Äô with a key dog.
1. Plain text: cat
2. Plain text in ASCII: 100001110000011010100
3. Key: DOG 100010010011111000111
4. Cipher text: 000011100011100000011
5. Key: DOG 100010010011111000111
6. Plain text in ASCII: 100001110000011000100 (same as line 2)
Adding or subtracting bits operates in the following way. If the
two bits are the same, we write 0; if they are different, we write
1. In the example above the ASCII code for C is 1000011 and the
ASCII code for D is 1000100. In the Ô¨Årst position we ‚Äòadd‚Äô 1 and
1 and obtain 0 as our cipher value in line 4. In the second, third,
and fourth positions we add 0 and 0 and write 0 in line 4. In the
Ô¨Åfth, sixth, and seventh positions we are adding 1 and 0, so we
write 1 in each case, and so on. This might seem an odd
operation that loses information, but note that performing the
same operation on the cipher text (line 4) and using the same
key (line 5) reveal the original plain text (line 6).
109
ciphers and codes
All information in a computer is represented in this way‚Äînot
just letters, numerals, and other symbols but sounds and images,
including moving images. At this point cryptography has little to
do with language. Readers interested in following developments in
cryptography in the computer age are advised to read the Ô¨Ånal
chapters of books such as those by Simon Singh listed in the
bibliography, and then google the technical terms for more recent
information.
Voice transmission can also be encrypted. Between the world
wars there were scrambling devices that separated the speech signal
into Ô¨Åve frequency bands and swapped the bands around, so that
the output of the lowest frequency band, for instance, was trans-
mitted as a higher frequency band. In another variation the speech
signal was broken into short segments ands these segments were
rearranged. This was analogous to a simple local transposition,
rather like sending a word like stamp as tmasp, except that in
speech the individual phonemes are not clearly separate as in
writing, so a particular segment might contain part of one phon-
eme and part of another. Neither method was very secure and in
World War II the Americans used a system called Sigsaly in which
the speech signal was sampled every twenty milliseconds and its
amplitude modiÔ¨Åed. Nowadays with digital representation of
speech the binary numbers and the bits that compose them can
be subject to transposition and substitution, as mentioned above.
Final Word
Although machines like Enigma provide a high level of security,
they are too slow for use on the battleÔ¨Åeld, where speed is the
110
secret language
more important consideration. For this reason simple, traditional
ciphers have been used in combat zones until quite recently. But
there is a way of combining speed and security that does not
involve any encryption and that is to use a language unknown to
the enemy. The Americans used native speakers of American
Indian languages to pass messages in both world wars: Choctaw
speakers in World War I and over four hundred Navaho (Navajo)
speakers in World War II, as well as small numbers of speakers of
Choctaw, Comanche, and other languages. The speakers
invented native terms for military concepts. The Comanches,
for instance, called a tank a ‚Äòturtle‚Äô and a bomber a ‚Äòpregnant
airplane‚Äô.10
The use of steganography, ciphers, and codes has largely been
motivated by the practical necessity of concealing information
from rivals, competitors, and enemies, but the process of devising
a secure means of communication and the business of trying to
break a code or cipher provides a stimulating mental challenge for
the general public. Cryptographic puzzles and problems are a
popular form of entertainment, and cryptology plays a part in
literature. Substitution ciphers have featured in works such as
Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Golden Bug‚Äô, Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äôs The
Adventure of the Dancing Men, and several of Dorothy Sayers‚Äô
detective novels. In the Ô¨Ålm 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) the
10
Having learnt about the use of Choctaw speakers in World War I
Hitler sent anthropological linguists to the USA in the 1930s to learn
American languages. Knowing this, the US made little use of American
languages in the European theatre of war (Wikipedia entry for Code

BIBLICAL SECRETS

DEUTERONOMY 18:10
Kabbalah
Among Jewish scholars in Provence and northern Spain in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries there developed a school of
mystical speculation that came to be known as the Kabbalah
(also Cabala, Kabalah, qabalah). The word ‚ÄòKabbalah‚Äô means
‚Äòreceiving‚Äô and it was claimed that the school was carrying on an
oral tradition incorporating divine revelation to Adam and Moses.
The principal notions of Kabbalah concern a model of the uni-
verse showing the relationship between God, spirits, and humans,
and are not related to language, but within this philosophy there
were notions about language, particularly Hebrew. These notions
became inÔ¨Çuential in Christian Europe in the Renaissance and
114
still attract some interest today. Sacred texts tend to receive close
scrutiny and the Hebrew Bible, particularly the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åve books
(Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)
known collectively as the Torah, were examined by Kabbalists
for anagrams, ciphers, and acrostics. In Hebrew letters of the
alphabet served as numerals and scholars placed values on the
numerical properties of words in the Bible. These values are
shown in Figure 23.
Before examples are given it should be pointed out that the
Hebrew alphabet used in the Bible consists entirely of consonants.
Originally no vowels were written, as we see in the earliest inscrip-
tions, from the tenth century bc. But at some time between the
tenth and sixth centuries the letter j (y) came to be used for a Ô¨Ånal √Æ
and f (w) for Ô¨Ånal √ª. In the period after the Babylonian exile of the
sixth century the use of these letters was extended to indicate vowels
within the word so that j could indicate √Æ or √™, and f could indicate √ª
or √¥ (Lambdin 1973: xxiii). Much later, around the seventh century
ad, a system of ‚Äòpointing‚Äô was introduced by the Masoretes ‚Äòthe

Some of the letters have alternative forms that are used at the end of a word. These are used for
the numbers 500 to 900 as follows: x k 500, z m 600, w n 700, √û p 800, y

bearers of tradition‚Äô. This involves subscript dots for vowels. It
should also be noted that Hebrew is written right to left.
Anagrams
A linguistic feature of biblical texts that stimulated some interest
was the anagram. Since biblical Hebrew was written without
vowels, it is relatively easy to Ô¨Ånd anagrams. One example is
between the name Moshe (Moses) and Ha-Shem, ‚ÄòThe Name‚Äô.
The consonants in Moses/Moshe are m sh
h (eum) and in Ha-Shem
h sh
m (zue). Ha-Shem was, and still is, one of the ways of
referring to God without using the sacred name yhwh ‚ÄòYahweh‚Äô
(efej). A notion similar to the anagram was that permutations of
the letters in a word still held the essence of the word, so that all
twelve cambinations of the four consonants in yhwh held the
essence of the sacred name (Reuchlin 1993: 307). In Umberto Eco‚Äôs
novel, Foucault‚Äôs Pendulum, one of the characters, Jacobo Belbo,
has a computer program for listing all combinations of four letters
which is used to identify all the permutations of yhwh (not that
such a task really requires a computer). SigniÔ¨Åcantly, the computer
is called AbulaÔ¨Åa after the thirteenth-century Kabbalist Abraham
AbulaÔ¨Åa, who placed great signiÔ¨Åcance on the letters of Hebrew
and the text of the Hebrew Bible.
Ciphers
Examples of cipher have been identiÔ¨Åed in the Bible, although the
enciphered text consists of particular words rather than long
116
secret language
passages. In one scheme, Atbash, the Ô¨Årst letter of the alphabet is
substituted for the last letter, the second for the next to last, the
third for the third from last, and so forth. In Jeremiah there is a
reference to a king of Sheshach in a list of kings (25:26) and there is
a further reference in a prophecy about the fall of Babylon: How is
Sheshach taken! . . . What a horrifying sight Babylon has become!
(51:41). Sheshach has been taken to be an Atbash variant of
Babel, i.e., Babylon, which the reader can check from Figure 23:
Sh ! b, Sh ! b, and Ch (or k) ! l. This identiÔ¨Åcation of
Sheshach as Babylon has been widely accepted and some transla-
tions of the Bible simply convert Sheshach to Babylon.
Other systems of encipherment identiÔ¨Åed in the Bible include
Abgad, in which each letter in the Hebrew alphabet is replaced by
the one succeeding it, so that aleph is replaced by beth, beth by
gimel, and so on.1
This system has been used in amulets. In
another system, Albam, the Ô¨Årst letter of the alphabet is replaced
by the twelth, the second by the thirteenth, and so on, a corres-
pondence that can be read vertically in Figure 23. People have
claimed to have found various hidden words (usually names) in the
Bible using one substitution system or another. However, it seems
likely that some of the ‚ÄòÔ¨Ånds‚Äô are the result of coincidence, given
that in a purely consonantal system there will be many consonant
sequences that correspond to more than one word or phrase, as
with Moshe and Ha-Shem.
1
The reader can see how the names Atbash, Albam, and Abgad are
formed by looking at Figure 23. Aleph is to read as ‚Äòa‚Äô. Each name is based
on the Ô¨Årst two substitutions in the system. It will be seen that Atbash
involves t for a and sh for b; Albam involves l for a and m for b, and Abgad
involves b for a and d for g.

biblical secrets
Notarikon
Followers of the Kabbalah Ô¨Ånd acrostics in the Bible, speciÔ¨Åcally in
the Torah, a practice known as notarikon. It involves taking
phrases or sentences from the Torah and seeing if the initials,
medials, or Ô¨Ånals form a word or phrase. It is essentially acrostics,
but typically with acrostics the hidden names are clearly deliberate
and their distribution is systematic. For instance, in an acrostic
poem all the initials of the lines or all the initials of the stanzas will
form a word, as illustrated in Chapter 2. With notarikon, however,
the investigator searches through the text like someone trying to
break a cipher and Ô¨Ånds that here and there a sequence of initials
or Ô¨Ånals forms a word. From the sentence MY IOLH LNW
HSH
MIMH ‚ÄòWho shall go up for us to heaven?‚Äô (Deuteronomy
30: 12) the initials form the word MILH ‚Äòcircumcision‚Äô and the
Ô¨Ånal letters form YHWH ‚ÄòYahweh‚Äô (taking y√¥dh and waw with
their consonant value), from which it has been argued that cir-
cumcision has divine approval (Westcott 1910). The chances of an
accidental acrostic vary from language to language but are high in
biblical Hebrew and in English. The text of this book contains
hundreds of examples of three-letter and four-letter words formed
by sequences of initials, plus a few examples of longer words.
In another variation of notarikon each letter of a word is taken
to stand for another word. For instance, mizbeah
. ‚Äòaltar‚Äô has been
‚Äòexplained‚Äô as meh
. ilah zekhut berakhah h
. ayyim ‚Äòforgiveness, merit,
blessing, life‚Äô (Werbolowsky and Wigoder 1997).2

The leader of the Jewish revolt against Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the
second century bc was Judah Macabee. Some believe the epithet Macabee
118
secret language
Some people claim that if one takes the line of succession from
Adam to Abraham, i.e., Adam, Seth, Enosh, etc., the initial letters
of the names form a sentence meaning, ‚ÄòI will forgive (or lift up)
my enemies, having compassion, forgiving those made from (or
laid low in) dust a second time‚Äô. 3
Given that for the most part
vowels were not written in biblical Hebrew the string of conson-
ants derived from the initials of the names allows more than one
possibility of interpretation, more so when one considers that it
can be broken up into words in more than one way.
The persistence of belief in hidden acrostics in the Bible is
interesting and is epitomized in a recent popular book, The Bible
Code by Michael Drosnin (1997). Drosnin claims, ‚ÄòThe Bible is
constructed like a giant crossword puzzle. It is encoded from
beginning to end with words that connect to tell a hidden story‚Äô
(1997: 25). His method of Ô¨Ånding hidden messages is to search for
words, especially proper names, phrases, and dates, by looking for
sequences of letters spaced at equal intervals throughout the text.
In the simplest instance one starts at the Ô¨Årst letter of the Bible and
looks for words made up of successive letters, then one looks for
words made up of every second letter, every third letter, and so on.
There is no limit to these intervals beyond what is determined by
is an acronym of Mi kamocha ba‚Äôelim YHVH, ‚ÄòWho is like unto thee among
the mighty, O Lord!‚Äô (Exodus 15:11), which was used on the standards of his
army. Reuchlin (1993: 313) notes that the Gematria total for MKBY is 72,
which equals the total of YHVH, but this is only true if subtotals for Y (10),
YH (15), YHV (21), and YHVH (26) are added together.

the length of the text. The name Yitzhak Rabin, that of the Israeli
prime minister who was assassinated in 1995, was found with an
interval of 4,772. The search can begin with the second letter of the
Bible, the third, the fourth, and so on. All this means there is a
good chance of Ô¨Ånding words and phrases, and Drosnin appears to
admit as much. However, he claims that when these words are
found, there are often related words found nearby that constitute
prophecies. Near to the name Yitzhak Rabin he Ô¨Ånds ‚Äòassassinate‚Äô
and ‚ÄòAmir‚Äô, the name of the assassin. The concept of ‚Äònearness‚Äô is
crucial. When a word, say a name, is found, the text is written out
in lines that equal the distance between its constituent letters. In
the case of Rabin, the lines of text will be arranged in sixty-four
rows of 4,772 letters. This means that the name Yitzhak Rabin will
appear at some point as a vertical sequence and one then surveys
the area surrounding this vertical sequence.
Rather than reproduce Drosnin‚Äôs Hebrew example, in Figure 24
I have shown part of an English text with Obama showing up as a
vertical sequence. In looking at this Ô¨Ågure one needs to think of

a very large text where the letters o-b-a-m-a occur at intervals of,
say, 1,208 and the text is written out in rows of 1,208 letters to show
o-b-a-m-a as a vertical sequence. Note Ô¨Årst that the sequence win
(shaded) occurs next to the Ô¨Årst a in Obama. Of course this
contiguity exists however the text is arranged, but win becomes
signiÔ¨Åcant only when the preceding a is recognized as part of the
sequence Obama. Now look at the top line of the matrix, where
the word win can be picked out at intervals of seven. This piece of
text is not near Obama in the original text, but comes to be near
only when the text is written out with a line length matching the
intervals between the letters o-b-a-m-a.
If a text like this had been examined in this way prior to the
2008 American presidential election, it could have been taken as a
prophecy of Obama‚Äôs success, even without the example of win
that is contiguous with Obama. Drosnin Ô¨Ånds a number of sig-
niÔ¨Åcant contiguities, such as the pair Clinton and president, and the
four terms Hitler, evil man, Nazi, and slaughter. He describes the
odds against such juxtapositions arising by chance as astronomical.
My impression is that these juxtapositions are not so unlikely,
particularly if we take a generous view of what is near (see the
second win example) and allow that more than one word can be
semantically appropriate to a particular name, e.g. succeed or win;
kill, cut down, or assassinate.
Drosnin has challenged his critics to Ô¨Ånd comparable
revelations in other texts, such as Moby Dick. One person
who has taken up the challenge is Brendan McKay of the
Australian National University, who demonstrates that Drosnin‚Äôs
method reveals a prediction of Drosnin‚Äôs own assassination in
Melville‚Äôs novel. When Drosnin‚Äôs name is written vertically
121
biblical secrets
using Drosnin‚Äôs method, it is intersected by ‚Äòhim to have been
killed‚Äô.4
Gematria
In most ancient languages, including Akkadian, Hebrew, and Greek,
the letters of the alphabet served as numerals. This meant that any
sequence of letters designating a word could have a numerical inter-
pretation, and conversely some sequences of numbers could coincide
with a word. This is marginally possible with Roman numerals in
English; an example given in Chapter 1 is the sequence CLIX, which
can be 159 or a trade name for a brand of crackers. This ambivalence
led to a form of numerology where the numerical properties ofwords,
such as the sum of the numerical values of their letters, was held to be
signiÔ¨Åcant. Jewish scholars of the Kabbalah claimed to have found
hidden meanings in the Torah by such methods.
The Greeks called the study of the numerical properties of
words isopsepha, but it is better known as gematria (also gima-
triyyah), a word associated with Jewish traditions but ultimately
from Greek geometria ‚Äògeometry‚Äô (Birnbaum 1964; Werbolowsky
and Wigoder 1997).5
One of the earliest examples of gematria
concerns Sargon II of Assyria. When he built Dur-Sharrukin,

Gematria scores the occasional mention in Ô¨Åction. In the 1998 Ô¨Ålm Pi

universe (including the stock market!), meets someone who believes in
gematria and gives up his search to help his new acquaintance Ô¨Ånd

present-day Khorsabad, he decreed that the length of the walls was
to be 16,280 Assyrian units, a Ô¨Ågure which equalled the numerical
sum of the letters in his name. Leonides of Alexandra wrote
couplets in which the numerical total of the two lines matched,
or quatrains where the totals for the couplets matched (Cameron
1995: 478). Among the grafÔ¨Åti found in the ruins of Pompei there
is one in Greek that reads ‚ÄòAmerimnus thought about his lady
Harmonia for good. The number of her honourable name is 45‚Äô.
Another reads Phil≈ç hƒìs arithmos  ‚ÄòI love her whose number is
545‚Äô. These numbers probably seem unromantic to us, but in a
world where formal properties of words were of interest and
numerology was popular, they probably had some considerable
signiÔ¨Åcance. The number 45 incidentally is not the value of
Harmonia. As can be seen from Figure 25, the number 45 is 
(me) in Greek and must have some reference unknown to us.
Discoveries have been made in and around Egypt of amulets
containing stones engraved with the name of a spirit or god, Abraxas
(earlier Abrasax). The name also appears frequently in curse tablets,
often in conjunction with other names of spirits or gods. Abraxas is
associated with the Basilideans, followers of Basilides, a religious
teacher in early second-century Alexandria. Basilidean teaching
combined ideas from a number of religious traditions including

Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Christianity. If one adds the numerical
value of the Greek letters of Abraxas or Abrasax (`√¶√Ü√Ü or
`√¶√Ü√Ü), one obtains the total 365 (1 √æ 2 √æ 100 √æ 1 √æ 200
√æ 1 √æ 60), which corresponds to the 365 orders of spirits recognized
in the Basilidean model of the universe (Budge 1978: 208). It also
corresponds to the number of days in the solar year, and Abraxas was
associated with the sun (Ogden 1999: 48).
Disciples of the Kabbalah developed a strong interest in the
numerical properties of proper names, and they claimed that the
numerical sum of the letters in words indicated hidden revela-
tions in the text of the Bible, at least in the Torah. Interest in the
numerology of the Bible and in the Kabbalah generally spread to
Christian scholars of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
The numerical value of a word can be obtained by adding up
the value of each letter, so that efej yhwh has the value of 26 (y
(10)√æh(5)√æw(6)√æh(5)). As an example of seeing signiÔ¨Åcance in
the numerical value of a name consider the fact that in Genesis 14:
14 Abraham‚Äôs servants are said to number 318 and a few verses later
Eliezer is introduced as Abraham‚Äôs steward (Birnbaum 1964: 123;
Roth 1966). Eliezer (tgpjla) scores 318, a Ô¨Ågure that readers can
calculate for themselves from Figure 23. This does not seem to
matter much, and if it is not coincidence, it may mean that the
writer was indulging in some in-group communication as an
exercise in ingenuity.
For a more signiÔ¨Åcant example consider the interpretation given
to part of Genesis 49:10:
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
beneath his feet, until Shiloh shall come; and unto him shall the
gathering of the people be.
124
secret language
The words ‚ÄòShiloh shall come‚Äô are ShILH IBA (with A for aleph)
and the numerical value is 300√æ10√æ30√æ5 for ShILH and 10√æ2√æ1
for IBA, making a total of 358. The word Messiah is MShIH and has
the same total (40√æ300√æ10√æ8). This leads to an interpretation
that the Messiah shall come.
As mentioned above, interest in the Kabbalah was not conÔ¨Åned
to Jews, and gematria became popular among writers on magic and
the occult in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. For
instance, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, who was
mentioned in Chapter 2, claimed that the shapes, order, and
numerical equivalents of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet did
not arise by accident but were ‚Äòformed divinely, so that they relate
to and accord with the heavenly bodies, the divine bodies, and
their virtues‚Äô. Hebrew names in the Bible, including those derived
from gematria, were set by God himself ‚Äòaccording to a number
and Ô¨Ågure which are unchangeable by reason of their eternal

A belief that there are hidden meanings in the text of the
Hebrew Bible is understandable given the traditional Jewish
belief that Hebrew is the original language given by God to
Adam and Eve. It was believed that the language had magic
properties, and that there was a connection between words of
Hebrew and their referents, a connection that was lost in the
arbitrary languages that sprang up after Babel (Zika 1976: 122;
Shumaker 1982: 33). This idea is taken up in Chapter 6. However,
it should be pointed out that the Hebrew script illustrated here
came into use after the Babylonian exile (sixth century bc),
superseding an earlier script. Both scripts derived from a Phoen-
ician script, which in turn was ultimately derived from Egyptian
125

hieroglyphs. We have already looked at innovations in the use of
the letters j (y) and f (w) to indicate vowels. Textual diversity
continued until the second century bc, around which time
the numerical values of the letters were assigned (S√°enz-Badillos
1993: 76).
Whatever one may think of this type of gematria, it is strange
that some people apply the practice to the Bible in translation. In
English one would take the values: a ¬º 1, b ¬º 2, and so on down
to z ¬º 26. God would score a value of 26 (7√æ15√æ4), which might
excite some devotees since this is the value of yhwh in Hebrew;
but since French dieu would score a different value, and similarly
with Italian dio, German Gott, etc., it is hard to see any rationale.
A gematria enthusiast would Ô¨Ånd signiÔ¨Åcance in the fact that Jesus
and Messiah both score the same, namely 74, but given the
number of words and phrases that can apply to Jesus, such as
Emmanuel, Christ, and Son of Man, there is scope for coincidence.
This applies more generally: there are numerous names in the
Bible, quite apart from other words, and there will inevitably
be instances where totals match or where one is twice another and
so on.
Onomancy
Since at least classical times there has been a belief that names can
be the basis of predicting someone‚Äôs future. Divination using
names is called onomancy. It overlaps with gematria in that the
numerical values of letters play a part. Onomancy was widely used
to predict the winner of a contest by considering the number
values of the letters in the names of the contestants, the number
126
secret language
values of the days of the week, and so on. As one commentator
notes, ‚ÄòThe practice of onomancy was rooted in the same presup-
positions noted in protective magic using magic squares and
numbers, that language has a mathematical correspondence to
reality‚Äô (Jolly 2002: 57).

YIDDISH PROVERB
Beliefs About Language
This chapter and the next are largely concerned with belief in the
supernatural and belief that there is an intimate connection
between the form of a word, especially a personal name, and
what the word refers to. The subject of this chapter is words that
are thought to have power to affect some aspect of the physical
world, and in the following chapter we move on to words that
are taboo.
128
In our society certain speech acts have power, as when a mar-
riage celebrant says, ‚ÄòI now pronounce you husband and wife‚Äô or a
judge says, ‚ÄòI hereby sentence you to three years‚Äô hard labour‚Äô.
Society agress to confer power on formulaic utterances like these
when they are used by properly authorized persons in speciÔ¨Åed
circumstances. However, for most humans who have ever lived,
and still for some millions living today, some words, phrases, and
texts are regarded as having an inherent power to change some
aspect of the environment, in particular to cure or curse, or to
provide protection against unwelcome change. Some of these
words and phrases have to be used in an appropriate ritual carried
out by a suitable person, but the words are not considered to be
arbitrary or the creations of ordinary humans like the words used
by a marriage celebrant or a judge.
A moment‚Äôs consideration will make it clear that there is no
natural relationship between the form of a word and what it stands
for. For a start there can be more than one word for the same
entity. In English the words rock and stone both have much the
same reference, as do girl and lass or Ô¨Ålm and movie. Moreover,
there are numerous languages and most of them have their own
words for any particular shared entity. What we call a dog in
English is chien in French, Hund in German, anjing in Indones-
ian, and inu in Japanese. However, the belief that there is a
connection between words and their referents is widespread.
Even among the sophisticated Greeks the question was an open
one. In Plato‚Äôs dialogue, Cratylos, Socrates serves as arbiter in a
debate in which one participant, Cratylos, argues for a natural
relationship between words and meanings, while the other par-
ticipant, Hermogenes, argues that the relationship is arbitrary or
129
words of power
conventional. Anyone arguing for a natural relationship between
words and referents points to onomatopoeic words, i.e., words
that are imitative of a sound or the source of a sound, such as gong,
twang, and cuckoo. There are also sets of words that exhibit sound
symbolism, an apparent connection between part of a syllable and
the sense. For instance, a number of words in English have the
rhyme -ump and refer to rounded protuberances (lump, rump,
mumps) or an impact with something rounded or heavy (bump,
crump, dump, thump).
The argument fails owing to the relative scarcity of such words,
but some people still believe in a natural relationship between
word and referent. They will tell you bum is a dirty word (and
children caught uttering such words have sometimes been forced
to wash their mouths out with soap1
) or that slug is an appropriate
word for the creature it denotes because both are unpleasant
(although a person who might say this probably wouldn‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd
any unpleasantness in words for slugs in unfamiliar languages).
Some words do become contaminated by usage. Nigger is a good
example. Originally an innocent enough word deriving from niger,
the Latin for ‚Äòblack‚Äô, it has acquired unpleasant connotations by a
long period of racist usage.
Most readers will be familiar with the notion of sticking pins in a
voodoo doll in an attempt to harm the person the doll represents.
This is part of a belief found in numerous cultures that one can
affect a person or animal by means of some kind of image. Frazer
(1911a: 52) calls this homeopathic or mimetic magic. A Ô¨Ågurine may
1

130
secret language
be made of clay, tallow, wax, wood, or dough, while an efÔ¨Ågy can be
made from reeds or grass. The link between the Ô¨Ågurine or doll and
the victim is made by taking corporeal matter or efÔ¨Çuvia from the
victim and attaching it to the image or by writing the victim‚Äôs name
on the image. Some form of ritual involving incantation is per-
formed, and the image is then injured, destroyed, or placed in some
inauspicious place such as a grave or a drain. An injury to part of the
image, say the head, right arm, or left leg, is supposed to cause the
victim pain in the corresponding part of the body.2
If the efÔ¨Ågy is
destroyed, that is supposed to bring about the victim‚Äôs death.
Although such images are usually used in an attempt to harm an
enemy, some have been made of a beloved and have been subjected
to love charms.
An alternative to making an image is to take a body part such as
hair or nail clippings, or else bodily efÔ¨Çuvia and to subject that to
some kind of ritual. This is an example of what Frazer calls
contagious magic, the belief that something once in contact with
or part of a creature remains part of that creature.3
In many cultures a name is like an efÔ¨Ågy or a body part in that
damaging the name, for instance by stabbing it or scrambling it, is
2
Frazer distinguishes mimetic or homeopathic magic in which one
produces an effect by imitating it, and contagious magic where an object
has power deriving from the creature it was formerly in contact with. Both
are subsumed under the widely used broader term sympathetic magic
(1911a: 52).

In Europe it was not uncommon to damage a footprint in an attempt
to damage the person who made it. It was also believed that some people
who were ill had had sorcery performed on their footprint and that their
footprint had been taken. There were even ritual procedures for restoring
the missing footprint (Clark 2002: 104‚Äì5).
131

thought to be capable of damaging or destroying the owner of the
name. In fact the term ‚Äòowner‚Äô is not always appropriate, since in
some cultures a name is not owned but is considered part of a
person (examples are given in Chapter 7). Philip Peek, writing
about African views of language, states, ‚ÄòDeeply felt concern about
names, their creation, use and avoidance, reÔ¨Çects this general
point, in that to name something is to know its essence and
possibly control it. Names do not simply describe; they are their
referent‚Äô (Peek 1981: 27).
Many, perhaps most, cultures have myths about the origin
of language. People tend to identify themselves as the original
humans and take their language to be the original human lan-
guage, and they often explain language diversity as the result of
some later divine punishment or a natural disaster that dispersed
the population. The Kaska people of western Canada, for instance,
have the following story (condensed from Teit 1917: 442‚Äì3):
Once there came a great Ô¨Çood, which covered the earth. The
people became separated. Some were driven far away. When
the Ô¨Çood subsided, people were now widely scattered over the
world. When, in their wanderings, they met people from
another place, they spoke different languages and could not
understand one another. This is why there are now many
different centres of population, many tribes, and many lan-
guages. Before the Ô¨Çood there was but one centre, for all the
people lived together in one country and spoke one language.
The creation story recorded in the Ô¨Årst chapters of Genesis has
God allotting basic names for day, night, heaven, and earth, and
Adam, the Ô¨Årst human, assigning names to fauna (and presumably
everything else). The language used by God, Adam, Eve, and the
132
secret language
serpent is not speciÔ¨Åed, but is naturally taken to be Hebrew, the
language of those telling the story.4
Later, chapter eleven states that
‚Äòthe whole earth was of one language, and of one speech‚Äô until God
punished the people for building a tower to reach heaven (the
Tower of Babel) by scattering them and ‚Äòconfound[ing] their
language, that they may not understand one another‚Äôs speech‚Äô.
This story reÔ¨Çects a belief that Hebrew is the original language
and it gave rise to a belief in the special potency of the Hebrew
language. The third-century Christian scholar Origen, for instance,
believed Hebrew names had power in their original form, but lost it
in transliteration or translation (Skemer 2006: 96).
This way of thinking became prominent among scholars in the
Kabbalah tradition. One Hebrew text in circulation among Kab-
balists was the Sefer Yetzirah ‚ÄòBook of Creation‚Äô (also Sepher
Yetzirah). It was attributed to Abraham, but probably dates from
around the beginning of the Christian era. It contains the view that
the universe was created by God through the letters of the Hebrew
alphabet. One might ask who created the letters, but even setting
that aside we are left with a world view that ascribes primacy to
language, including the written form of language, over everything
else in the universe (Winslade 2000: 84).
Kabbalah ideas about the Hebrew language became inÔ¨Çuential
in Christian Europe in the Renaissance through the writings of
scholars such as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463‚Äì94), Johann
Reuchlin (1455‚Äì1522), and Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nette-
sheim (1486‚Äì1535). A particularly pervasive belief was that there
4

God and Adam, it is not a universal view.
133
words of power
was an inherent connection between Hebrew words and their
referents. The following quotation from Manuel do Valle de
Mouro, a sixteenth-century Portuguese theologian, captures the
essence of this (Maxwell-Stuart 1999: 137).5
The art of the Kabbalah is a Jewish tradition. The Jews believe
that the predilections, conditions, powers and faculties of innu-
merable things are contained in Hebrew names in such a way
that if anyone were to invoke properly the whole power of the
Hebrew names, letters, accents and so forth, he could accom-
plish many extraordinary things. They claim that these same
utterances create power over the whole universe, nature, evil
spirits, angels and God himself, and that this happened because
God himself or Adam, both of whom enjoyed the attributes of
immortality and wisdom, gave things their substances, qualities,
conditions, properties and descriptive names. Consequently,
things are under the immediate control of the person who
calls them by their names . . .
The view that one can exercise control via words is widespread, but
this passage expresses a conviction that Hebrew embodies a unique
connection between words and their referents, because Hebrew
names are the real, original names.
It is easy nowadays to see this notion as misguided. Hebrew is
just one of a number of Semitic languages and is not even the most
conservative or nearest to Proto-Semitic, the ancestral form of
Semitic. This only became clear with the development of historical
linguistics in the nineteenth century, but even before that time
there were those who viewed the notions stemming from the
Kabbalah sceptically. A seventeenth-century Spanish writer, Fran-
cisco Torreblanca Villalpando, wrote, ‚Äò . . . for it is incredible that

134
secret language
the sun, moon and other stars, the elements and things derived
from them, since they lack reason, feel that divine power which lies
hidden in Hebrew words, and are so affected thereby and so moved
that they obey a person simply because he wills it . . . It must be said
that no name, whether pronounced mentally or aloud, naturally
and of themselves have such a power‚Äô (quoted in Maxwell-Stuart
1999: 138). Villalpando had his own theory about uniquely powerful
language, however. He went on to contrast ‚ÄòKabbalistic words‚Äô with
the words used in Christian sacraments, which he regarded as
possessing a power with which they were endowed by Christ.
As we saw in Chapter 1, all societies believe in the supernatural,
and all societies believe they have means of contacting the spirit
world. It is common to avoid offending spirits and so avert
misfortune or to seek to win their favour in obtaining cures,
fertility, prosperity, and success in Ô¨Ånding a partner. People
frequently ask for help in defeating their enemies, which directly
or indirectly involves the use of curses. A curse may be laid on an
individual or a group of people, on animals, plants, or land.
Misfortune may be invoked in the form of failed crops, famine,
Ô¨Åre, Ô¨Çood, injury, or disease. In the culture of Ancient Greece and
Rome it was common to inscribe curses on thin sheets of lead.
These were buried near the home of a target or placed in a grave in
the hope of enlisting help from the spirit of the departed. The
graves of those who had suffered untimely deaths or had not been
given the proper burial rites were favoured, since it was thought
their spirits were likely to remain in the vicinity of the grave.
These curse tablets, known as katadesmoi in Greek and deÔ¨Åxiones
in Latin, were directed at adversaries in business, the theatre, and
the courts. From the second century ad onwards they were used
135
words of power
against competitors in sport. A number of deÔ¨Åxiones unearthed
from the Roman empire are aimed at competitors in chariot races
and their horses, and have been found buried near stadiums. Early
curse tablets from as far back as the fourth century bc are designed
to get rid of an unwanted partner or lover; from the second century
ad onwards there are similar texts for acquiring a partner or lover
(Ogden 1999: 4, 24). If the target is a woman, the curse may involve
barrenness, miscarriage, or the birth of deformed children.
Another type of curse is one that is placed on a thief who has
stolen someone‚Äôs property. A number of curse tablets excavated
from Bath, England, are of this type. The victim asks a deity to
afÔ¨Çict the thief, whose identity may not be known, and to recover
the stolen goods (Gager 1992: 93‚Äì4). Curses may also be directed
against a potential transgressor. This is common in the Bible. The
last verses of Revelation place a curse on anybody who adds to or
subtracts from the foregoing text (Rev. 22:18‚Äì19):
If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him
the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall
take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God
shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the
holy city, and from the things which were written in this book.
Methods of trying to contact or inÔ¨Çuence the spirit world have
varied from culture to culture, but there are common themes.
There is often a requirement that the person making contact is
cleansed in some way by sexual abstinence, fasting, or, as in the
case of Indian culture, long-term asceticism. A ritual often involves
cleansing by Ô¨Åre, smoke, or water, and where sacriÔ¨Åcial victims are
used, they have to be virgin or unblemished. Timing is often
signiÔ¨Åcant and account is taken of such phenomena as the phases
136
secret language
of the moon or the conjunction of the planets and Ô¨Åxed constel-
lations. Where a potion is produced to cure or induce harm, it may
involve using substances ranging from herbs to the body parts and
efÔ¨Çuvia of humans and animals.
A number of grimoires or handbooks of magic are extant from
the Middle Ages and Renaissance, including the Liber Iuratus or
Sworn Book of Honorius (thirteenth century), the Munich Hand-
book (Ô¨Åfteenth century), Libri Tres de Occulta Philosophia by Hein-
rich Cornelius Agrippa (1531), the Greater Key of Solomon (sixteenth
century), and the Lesser Key of Solomon (seventeenth century).
These combine ancient pagan procedures for magic with Judaeo-
Christian beliefs and texts. Shakespeare captures the essence of this
type of magic in Macbeth (IV. 1), when the witches recite a long and
imaginative recipe for a ‚Äòhell-broth‚Äô to enlist the aid of evil spirits.
Note the use of body parts of creatures that pose a threat to
humans, a body part from a victim of infanticide by a prostitute
(drab), and the addition of poison (hemlock). The hemlock root has
been obtained at night and the gall of goat and slips of yew have
been gathered during an eclipse of the moon, a most unpropitious
time. The Christian element lies in the inclusion of body parts of
various non-Christian peoples, who are considered evil.

In the ancient Near East some illnesses were interpreted as the
result of possession by an evil spirit, and exorcism sometimes involved
the use of an animal or an efÔ¨Ågy of the victim as a substitute host for
the illness. The ritual was intended to transfer the evil spirit from the
victim to the animal or efÔ¨Ågy.In the New Testament there isa story of
Christ casting out evil spirits from humans and transferring the spirits
to a new host, namely pigs (Matthew 8:28‚Äì33). In Mesopotamia
human substitutes were sometimes used for kings thought to be in
danger because of an ill omen such as a lunar eclipse. The king would
be dethroned and a substitute put in his place. The substitute king
would be killed to fulÔ¨Ål the assumed prophecy and then the real king
would be restored. On one occasion the real king died anyway and the
substitute, who had been a gardener, retained the throne (Thomsen
2001: 71‚Äì6). There is something quaint about the notion of deceiving
the spirit world by using a substitute, but stories of dealings with the
supernatural are full of literal interpretations. A similar principle
applies to traditional taboos. A person who breaks a taboo is usually
treated as guilty even if the transgression is accidental or made in
ignorance. Laws must be obeyed to the letter.
Almost all procedures for communicating with the supernatural
use language, and it is this component that interests us here. It may

be a matter of letters or characters, of words, formulas, or other
short passages, or even whole works. Sacred words may have a
status similar to that of sacred objects, but with more versatility.
Verbal cures might be spoken in a patient‚Äôs ear, or, if written,
might be placed in contact with a patient‚Äôs body or inscribed on
food and eaten.
Letters and Symbols
To those unfamiliar with the medium writing can seem mysterious
and possessed of magical powers. In literate societies not everyone
can read, and this was particularly true in the past. Over the last two
millennia those involved in magic have exploited the mystique
writing holds, particularly for the illiterate, by using alphabets such
as the Hebrew one or devising new alphabets. This was especially
common during the Renaissance, when a number of derivatives of
the Hebrew alphabet were introduced, such as the Malachim alpha-
bet and the Celestial or Angelic alphabet. The latter was so called
because the shapes of the letters were discerned in the pattern of
constellations, on the same principle as the signs of the Zodiac
(Agrippa 1992, Book III: 30).8
More recently J.R.R. Tolkien devised
an alphabet called Tengwar, which he used in The Hobbit and Lord of
the Rings. He also used Germanic runes, an alphabet which is often
associated with magic (see below).
When writing is introduced into a culture, one of its Ô¨Årst uses is to
record secret and sacred words. According to Ostler (2007: 44‚Äì5),
8
Other alphabets to be found in Agrippa are the Theban and the
Transitus Fluvii ‚ÄòPassing the River‚Äô, as it is normally translated. There is
also the Alphabet of the Magi devised by Paracelsus and the Enochian
139
words of power
‚ÄòAs in many cases of early literacy, the offer of writing to the Romans
was not taken up as a chance to begin literature; for them, as for their
Etruscan tutors, the Ô¨Årst writing seems to have been a means of
making spells or formulas effective by setting them down on a
permanent medium‚Äô. Writing not only allows for a permanent
record of a text that is meant to be recited, it also provides the
possibility of a text that operates in written form, as with the words
in an amulet or charm.
Writing developed from pictograms and ideograms, and the use
of logographic symbols has continued in parallel with writing
proper. Commonplace examples include the international symbols
for male and female toilets and the more localized symbols used by
itinerants to indicate to fellow travellers the reception they can
expect in given premises. These may be iconic, for example a loaf
of bread to indicate the likelihood of food, or apparently arbitrary
as with a dot inside a circle \ to indicate the possibility of the
police being called (Ward 1957: 138). At a more elevated level are
the auspicious symbols in several Indian religions, particularly
Buddhism. They include the endless knot, the parasol, the lotus
Ô¨Çower, the swastika, and the dharma wheel.
In the Roman empire and in Europe over the last two millennia
texts with a supernatural orientation have often been accompanied
by non-linguistic symbols, many of which have no identiÔ¨Åable origin
or meaning. Some of the better-known ones are illustrated in the box
below. To these we could add the cross in various forms, which for
Christians has long been a symbol of great power. This is epitomized
devised by John Dee (the court astrologer to Elizabeth I and James I) and
his assistant, Edward Kelley. Further information and illustration of all the
alphabets mentioned is available on the Web.

in Bram Stoker‚Äôs Dracula, where Count Dracula shrinks from the
sight of the cross and is rendered powerless, but the cross also
Ô¨Ågures prominently in Christian legend. One such story concerns
Constantine, the Ô¨Årst Roman emperor to grant ofÔ¨Åcial recognition
to Christianity. According to Eusebius Constantine saw a vision of
the cross with the words En tout≈ç nika (¬Ø ƒ±	√∏ Àù√ò≈í√Ü) ‚ÄòIn this

Constantine‚Äôs army adopted the sign and conquered the rival
army of Maxentius, thereby winning the imperial crown (Life of
Constantine 28). Constantine is also reported to have used another
Christian symbol, the chi-rho, which consisted of the Ô¨Årst two
letters of Christ‚Äôs name in Greek superimposed on one another
(see box).
The ancient Egyptian ANKH symbolized reproduction and
life. It has come into widespread use in popular culture
since the 1960s, possibly helped by the 1954 Ô¨Ålm The Egyptian.

141
words of power
Letters seem to have a fascination quite apart from their prac-
tical use in notating words. The curse tablets of the Greek and
Roman worlds contain partial alphabets, words written out in
patterns, and the use of letter-like characters (Ogden 1999: 8,
48‚Äì9). In one form of palmistry described by Bartolomeo della
Rocca (1467‚Äì1504) letter shapes were picked out in the lines of the
palm and each letter was taken to be a predictor of character and
fortune.9
Letters and other symbols can be combined. In some medieval
charms words were written in the form of a cross. For instance, a
twelfth-century English charm for nose-bleeding reads, ‚ÄòFor blood
running from the nose, write on their forehead in the form of a
cross stomen calcos, stomen metaroru‚Äô. This is a distorted form of the
Greek st≈çmen kal≈çs, st≈çmen meta thobou (theou) ‚ÄòLet us stay
good, let us stay in fear (of God)‚Äô. The Ô¨Årst phrase is written
vertically and the second written horizontally, intersecting it
(Barb 1948: 39).
The Germanic people acquired a form of alphabet around the
second century ad (Figure 26). Its exact origin is disputed; it shows
resemblances to the Roman alphabet and other Italic alphabets as
well as the Greek alphabet. The letters were known as runes and the
alphabet is often referred to as the runic alphabet. It is also known as
the futhark (Scandinavian version) or futhork (Anglo-Saxon version),
this name deriving from the Ô¨Årst six letters of the alphabet, the
digraph th representing a single letter √æ (thorn). The runes were used
mostly for inscriptions carved on leather or bone to record owner-
ship or on stone to record the memory of the dead. Various forms of
9

the runic alphabet continued to be used for inscriptions even after
the Germanic people were introduced to the Roman alphabet.
In Germanic countries runes remain in use for ornamental purposes
and as signature-like markers in the present day, and there has been
a revival of interest among New Agers with an interest in the occult
because runic writing is believed to be connected with magic. The
name rune (r≈´n in Old English) means ‚Äòsecret‚Äô or ‚Äòmystery‚Äô and the
runic alphabet is strongly associated with magic in the Norse sagas.
When one considers that runes were the Ô¨Årst form of writing to be
introduced to the Germanic people it is not surprising that they
were attributed magic properties.
It seems that individual runes were considered to possess magic
properties. A possible early reference can be found in Tacitus,
writing in the Ô¨Årst century ad. He notes that the Germans prac-
tised the following custom (Germania 10):
Virgam frugiferae arbori decisam in surculos amputant eosque
notis quibusdam discretos super candidam vestem temere ac
fortuito spargunt. Mox, si publice consultetur, sacerdos civita-
tis, sin privatim, ipse pater familiae, precatus deos caelumque
suspiciens ter singulos tollit, sublatos secundum impressam
ante notam interpretatur.
They cut off the branch of a fruit-tree and separate the twigs,
mark them with distinct characters and sprinkle them at
random on a white garment. Then, the priest, if it is a public
consultation, or the paterfamilias, if it is a private one, praying
to the gods and looking up to the sky takes three, one at a
time, and interprets them on the basis of the characters that
were inscribed on them.
Tossing twigs in the air and choosing three at random gives the
spirits scope to indicate whether or not a venture is likely to
143
words of power
succeed. If the characters were alphabetic they were probably
runes, but they may have been non-language symbols.
In Egil‚Äôs Saga, set in the eleventh century, when Egil Skalla-
grimsson is handed a poisoned brew he stabs his hand, cuts runes
on the drinking horn, and rubs his blood into the grooves. The
horn splits, the poisoned brew is spilt, and Egil is thus saved
(chapter 44). The saga does not record the particular runes used,
but it distinctly states that Egil carved ‚Äòrunes‚Äô rather than ‚Äòwords‚Äô.
In the Old Norse poem Sk√≠rnism√°l there is a clearer reference to
the use of speciÔ¨Åc runes having power. Skirnir is sent to woo
Gerthr on behalf of his master, the god Freyr. It is a wooing
consisting mostly of threats and verse 37 is as follows,
√ûurs r√≠st ek √æ√©r Thurs I carve
ok √ær√≠a staÔ¨Å, and three other runes,
ergi ok √¶√∞i ok √≥√æola; Lust, frenzy, and frustration.
sv√° ek √æat af r√≠st, As I carve on,
sem ek √æat √° reist, so I carve off
ef gerask √æarfar √æess. If need be.
Here Skirnir tells Gerthr that he has carved thurs (a rune) and three
other runes, each of which relates to a mental state. If she does not

and lack of satisfaction, but Skirnir points out that he can destroy
the carving and thereby abort the curse.10
One curious practice in the Middle Ages and later was to
inscribe letters, whether runic or roman, on dice and then use
the dice to stamp cakes given to rabid dogs in an attempt to cure
them (cf. Elliott 1957: 259).
A different combination of letters and dice featured in a form of
divination practised in the Roman Empire and later in Europe.
Letters were inscribed on small tiles and the tiles were selected in
turn by the fall of dice, so that the resulting words were produced
by chance. A variant of this system involved selection of tiles by
domestic fowl or pre-literate children (Flint 1991: 218).
Magic Words and Formulas
In western culture we tend not to take the idea of magic words and
formulas seriously. Secret magic formulas are none the less a
recurring motif of folk tales. In Lithuania and Latvia there are
stories of a maiden taken away by a snake to the bottom of a lake to
marry a man who is both snake and prince. After bearing him three
children she is given permission to visit her family, and the prince

There was one ‚Äòsecret‚Äô connected with runes and that was the
practice of sometimes indicating them by their place in the alphabet.
For instance, the twenty-four-character version of the runic alphabet was
arranged in three rows of eight, as in Figure 26, and a letter could be
designated by its row number and position number. These numbers could
be indicated by offshoots on either side of a stem or by Ô¨Åns on either side
of a Ô¨Åsh (Lowe 2006: 688).

gives her and the children a magic formula which will enable them
to return. Not wanting her to go back to the lake, her family get
the children to reveal the formula, which they then use to summon
the prince from the depths and kill him (Brad≈´nas 1975).
Open sesame! is familiar as the magic formula that opens the cave
Ô¨Ålled with treasure in Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and abraca-
dabra is the stock example of a magic word, popular with profes-
sional magicians. Abracadabra appears in De medicina praecepta by
Quintus Serenus Sammonicus, a learned writer of the late second
century ad, but it is not Latin and its origin is unclear. It may have
a Semitic origin, perhaps in the Aramaic phrase avra kehdabra ‚ÄòI
will create as I speak‚Äô.11
Abracadabra is typical of the language of
magic, Ô¨Årst, because it is meaningless and second, because it
features internal repetition, namely of the segment abra. Full and
partial reduplication are common in magic language, as are
rhythm, rhyme, alliteration, assonance, and swapping of sounds
as in spoonerisms (Keane 1997: 53; Roper 2003a: 9).12
These qual-
ities are illustrated among the variants of a medieval formula to be
used against the bite of a mad dog. These include Pax Max D Inax
and Pax, Max, Y, Vy, Vax. Pax is ‚Äòpeace‚Äô in Latin and max is
presumably an abbreviation of maxima ‚Äògreatest‚Äô. The rest seems to
be gibberish, but note the jingly rhyme (Elliott 1957: 260).
An early example of gibberish and word play can be found in the
De Agricultura (160) of Cato the Elder (second century bc), where

kedavra, is a variation of avra kehdabra.

napiter must be recited during the binding process and the formula
huat huat huat ista sistas sistar dannabou dannaustra must be recited
every day until the fracture mends.
As we saw on page 16, in Ancient Greece and Rome it became
increasingly common as time went on to use magic words (voces
magicae) or words of mystery (voces mysteriae), as they were known
(Gager 1992: 6). These include the so-called Ephesian letters,
askion, kataskion, lix, tetrax, damnameneus, and aision (Ogden
1999: 47). They are words that do not make sense in Greek or
Latin and they may well stem from an older language such as
Egyptian or Akkadian. If so, they had probably become garbled
and assimilated to yield plausible Greek forms. Some magic words
appear to be made up from Greek roots, for instance hippochthon
from hippos ‚Äòhorse‚Äô and chthon ‚Äòearth‚Äô.13
The practice of using voces magicae continued in Europe through-
out the Middle Ages and Renaissance. A Ô¨Åfteenth-century manu-
script from Wolsthurn Castle in the Tyrol gives a number of recipes,
procedures, and texts for cures. To exorcize a demon a priest should
recite the following mixture of Latin, Greek, and meaningless gib-
berish into the ear of the possessed (Kieckhefer 1989: 4):
Amara Tonta Tyra post hos Ô¨Årabis Ô¨Åcaliri Elypolis starras poly
polyque lique linarras buccabor uel barton v el Titram celi

With the spread of Christianity in Europe pagan charms were
replaced by Christian prayers, although the distinction is not

always clear. Consider the following fourteenth-century text to be
recited over a patient suffering toothache (Jolly 2002: 41). Prayers
continued a practice common in charms, namely that of listing,
but whereas pagan charms often listed a number of gods or spirits,
Christian prayers often list Hebrew, Greek, and Latin epithets
applying to Christ. These are often garbled, as in this example,
indicating that users did not understand them completely.

standard formulaic ending for a prayer. Some of these epithets seem
natural enough, but others such as leo, vermis, vitulus, aries, and
serpens, which appear odd to us, ‚ÄòreÔ¨Çect a learned tradition of types
that is especially developed in twelfth-century sermons and mys-
tical thought‚Äô (Olsan 1992: 129).14
This example provides a good illustration of the distortion that
occurs when words are passed down through generations who are
unfamiliar with the languages involved, a distortion that can also
be observed in the transmission of rhymes and lyrics. But however
garbled they might be, unfamiliar words doubtless had a certain
value by the very fact that they were mysterious and seemed to
have an exotic heritage. In some instances the distortion may have
been deliberate. To quote Aristotle, ‚ÄòDiscourse must be made to
sound exotic, for men are admirers of what is distant‚Äô (Rhetoric
1404b). Many of the recorded magic texts were written by profes-
sional workers of magic (Greek magoi, Latin magi) and these
magicians doubtless found it useful to impress their clients with
some kind of mysterious mumbo jumbo.15
Pagan and Christian elements continued to be mixed long
after Christianity became dominant in Europe. In the Anglo-
Saxon Nine Herbs Charm from the tenth or eleventh century a
reference to a myth in which Woden kills a snake occurs along-
side a reference to Christ having formed two herbs, chervil and
fennel, when he was on the cross (Lacnunga LXXIX‚ÄìLXXXII in

A number of prayers similar to the one quoted here consist of a string
of Greek and Latin words that can apply to Christ. These include gloria
‚Äòglory‚Äô, panis ‚Äòbread‚Äô, pastor ‚Äòshepherd‚Äô, propheta ‚Äòprophet‚Äô, via ‚Äòway‚Äô, and
vita ‚Äòlife‚Äô. See, for instance, Hymn 71 in Hewett (ed.) 1861: 54.

Pettit ed. 2001; Weston 1995: 279). A similar confusion of pagan
and Christian lore characterizes an Old English text setting down
the ritual for restoring land that has been bewitched. It involves
taking samples of soil and produce and having Christian prayers
said over them, partly in Old English and partly in Latin, but
some of the instructions are clearly pre-Christian. The samples
have to be taken before dawn (on niht aer hyt dagige) and one
must recite prayers facing east and then turning in the direction
of the sun (sunganges). In northern Europe actions carried out in
the direction of the sun were supposed to produce a favourable
result, while those carried out in the opposite direction
(wythers √êynes ‚Äòwiddershins‚Äô) were thought to produce the opposite
result. The church adopted numerous pagan practices designed
to invoke supernatural protection of crops and livestock or to
guarantee fertility. Samples of produce such as milk and honey
were taken to mass and blessed with appropriate Bible passages
such as ‚ÄòBe fruitful and multiply‚Äô (Genesis 1:22).16
The Christian prayer quoted above lists epithets that apply to
Christ in the fashion of a litany. The words are deemed appropriate
but are presumably not thought to possess any intrinsic power.
However, Renaissance scholars who embraced the Kabbalah
believed in the power of Hebrew names, above all yhwh, the sacred
name of God. Johann Reuchlin (1455‚Äì1522) in his De Verbo MiriÔ¨Åco
(On the Wonder-Working Word, 1494) developed the fanciful
notion that the name of Jesus was even more powerful. He wrote

Pagan practices survived alongside Christian ones. The church never
managed to eradicate ‚Äòmagic‚Äô. Flint (1991: 394ff.) argues that the church
deliberately tolerated some traditional practices so as not to alienate
people.

yhwh as ihuh (taking the vocalic values of the semi-vowels) and
Jesus as ihsuh and noted that ihuh contained no true consonants
since God was spirit, but ihsuh contained a true consonant because
Jesus was God made Ô¨Çesh (Zika 1976: 132; Kieckhefer 1989: 149).17
Agrippa von Nettesheim (1486‚Äì1535) took up this view and suggested
that Jesus, the most efÔ¨Åcacious of all names, could be used in amulets
(Shumaker 1972: 135, 149‚Äì50). The four-letter Hebrew name of God
was known as the Tetragrammaton and the word Tetragrammaton
was sometimes inserted in late medieval and Renaissance prayers as a
kind of Christian equivalent of a magic word. During the course of
the Ô¨Årst millennium the three magi who Ô¨Ågure in Matthew‚Äôs account
of Christ‚Äôs nativity acquired names: Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar.
Eventually these names came to be inserted in prayers, as if their very
inclusion increased the efÔ¨Åcacy of the prayer.18
Some of the tendencies noted above, namely the use of mys-
terious words, often garbled, and the mixing of the pre-Christian
and Christian, survived until fairly recently and may persist today.
In nineteenth-century Yorkshire a charm against witches included
pentagrams, the words Alga [Agla], El, Naglah, Adonai, and Sadai,
and the phrases Hoc in vince ‚ÄòIn this [sign] conquer‚Äô and Jesu
Christi Rex Judaeorum ‚ÄòJesus Christ, King of the Jews‚Äô (Rushton
1980: 117). After the Reformation Latin was largely conÔ¨Åned to the
Roman church, at least in religious contexts, and became a lan-
guage of voces mysticae, a wholly mysterious language. In the eyes

In The Art of the Kabbalah Reuchlin wrote, ‚ÄòThe tetragrammaton is
sufÔ¨Åcient in itself to perform miracles and prodigies . . . a name through
which a man can effect miracles, by accounting as a fellow-worker and as a
delegate from God‚Äô (1993: 308‚Äì9).

of some Protestants it was often associated with superstition even
when used in church ritual, but as can be seen from the charm just
quoted it was also used outside the church context.
Texts of Power
Literate cultures generally contain large sacred texts such as the
Egyptian Book of the Dead, the Vedas, the Bible, and the
Qur‚Äôan, or texts venerated for their wisdom, such as The Ana-
lects of Confucius, or as a source of divination, such as the ancient
Chinese I Ching (Y√¨ J
ng in Pinyin) or ‚ÄòBook of Changes‚Äô. With
the passage of time the language in which these works are
written falls out of general use. The Hebrew of the Torah was
not the spoken language of the Jews after the Babylonian
captivity of the sixth century bc. By this time they were speak-
ing Aramaic, the lingua franca of the area, but they retained
Hebrew as a written language and continued to use it in ritual,
as they still do.
Where a religion that begins among the speakers of one lan-
guage is taken up by speakers of another language, the language of
the texts will naturally be unfamiliar. In the Roman empire Greek
came to be the language used in various religions, including
Zoroastrianism, which originated in Persia, and the worship of
Isis and Osiris from Egypt. Greek was also the medium for
Christianity for several centuries, and although it was widely
spoken in the eastern parts of the empire, Latin was the vernacular
of the west. From the second century Christian texts began to be
translated into Latin and by the fourth century Latin was the
language of the church. A few centuries later vernacular Latin
152
secret language
had split and developed into what were to become the Romance
languages, and church Latin became incomprehensible. Where
Christianity spread to areas such as Ireland, where Latin had
never been spoken, or countries where it had ceased to be spoken,
such as England in the Ô¨Åfth century, Latin was of course a foreign
language. The Qur‚Äôan and other sacred writings of Islam are in the
Arabic of the seventh century, which has come to be called
Classical Arabic in distinction from the modern varieties. The
Qur‚Äôan is held to be the word of God transmitted by the Archangel
Gabriel to Muhammad. There is a reluctance to translate it and
Muslims are expected to learn Classical Arabic. Even where sacred
texts are translated, discrepancies between the translation and the
vernacular can arise with language change. The Authorized Ver-
sion of the English Bible is in sixteenth-century English and
remained in use until the twentieth century despite becoming
badly out of kilter with even the written form of the language.
The short sentence hallowed be thy name contains an archaic
subjunctive construction with be, the obsolete thy, and hallowed,
which is of marginal currency in contemporary English.
Religious works contain rules of conduct (Thou shalt not kill )
and exhortations to virtue (Love thy neighbour) of which the
faithful need to be reminded. In Deuteronomy God commands
the Jews as follows:
Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they
may be as frontlets between your eyes.
And thou shalt write them on the door posts of thine house,
and upon thy gates. (Deuteronomy 11:18, 20; see also 6:8, 9,
Exodus 13:9 and 13:16, and Proverbs 7:3)

This led to the Jewish practice of wearing black leather boxes,
tƒõÔ¨Åll
n or phylacteries, containing biblical texts on the head and
left arm when praying.19
In Jewish, Christian, and Islamic cultures
it is common for short passages from the sacred texts to be
displayed on public buildings or in the home. Sometimes they
are used as headings for or as frames around correspondence or
other written work.
Given that they are considered to be divinely inspired, texts
such as the Bible and the Qur‚Äôan have often been credited with
power, even miraculous power. This can be a matter of using the
physical text as a means of healing, for instance, placing a Bible in
contact with sick or injured persons or giving them a short text to
eat. More often it is a matter of employing passages of such texts in
the abstract sense in prayers, blessings, consecrations, and the like.
Among the Jews the Torah-scroll was sometimes brought in to a
woman in labour or laid against a sick baby, but such practices
were not conÔ¨Åned to Jews. A Ô¨Åfteenth-century manuscript from
Wolsthurn Castle in the Tyrol gives a number of recipes, proced-
ures, and texts for cures. For menstrual problems a piece of
parchment was to be inscribed with a short text from the mass,
per ipsum et cum ipso et in ipso ‚Äòthrough Him and with Him and in
Him‚Äô, and placed on the woman‚Äôs forehead (Kieckhefer 1989: 4).
Pedro Manuel, archbishop of Leon 1523‚Äì34, condemning diviners
who ‚Äòhave access to secrets which it is for God alone to know, and
enter a circle wherein they invoke evil spirits‚Äô, mentions that they
wrote ‚Äòforbidden‚Äô words on lumps and swellings in the belief that

these would relieve the problem.20
Toothache charms and prayers
like the one illustrated in the previous section were often tied to
the patient‚Äôs head (Olsan 1992: 120). These are examples of what
Frazer might have called contagious magic, magic by contact
(Frazer 1911a: 174‚Äì219), although they differ from sorcery involving
corporeal matter, bodily efÔ¨Çuvia, or footprints. With religious texts
what is important is the supposed divine origin of the words. Their
power to heal can be directed to a target by contact.
Over the whole period of written records from Ancient Meso-
potamia down there are references to evil being spread by contact
with dirty water or herbs or by the ingestion of poisoned food or
water, most of which presumably have a rational explanation. Less
rational is touching someone with a severed male organ from a bird
or animal noted for its reproductive capacity in an attempt to
increase potency or fertility. Touching with sacred texts can be
seen as an analogous practice.
In literate cultures it has been common to place short texts in
amulets or talismans.21
Amulets are found in most, if not all,
cultures (Budge 1978: 1). An amulet is meant to provide protection
from some misfortune such as sickness, disease, or death. Some
amulets are for special purposes such as protecting a pregnant
woman from miscarriage or guarding against a difÔ¨Åcult birth or
defective offspring, some are to guard against wild animals or bites
from snakes, scorpions, or spiders, and some are to provide protec-
tion from the elements or ensure fertility of crops or animals. Others
again are used to provide protection for those on a journey or

anyone in a boat. An amulet is usually worn hung around the neck
or attached to clothing, but some amulets are placed in dwellings or
in vehicles (like a St Christopher medal). An amulet may simply
contain herbs or stones thought to have magic properties, but many
contained writing on papyrus, parchment, or paper, or inscribed on
metal or gemstones. The writing could be a symbol such as a
triangle or a pentagram, a name, or a short text. Among the Jews
appropriate biblical texts were used, such as ‚ÄòI will put none of these
diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians, for I
am the Lord that healeth thee‚Äô (Exodus 15:26) or ‚ÄòThou shalt not be
afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that Ô¨Çieth by day; nor
for the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction
that walketh at noonday‚Äô (Psalm 91:5‚Äì6). In recent times modern
technology has been employed to make miniature versions of books
of the Bible and the Qur‚Äôan small enough to be worn in pendants,
although this is not a solely recent innovation. A very small version
of John‚Äôs gospel dating to the Ô¨Åfth or sixth century has been
preserved. It measures approximately two by three inches and was
presumably used as an amulet (Skemer 2006: 87).
The use of pagan amulets was condemned by the church (Flint
1991: 244), and even the use of biblical texts as a cure or prophylactic
did not always enjoy the approval of the church. Augustine con-
demned the practice of placing the gospel of John on people suffer-
ing from headaches, fever, and other afÔ¨Çictions. The Ô¨Årst fourteen
verses of John‚Äôs gospel formed a favourite text in amulets. Aquinas
believed that physical texts could be used as a mnemonic, but were
not sufÔ¨Åcient in themselves. One needed to have the words in one‚Äôs
heart and soul, as prescribed in Deuteronomy 11:18 (see above). With
any religious text or objet there is always the danger that it will
156
secret language
be treated as a fetish. Not surprisingly, Luther condemned the use of
biblical texts in amulets (Skemer 2006: 63‚Äì5, 67, 87).
In addition to placing physical texts in contiguity with ill or
injured persons, it was also common to recite charms or prayers
into the ears or mouth of a patient. The aim was to achieve
penetration of the words into the patient‚Äôs body, so a natural
extension of the practice was to make Christian texts in edible
form and administer them to patients (Clark 2002: 100). The pax
max texts used against the bite of a mad dog (see p. 146) were
inscribed on apples or bread and given to the dogs to eat (Elliott
1957: 260). A twelfth-century manuscript from Germany recom-
mends writing prayers on wafers and eating them barefoot, an
interesting blend of the Christian and pagan (Kieckhefer 1989: 70).
In the Anglo-Saxon Leechbook (lxii) a prescription for overcoming
fever involves writing the opening words of the Vulgate version of
John‚Äôs gospel (In principio erat verbum ‚ÄòIn the beginning was the
Word‚Äô) on a paten and washing them into a drink. In a later
manuscript they are to be written on parchment and scraped
into a bowl and administered to a person thought to be possessed
by a demon (Kieckhefer 1989: 74). The choice of words in this case
is motivated by the part-for-whole principle, the Ô¨Årst words of a
text bringing to mind a larger text. The power of words can also be
seen in a practice reported of Swedish peasants, who would tear a
page from the psalter, bake it in dough, and feed it to cattle
believed to be the victims of witchcraft (Ullmann 1957: 43).22

In China it has been the custom to ingest written words by writing
them on rice paper and eating the paper or by burning the paper and
putting the ashes in food.

In traditional Christian belief and still in the teaching of the
Catholic and Orthodox churches a priest can turn bread and wine
into the body and blood of Christ by using the words ‚ÄòThis is my
body‚Äô and ‚ÄòThis is my blood‚Äô.23
The consecrated bread or host
became a valued source of power, and hosts were sometimes stolen
and given to humans and livestock to cure a complaint or ward off
disease. The value of the host could be enhanced by writing biblical
texts on it (Kieckhefer 1989: 79). Consecrated hosts were also stolen
for blasphemous purposes including black masses. The doctrine of
transubstantiation has points in common with instances of super-
natural metamorphosis in pagan and traditional mythology.
One form of charm refers to an event in which some heroic
Ô¨Ågure overcame an enemy or a malevolent force. With the spread
of Christianity this genre took its heroes from the Bible or the lives
of saints. In some cases a short narrative was included in the
charm, and such charms are referred to as ‚Äònarrative charms‚Äô, but
in other cases a mere reference to a story was considered sufÔ¨Åcient,
since the story would have been well known to the patient or any
other audience. A curious fact about Christian narrative charms is
their propensity to use apocryphal accretions to Bible stories or
entirely apocryphal stories.24
For instance, there are numerous
versions of a charm against toothache, which relates an apocryphal
23
In Latin the words of consecration of the bread are Hoc est enim corpus
meum ‚ÄòFor this is my body‚Äô (lit. this is for body mine). It has been suggested
that this lies behind the mock Latin phrase hocus pocus used by conjurors.
Some people are sceptical about this etymology, but it has some plausibility,
particularly as it converts the near rhyme in hoc est and corpus to a true rhyme.

story of Christ curing St Peter‚Äôs toothache. The following example
is from nineteenth-century Lancashire. It is a written charm meant
to be worn under the clothing (Roper 2003a: 23). The Latin Ô¨Åat
means ‚ÄòMay it be‚Äô and the cross symbols are an indication that the
sign of the cross is to be made at the points where it occurs.
Ass Saint Peter sat at the geats of Jerusalem, our Blessed Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ pased by and sead: What eleth thee, he
said Lord my Teeth ecketh. Hee sead arise and folow me and
thy Teeth shall never Eake Eney moor. Fiat V Fiat V Fiat.
St Apollonia was also invoked in cures for toothache because she
had been tortured by having her teeth ripped out. The use of these
texts was often accompanied by the sprinkling of holy water on the
patient, and, as with the charms and prayers against toothache
mentioned earlier, the text was placed in contact with the afÔ¨Çicted
area of the body.
Another common charm was the Veronica charm, which was
used to staunch bleeding ranging from a nose bleed to excessive
menstrual bleeding. Here is an example (Barb 1948: 43):
In the name of Christ write on the forehead with the [patient‚Äôs]
own blood the name of Veronica. The same it is who said: If I
touch the fringe of the garment of my Lord I shall be healed.
The reference is to the haemorrhaging woman who was cured by
touching the hem of Christ‚Äôs garment (Matthew 9:20, Mark 5:25,
and Luke 8:44). In later tradition she was given the name Veronica
and identiÔ¨Åed with the apocryphal woman who placed a cloth on
the face of Christ as he carried his cross to Calvary, and who
received a miraculous imprint of Christ‚Äôs face on her cloth.

Supernatural powers have often been consulted about the future
and when sacred texts are used as a source of such divination the
practice is known as bibliomancy. This is quite different from
referring to a work such as I Ching, which is explicitly concerned
with divination. In its most primitive form bibliomancy involves
standing a book on its spine, letting it fall open, and then picking a
passage with one‚Äôs eyes closed. The passage in question is then taken
to be prophetic. The procedure is hardly random, since books tend
to open wherever they have most frequently been opened in the past,
so some people have suggested using dice or some other chance
mechanism to determine the page. The books that have been used
for this purpose have been the epics of Homer, the Old Testament
among Jews, the Old Testament and New Testament among Chris-
tians, and the Qur‚Äôan in Islam. Somewhat surprisingly Virgil‚Äôs Aeneid
was also used in the late Roman empire and in the Middle Ages. This
may have been partly due to the fact that it was a prestigious verse
epic in Latin paralleling the Iliad and the Odyssey in Greek, but more
likely because Virgil was considered to have predicted the birth of
Jesus Christ in his fourth eclogue (see page 67).
St Augustine (354‚Äì430) in his Confessions (8.12.29) recounts
having heard a voice telling him to ‚Äòpick up and read‚Äô (tolle, lege).
He picked up the Bible, which he had been reading, and it fell
open at Romans 13:13‚Äì14:
So was I speaking and weeping in the most bitter contrition of my
heart, when, lo! I heard from a neighbouring house a voice, as of
boy or girl, I know not, chanting, and oft repeating, ‚ÄòTake up and
read; Take up and read.‚Äô Instantly, my countenance altered, I

began to think most intently whether children were wont in any
kind of play to sing such words: nor could I remember ever to
have heard the like. So checking the torrent of my tears, I arose;
interpreting it to be no other than a command from God to open
the book, and read the Ô¨Årst chapter I should Ô¨Ånd. . . . I seized,
opened, and in silence readthatsection on which my eyes Ô¨Årst fell:
Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wanton-
ness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and make not provision for the Ô¨Çesh, in concupiscence.25
He took the choice to have been divinely inspired and showed it to
his friend Alypius and his mother Monica, who had spent years
urging him to become a practising Christian. From that moment
he and Alypius became committed Christians, Augustine eventu-
ally becoming the bishop of Hippo, Alypius becoming the bishop
of Tagaste, and both of them plus Monica acquiring sainthood. It
is interesting to note that bibliomancy was later condemned, even
by Augustine himself, who presumably did not consider this
example to be in the same class as deliberately seeking guidance
by opening a book at random or as determined by the fall of dice
(Flint 1991: 223; Peters 2002: 196).
Iconicity
A sense of analogy runs through human cultures. It can be seen in
the use of voodoo-type images and in charms and prayers that use
the ‚Äòjust as . . . so also‚Äô formula. Gager (1992: 26) quotes a Hittite
counter-spell that reads, ‚ÄòJust as I have burned these threads and

they will not come back, even so let also these words of the sorcerer
be burned up‚Äô. This sense of parallelism also shows up as an iconic
relation between the performance of a text or ritual procedure and
the intended effect. At a simple level a charm or prayer is thought
to have more chance of success the more it is repeated, hence
thrice-repeated prayers, novenas, decades of the rosary, and lit-
anies. Among Tibetan Buddhists a prayer wheel is used to multiply
prayers. The traditional Tibetan prayer wheel is a small cylinder
mounted on a central shaft and bearing a prayer or mantra on its
surface. Each revolution of the prayer wheel provides a repetition
of the prayer. Besides the hand-held prayer wheel there are prayer
wheels that are turned by wind, Ô¨Çowing water, or the warm air
rising from a candle. Nowadays there are even prayer wheels
operated by electric motors or simulated by computers.
As we saw earlier, the word abracadabra appears in the writing
of Quintus Serenus Sammonicus. He wrote that to recover from a
tertian fever a sick person should wear an amulet around the neck
containing a piece of parchment inscribed with a triangular for-
mula derived from this word, which acts like a funnel to drive the
sickness out of the body (Figure 27). There is meant to be an analogy
between the shrinking of the word and the reduction of the fever.
This use of shrinking words was common in Hellenistic times and
continued in the Roman empire and later in Europe. One shrinking
word used in amulets was the Hebrew word shebr√Ær√Æ, which was
thought to cure diseases of the eye (Figure 28). Remember that
Hebrew is written from right to left and originally vowels were not
written (so there was no symbol for e), but some letters could represent
long vowels, such as j, which represents √Æ. The word shebr√Ær√Æ appeared
in full on the Ô¨Årst line (u ¬º sh, b ¬º b, t ¬º r, and j ¬º √Æ), then br√Ær√Æ, r√Ær√Æ,
162
secret language
√Ær√Æ, r√Æ, and Ô¨Ånally √Æ. These were recited and as the words got shorter
the disease was supposed to diminish (Budge 1978: 220)
Analogous to the shrinking word is the use of a formula contain-
ing a number, usually nine. This formula is repeated with
the number being reduced by one with each repetition. Like the
shrinking word, this was an example of sympathetic magic. The
disease or swelling was supposed to reduce as the series of numbers
in the formula decreased, though it is not clear from the records
what interval was allowed to elapse between repetitions (Jolly
2002: 39). Here is an example aimed at curing a skin disease (tetter)
(Roper 2003a: 20).26

The number nine is common in the magic of the ancient Near East
and later in Europe. Budge (1978: 435) suggests that its signiÔ¨Åcance derives
from the fact that it is three times three. This raises the question of why
three was signiÔ¨Åcant. ‚ÄòThree times‚Äô appears regularly in magic formulas,
perhaps simply because it is a satisfactory number, neither too small nor

If a culture includes means of invoking supernatural assistance
with curses, cures, or divination, it follows that it will provide ways
of countering a curse (and possibly a cure) or averting a prophesied
disaster. Counter-charms and rituals intended to reverse spells
sometimes entail destroying the image of a sorcerer‚Äîgiving him
a piece of his own medicine, so to speak.27
A written curse can be
destroyed and replaced, as is illustrated in Egil‚Äôs Saga. Egil Skalla-

too large. This may be the same reason why narrative jokes tend to have a
tripartite structure with the punchline in the third episode. The fact that
three is a small odd number may be signiÔ¨Åcant in contexts where sym-
metry is not required. An example of the use of multiples of three in the
context of prayer can be seen in the Catholic nine-day prayer, the novena.

The farmer tells Egil that in an attempt to cure her he had the son
of a neighbour carve runes and place them in her bed. Egil Ô¨Ånds
these runes in her bed scratched on a whalebone. He scrapes the
runes off the bone and throws it in the Ô¨Åre. He then replaces them
with his own runes and the young woman recovers (Egil‚Äôs Saga 73).28
Egil recites a verse as follows:
Skalat ma√∞r r√∫nar r√≠sta, None should write runes

Egil assumes that the farmer‚Äôs neighbour was not malicious,
only incompetent. His accidental curse is overcome by physically
destroying the runes and replacing them with efÔ¨Åcacious ones.
In the Graeco-Roman world a wheel device was used in casting
spells. The Greeks called it a rhombus and the Romans a turbo. The
sorcerer pronounced the spell and span the wheel. A long thread
was attached to the wheel and as the wheel span, the thread was
taken up and became wound around the wheel. The more thread
was wound around the wheel, the more the target supposedly fell
under the spell of the sorcerer. In Epode 17 Horace begs Canidia,
portrayed as a sorceress, to stop the spell she is casting over him
and reverse the spinning wheel so that he might be free of her

enchantment (citumque retro solve, solve turbinem).29
There are
other variants of this belief that if a given procedure produces
one effect, reversing the procedure will produce the opposite effect.
The Wayagga of Mount Kilmanjaro think that if someone has
stepped over another person‚Äôs body, they should at once turn back
and leap over the body in the reverse direction, thus undoing the
Ô¨Årst action; if they fail to do so, the stepped-over person will soon
die (Frazer 1911b: 289).30
Another variant is for a procedure carried
out in the reverse direction to turn good to evil.
A belief in an iconic relationship between the direction of action
and its intended effect applies to language. Gager, writing about
the curse tablets of the Mediterranean world during the period of
the Roman empire, notes the practice of scrambling names or
writing them backwards with the intention of producing an analo-
gous effect on the intended victim (Gager 1992: 5, 91):
Special forms of writing include either scrambling the names of
the targets or writing them, and sometimes the full text of the
spell, backwards . . . Such techniques clearly express a symbolic
meaning, . . . that the fate of the targets should turn backward or
be scrambled, just like their written names.
The curse tablets also contain examples of alternate left-to-right
and right-to-left (boustrophedon) writing long after this was the

norm, and of upside-down writing, letters written backwards,
and individual words written backwards. One tablet contains the
statement, ‚ÄòJust as these words are cold and right-to-left [eparis-

(Ogden 1999: 30).
In Jewish folklore there are strong, dumb, human-like creatures
known as golem. Some humans were thought to have the power to
create a golem by shaping a Ô¨Ågure out of clay and using the name
of God to give it life, in particular by writing the name of God on a
piece of paper and placing it in the mouth of the Ô¨Ågure.31
To
reverse the process, one removed the piece of paper. In another
version one shaped the golem from clay and walked around it
reciting a combination of letters from the alphabet and the secret
name of God. To kill the golem, one had to walk around it in the
opposite direction and recite the words of creation backwards. In
yet another version one wrote the letters aleph, mem, tƒÅw (vma) on
the golem to bring it to life and then erased the Ô¨Årst letter a to kill
the golem (Hebrew is written right to left, remember). The letters
vma spell emet ‚Äòtruth‚Äô, but vm spells met ‚Äòdead‚Äô (Winslade 2000:

golem-type Ô¨Ågures known as androids.
Belief in the potency of a reversal of direction was linked to
other beliefs about the favourability or otherwise of particular
directions. As we saw earlier, it was considered propitious to
carry out various ceremonies, journeys, and voyages in the same

direction as the sun. In the northern hemisphere for a person
looking south the sun appears to move from left to right or
clockwise and this was a propitious direction in which to move
around an altar or similar. The opposite direction, i.e. anticlock-
wise or counter-clockwise (wythers √êynes ‚Äòwiddershins‚Äô), was consid-
ered unpropitious or as having the power to bring about a reverse
effect. In one traditional Germanic story a girl chasing a ball
inadvertently walks widdershins around a church and disappears.
She is taken away to the Dark Tower by the King of ElÔ¨Çand and
has to be rescued by her younger brother, Childe Rowland.32
One custom reported in Burchard of Worms (c.950‚Äì1025) is a
procedure for getting rid of an unwanted husband. The wife has to
strip, cover herself in honey, and roll in grain, which is then milled
backwards to produce poisonous bread (Jolly 2002: 18). Milling is
normally done in a clockwise direction, so the procedure involving
milling widdershins. In this case the reversal of direction does not
reverse some previous magic, but aims to bring about an evil result,
namely the death of the husband.
In chapter 79 of Grettir‚Äôs Saga Thorbjorn Angle employs the
services of his foster mother, Thurid (Thurithr), to help him

of a large tree stump found by the sea. She Ô¨Ålls the runes with her

blood, recites a spell, and walks backwards around the stump
against the direction of the sun. The stump Ô¨Çoats away against
the tide to Drangey Island where it is brought to Grettir, who tries
to chop it only to Ô¨Ånd that the axe glances off and cuts his thigh.
Eventually the curse enables Thorbjorn to kill Grettir. In this
instance Thurid walks around the stump backwards and against
the direction of the sun to intensify the evil, just as Shakespeare‚Äôs
witches in Macbeth pile up supposed evil elements to make their
brew more potent.
Over the centuries in Christian communities there have from
time to time been those who conducted or attended black masses.33
These are versions of the mass dedicated to Satan and they involve a
principle of opposites. The cruciÔ¨Åx is inverted, the candles are black
instead of white, and some ‚Äòsinful‚Äô actions are included. In some
versions a naked woman serves as the altar and the ceremony ends
with intercourse. SigniÔ¨Åcantly as far as language is concerned, the
text of the mass, or at least part of it, is said to be recited in reverse.
There are also other reversals such as substituting Satan for God and
switching negatives and afÔ¨Årmatives so that part of the Lord‚Äôs prayer
would be read as, ‚ÄòLead us into temptation and deliver us not from
evil‚Äô (Cavendish 1967: 335).
33
Reports on witches‚Äô sabbaths (sabbats), black masses, and the like are
not always accurate. Early testimony speaks of witches Ô¨Çying on broom-
sticks, sacriÔ¨Åcial infanticide, and the presence of Satan. There are con-
temporary black masses (Moody 1993), but most modern witchcraft is a
mixture of sorcery and animism involving fertility rites and healing magic.
It is deliberately pagan in orientation and rejects Christianity and satanism
(Russell 1993).

words of power
Another notion involving opposites is the idea that the true
name of the devil is the true name of God spelt backwards. One
version is Havayoth, which has been adopted as the name of a
gothic metal band formed in Sweden. They have an album entitled
His Creation Reversed and in one number we hear, ‚ÄòI am . . .
damned to earth, I will lead the world astray‚Äô. Rock groups often
adopt names associated with something ‚Äòbad‚Äô, whether it be
wicked or merely naughty.
One curious example of reversing the effect of a claim on the
supernatural was to say a mass for the dead naming a living person
in the hope that this would bring about that person‚Äôs death. The
practice was condemned at the 694 Council of Toledo, but was still
practised as late as the sixteenth century (Cavendish 1967: 327).

WORDS TO AVOID
There is a superstition in avoiding superstition.
FRANCIS BACON (1561‚Äì1626)
T
he previous chapter dealt with using words and formulas
that were deemed powerful. This chapter deals with
avoiding such words. Some form of avoidance involving
language is universal. It may concern certain words, phrases, or
topics, or it may be a matter of refraining from speech altogether in
some contexts. Linguistic self-censorship often arises out of re-
spect. If we Ô¨Ånd ourselves chatting with the queen, we are not
likely to refer to the mouth as the cake-hole or the eyes as the mince
pies since these are slang terms with informal or lower-class asso-
ciations. Failure to avoid inappropriate terms in a conversation
with the queen would probably not have serious consequences, but
in many societies taboos on unsuitable behaviour are stronger and
a plea of ignorance or accidental transgression is no excuse. In
extreme cases an autocratic ruler might impose the death penalty
171
on someone who showed disrespect. Equally, most societies are
fearful of provoking the wroth of deities or spirits through imper-
tinent or proscribed language.
Usually the grounds for classifying language as disrespectful
have to do with register, association, or connotation, as with the
examples of cake-hole and mince pies above, but taboos on the use
of names sometimes have a different basis. In traditional societies
there is widespread belief in a natural connection between a word
and its referent, and a name is considered part of one‚Äôs being. In
the following pages a number of name taboos are illustrated. While
some are motivated by respect, the more interesting ones stem
from the belief that the name is part of a person.
Names of Humans
Taboos on using personal names are reported in a wide variety of
cultures. The details vary from language to language, but it is
common for people to be reluctant to reveal their own real names.
In many small-scale societies names are not much used. Instead,
people are often addressed or referred to by kin terms such as ‚Äòson‚Äô or
‚Äòfather‚Äôs sister‚Äô. In some societies people have two names, a ‚Äòreal‚Äô
name, which they keep secret, and an extra name or nickname which
is disclosed to outsiders. In other societies people will turn to a third
party to announce their name when someone asks, because there is a
taboo on uttering one‚Äôs own name (Frazer 1911b: 244‚Äì6). Among the
Andaman Islanders people avoid the name of a baby before and after
birth, of an initiand into adulthood, of a bride or bridegroom around
the time of the wedding, and of a dead person for the period of
172
secret language
mourning, i.e. at all stages of the life course involving important
changes of status (Radcliffe-Brown 1965: 79‚Äì80). In many cultures
people refrain from mentioning their real name for fear that malevo-
lent spirits will harm them or someone will use their name in sorcery.
Australian Aborigines commonly regarded names as equally integral
to their identities as body parts, and therefore capable of being used
in sorcery. Curr (1886, vol. 1: 46) reports that in some tribes men gave
up their name at initiation into manhood to prevent it being
exploited in this way.
In some languages there is grammatical evidence that a name is
treated like a part of the body.1
In Acholi (Western Nilotic,
Uganda), for instance, possession is indicated by the particle pa
(Bavin 1996: 845‚Äì7):
(a) bongo pa latin
clothes of child
‚Äòthe child‚Äôs clothes‚Äô
This particle is not used for parts of wholes, where the relationship
is shown simply by juxtaposition, as in (b). The relationship of a
name to the ‚Äòowner‚Äô of a name is shown in the same way (c):
(b) jang yat
branch tree
‚Äòbranch of a tree‚Äô
(c) nying latin
name child
‚Äòchild‚Äôs name‚Äô

In many Australian languages names are treated like body parts and
other parts of wholes. Florey (2005: 67) mentions that some Central
Moluccan languages do the same.

The notion that knowledge of someone‚Äôs name gives you power
over that person is a recurrent one in folklore. Consider the
following myth of the Ancient Egyptians:
The Sun God, Ra, becomes old and begins to dribble. The
goddess Isis, who was the daughter of Geb, god of the earth,
and Nut, the goddess of the sky, mixes some of Ra‚Äôs spittle with
dirt and creates a snake, which she leaves in Ra‚Äôs path. Ra is
bitten and although he is all-powerful, he cannot cure himself
since the snake has been made from his own spittle. Isis offers to
cure him, but she claims the cure will work only if Ra reveals to
her his true name. Ra tells her his name and Isis cures him, but
he cannot recover his power, and from then on Isis is the more
powerful.2
There are a number of interesting aspects of this myth. First of all,
although Ra is all-powerful, he cannot cure himself because he has
been bitten by a snake made from a substance from his own body.3
Secondly, the secret to his power is his real name. The parallelism
between a body part or bodily efÔ¨Çuvia on the one hand and a name
on the other is clear: both have power over the person.
Moving from myth to history we Ô¨Ånd further evidence of a
belief among the Egyptians that a person can be harmed through
mistreatment of their name:

The story can be found in numerous sources, including Frazer
1911b: 387‚Äì9.

Omnipotence is a barrier to drama, so heroes tend to have their weak

Superman loses his power in the presence of kryptonite.

An example of the coalescence of a symbol and the thing it
stands for is the treating of a person‚Äôs name as an essential part
of him‚Äîas it were, in a way, identical with him. We have a
number of pottery bowls which Egyptian kings of the Middle
Kingdom had inscribed with the names of hostile tribes in
Palestine, Libya and Nubia; the names of their rulers; and the
names of certain rebellious Egyptians. These bowls were sol-
emnly smashed at a ritual, possibly at the funeral of the king‚Äôs
predecessor; and the object of this ritual was explicitly stated. It
was that all these enemies, obviously out of the pharoah‚Äôs reach,
should die. But if we call the ritual act of the breaking of the
bowls symbolical, we miss the point. The Egyptians felt that
real harm was done to their enemies by the destruction of their
names. (Frankfort et al. 1949: 21‚Äì2)
For the Ancient Egyptians entry into paradise was a trial involving
a long succession of naming. They believed that in order to attain
life in the world beyond the grave one had to know the names of
the gods, the entry gates, and the gatekeepers and attendants. The
last part of the journey was by boat and required knowledge of the
names of the parts of the boat, the rivers, and the river banks
(Budge 1899: 157‚Äì81).
Among the Ancient Egyptians and later among the Arabs of
North Africa there was a belief that being able to name spirits gave
one power over them (Budge 1899: 157; Frazer 1911b: 389f.). Gods
or jinns who revealed their name had to submit to the will of the
one who knew it. The importance of this knowledge for the
efÔ¨Åcacy of a charm or curse is clear in the following inscription
on an amulet of uncertain date, but probably from early in the
Christian era, found in Mesopotamia. The text refers to a lilith‚Äîa
sexually voracious female demon. By the second century ad a
belief arose that these unwelcome succubae could be separated
175

There is also a
reference to Rabbi Yehoshua bar Perahya, who lived in the Ô¨Årst
century bc and was revered as a magus (Gager 1992: 229‚Äì31).
By your name I make this amulet . . . I overcome all demons . . .
whether I know their names or do not know them. And in case
I do not know the names, they were already explained to me at
the seven days of creation. What was not revealed to me at the
seven days of creation was disclosed to me in the deed of divorce
that came to me here from across the sea, written and sent to
Rabbi Yehoshua bar Perahya. Just as there was a lilith who
strangled human beings‚Äîand Rabbi Yehoshua bar Perahya
sent a ban against her, though she did not accept it because
he did not know her name‚Äîher name was written in the deed
of divorce and a proclamation was made against her in heaven,
so you [the demons] are . . . overcome under the feet of Mar-
naqa son of Qala [the client].
Although the author of this text shows he [sic] believes in the
importance of knowing the names of the spirits that he wishes to
bind, it seems he does not in fact know them. Another curse from
the same period addresses a spirit by name and then adds ‚Äòor if you
wish to be addressed by any other name‚Äô, apparently in an attempt
to hedge its bets (Ogden 1999: 45).
The power of naming is a common theme of European folklore.
In one set of stories a young woman has a problem, which is solved
by a gnome with magical powers. In return the gnome demands the
woman‚Äôs Ô¨Årstborn child unless she can guess his name. She manages
to Ô¨Ånd it out so he is unable to claim the baby and disappears. One of

The short story ‚ÄòLil√≠t‚Äô by Primo Levi features a creation myth about
the origin of Lilith.
176
secret language
the better-known examples is the story of Rumpelstiltskin (German
Rumpelstiltzchen), originally published in the folk tales collected by
the brothers Grimm (Grimm [1812] 2002).
In Rumpelstiltskin a man boasts that his daughter can spin straw
into gold. On hearing this the king locks her in a tower with
straw and a spinning wheel and commands her to produce gold
or she will be killed. She is saved by the appearance of a dwarf
with the power to spin the straw into gold, but in return he
demands her Ô¨Årst-born child. Impressed with the young
woman‚Äôs ability the king marries her, but when her Ô¨Årst child
is born, the dwarf returns to claim the baby. However, he agrees
to give up his claim if the queen can guess his name. This seems
an impossible task, but the queen‚Äôs servant goes off and spies on
the dwarf and overhears him reciting a verse which ends with
‚ÄòRumpelstiltskin is my name‚Äô. When the dwarf returns, the
queen is able to tell him his name and the gnome is powerless
to enforce his claim.
This story exists in dozens of versions and the gnome appears with
various names. In Britain the name is Tom Tit Tot, Terrytip, Trit-
a-Trot, and Whuppity Stoorie, in Sweden it is Tittel Ture, in
Hungary Winterkobl, and in Norway Skaane. In an early French
version published in 1696 the gnome is Ricdin-Ricdon and there is
an interesting variation. Ricdin-Ricdon actually reveals his name to
the young woman, but she forgets it. As a result of the gnome‚Äôs
help in spinning, she Ô¨Ånds favour at court and is taught to read,
and she tries writing letters in an effort to recall the name, which is
forever on the tip of her tongue, elusively out of reach. In the end
the prince tells her what it is.5

to be determined by combat between Telramund and anyone
who will champion Elsa. A knight appears in a boat drawn by a
swan. He agrees to Ô¨Åght for Elsa and be her protector providing
she never asks him his name. The knight defeats Telramund
and marries Elsa, but Telramund‚Äôs wife, Ortrud, sows doubt in
Elsa‚Äôs mind about the knight‚Äôs origin and induces her to ask his
name. Elsa asks the question and he is compelled to answer.
Before the assembled court he reveals that he is Lohengrin, the
son of Parsifal, a knight of the Holy Grail. However, since his
name has been revealed, he must return to the Holy Grail.
In the Bible there are a number of references to names being
kept secret. In Genesis 32:29, when Jacob asks the angel who has
wrestled with him during the night what his name is, the angel
only replies, ‚ÄòWherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?‚Äô
In the Book of Judges an angel appears to Manoah and his wife to
tell them they are to have a son (who will be the hero Samson)
and when Manoah asks the angel his name, the angel replies,
‚ÄòWhy asketh thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?‚Äô (Judges
13:18). In Revelation 19:11‚Äì12 it is said of the rider of the white
horse, ‚ÄòHis eyes were as a Ô¨Çame of Ô¨Åre, and on his head were
many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but
he himself‚Äô.
Among the curse tablets described in the previous chapter are
some which explicitly state that the target‚Äôs name has been delib-
erately damaged as in an attempt to harm him. One has a nail hole
pierced through the name and bears the words, ‚ÄòI nail his name,
178

that is, himself‚Äô (Cavendish 1967: 43).6
In others the name of the
intended victim is written in reverse or jumbled. The purpose is
not concealment, because in some such cases the name appears
elsewhere in the text of the curse in normal form. It seems
distortion of the name is intended to have an analogous ill effect
on the victim. This is conÔ¨Årmed by one tablet which asks that the
target‚Äôs words and deeds be jumbled as his name has been jumbled
(Ogden 1999: 299‚Äì30).
Names were also used to identify images that were subjected to
magic. A form of love magic practised in Europe in the Middle
Ages involved writing the names of various demons on the image
of an unresponsive beloved. This was supposed to result in the
demons tormenting the beloved until he or she submitted. ‚ÄòThe
demons symbolically represented on the image are to be really
present in the woman‚Äô (Kieckhefer 1989: 162). If a magician
wanted to gain favour with a person in authority, he would
make an image of himself and an image of the dignitary and
write names on the images to identify them. The images were
bound together, with the image of the dignitary bowing before
that of the magician.
Among the Manambu of New Guinea all personal names are
the names of totemic ancestral beings and each sub-clan jealously
guards its stock of ancestral names. If a neighbouring sub-clan
attempts to use one of them, a dispute ensues. People are unwilling
to have their name written down since it could then be taken away,
along with the life force of its owner (Harrison 1990: 60).

The same belief is reported from the Tolampoo of Sulawesi
(Celebes) (Frazer 1911b: 319).
Among the Cherokees when prayers for the sick had no apparent
effect, the patient was given a new name (Frazer 1911b: 318‚Äì19).
Among the Jews the name of a dangerously ill person was often
changed. The new name was the Ô¨Årst one on a page of the Bible
opened at random.7
The underlying principle in changing the name of one who is ill
is the assumption that the former name, under which the divine
decree [causing the illness] was issued, becomes non-existent,
and that, when a new name is given him, he becomes another
person, in regard to whom the decree has no force. In a later
period the original name was retained and another added to it,
usually one signifying the recovery of the patient. The most
popular additional names were Hayyim (life), Shalom (peace),
Raphael (God heals), Azriel (God helps), or some other name,
selected from the Bible.8
The names of evildoers were avoided, since these were regarded as
curses. This can be seen, for instance, in Isaiah‚Äôs prophecy that the
names of the wicked shall be a curse and that the chosen will be
given a new name to avoid the curse (Isaiah 65: 15).
A widespread taboo concerns the name of a dead person. This
may be based on a fear of offending the spirit of the dead person or
a fear that the spirit will remain in the locality and be malevolent,
though respect may play a part too. In Ponape (now Pohnpei, one

of the Federated States of Micronesia) a man called Puik died. His
name was also the word for pig, so pigs were referred to for some
time as ‚Äòthe animal that digs‚Äô (Frazer 1911b: 362). Among the
Australian Aborigines there is a taboo on using the name of a
recently deceased person (Berndt 1964: 389). He or she is said to
be ‚Äòno name‚Äô. Among the people of the Warrnambool language
group of southeastern Australia a dead person was referred to during
a period of mourning as muruka ‚Äòdead person‚Äô. If their name was
one that was also a common noun, then the common noun was
replaced; so, for example, if a man called wilan ‚Äòblack cockatoo‚Äô
died, the black cockatoo was temporarily renamed waang ‚Äòcrow‚Äô.
The names of near relatives of the deceased were avoided during
mourning. If a man‚Äôs father died, the man was called parapitj ‚Äòmale
orphan‚Äô and if a woman‚Äôs father died, the woman was called
parapiya ‚Äòfemale orphan‚Äô (Dawson 1881: 42). Among the Manambu
of New Guinea a bereaved person is given a new name to ward off
the spirit of the person whose death they are mourning (Harrison
1990: 61). In some parts of the world anyone with the same name as
the deceased takes on a new name, but among the Masai (east
Africa) the deceased is given a new name, which can be freely used
(Frazer 1911b: 354).
As we saw above, in the ancient Near East those seeking to enlist
the power of supernatural beings sought to Ô¨Ånd out their names,
but it is also true that names of deities were often treated with
respect and subject to avoidance. Among the Jews yhwh (efej),
the name of God, was avoided. Although there was no rule in the
Torah prohibiting its use, such was the respect with which it was
treated that the practice arose of not uttering it at all and eventually
it was spoken only by the high priest in the Holy of Holies on Yom

At the beginning of Chapter 5 I mentioned that vowels
were not written in the original Hebrew of the Bible. The vowels
were introduced in the form of subscript pointing by the Masor-
etes (‚Äòbearers of tradition‚Äô) around the seventh century ad, by
which time the pronunciation of the vowels of the name of God
had been lost.10
The name yhwh was given the vowels of Adonai
‚ÄòMy Lord‚Äô, one of the other names used for God. The name yhwh
was often written in abbreviated form as yh or yhw. In Hebrew
the letters of the alphabet also serve as numerals (as is illustrated in
Figure 23 above) and 15 and 16 would normally be yh and yw
respectively, but since these combinations are fragments of yhwh,
they are avoided by using (fi) T
: W (9 √æ 6) and (gi) T
: Z (9 √æ 7).
Avoidance of writing God‚Äôs name led to writing the name as two
yods (jj), generally with a stroke between them, or as dƒÅleth (t),
the Ô¨Årst consonant of Adonai. yhwh was also referred to as Ha-
Shem ‚Äòthe Name‚Äô. Other names for God appear in the Bible,
including Elohim (actually a plural form), which is the name
generally used in Genesis, and El Shaddai ‚ÄòGod Almighty‚Äô. All
these names are treated with respect and some Jews today refrain
from writing God, but instead write G-d or G‚Äôd.11
Christians use the names God and Jesus Christ freely in serious
contexts. Such names are also used profanely by Christians and
others and in such contexts there are deformations in various
languages that smack of avoidance. In English euphemistic

deformations of God abound, such as gad, egad, gosh, golly, and by
Godfrey. The last, which has the preposition by, gives a clue to the
origin of a lot of this profanity. Traditionally in making a formal
oath one called God as witness or staked something precious. So
one might say, ‚ÄòI swear by God that what I say is true‚Äô or ‚ÄòI swear
on my mother‚Äôs life what I say is true‚Äô. The implied penalty for
untruthfulness was divine retribution directed at oneself or one‚Äôs
mother. Similar formulae in informal contexts are intended to
emphasize one‚Äôs sincerity and may be reduced to by God or
deformed to by golly, etc. Euphemistic variants of Jesus include
Jeez, Jiminy, Gee wiz, and Jeepers. For Christ there is Crikey and
Cripes, and for Jesus Christ there is Jiminy Cricket(s), Jeepers
Creepers, and Judas Priest.12
For Lord there is Law, (Oh) Lor, and
Lawdy. In general Jesus is not used as a given name, but it is so used
in Spanish.
Over the centuries there has been a taboo on using the name of
the devil or Satan, since he was considered just as real as God and a
powerful, malevolent spirit whom it was best not to antagonize. In
English we have an expression, ‚ÄòSpeak of the devil and he‚Äôll
appear‚Äô. Originally this was a warning not to say Satan or the
devil for fear of provoking an apparition or unwelcome attention.
Nowadays the expression is used lightly, usually in the shortened
form ‚ÄòSpeak of the devil‚Äô, by people conversing about a third party
when that third party appears within sight or earshot. Nicknames
for the devil have proliferated, presumably to avoid using
the real name. Some of the better-known euphemisms are the

Arch-Fiend, the Evil One, the Prince of Darkness, His Sable Majesty,
the Old Enemy (French le mauvais ennemi), and Old Nick. There is
also The Deuce! and What the Deuce!, but these are presumably no
longer thought of as terms for the devil.
It is not uncommon for there to be a taboo on using the name of
a monarch or highly respected person. Frazer (1911b: 376‚Äì7) re-
ports that this is true among the Zulus. Names may be common
nouns, and a common noun used as the name of a chief is subject
to the taboo. One Dwandwe chief was called Langa, which was the
word for ‚Äòsun‚Äô, so the Dwandwe substituted the word gala for the
sun. In China there was a taboo on pronouncing the name of the
emperor or any word homophonous with the emperor‚Äôs name.
The taboo extended to the characters used to write the emperor‚Äôs
name. This was problematic where the emperor‚Äôs name contained
common characters and Emperor Xuan of the Han dynasty, whose
given name Bingyi contained two very common characters,
changed his name to Xun, which was written with a far less
common character, to make it easier for his people to avoid
using his name. One could avoid writing characters used in the
emperor‚Äôs name by substituting a synonymous character or omit-
ting a stroke, usually the Ô¨Ånal stroke. In 1777 Wang Xihou wrote
the name of Emperor Qianlong in his dictionary without leaving
out any stroke. He and his family were executed and their property
conÔ¨Åscated.13

See the Wikipedia entry on the naming taboo. During the time I was

a royal pardon.

In-Laws
In many parts of the world there are strict rules governing conduct
towards in-laws.14
They may involve avoidance of any contact or
direct communication; the use of a special vocabulary in speaking
to an in-law or in the presence of an in-law; or not mentioning the
name of an in-law. The purpose of such codes may be to minimize
any conÔ¨Çict between loyalty to relations by marriage and loyalty to
kin, but they are often treated as having been laid down by
venerated ancestors or supernatural beings, and they are not trea-
ted lightly. Among the Dusun of Borneo it is considered bad luck
to utter the name of a mother-in-law or father-in-law (Williams
1963b: 173, riddle 170), and Australian Aborigines are affected by a
deep sense of shame or disgust if there is even an accidental
transgression of a taboo relating to in-laws. There is a report of a
man becoming very distressed because his mother-in-law‚Äôs shadow
had fallen on him (Fison in Fison and Howitt 1880: 103). The
shadow is often regarded as part of a person akin to a body part and
treated like a body part grammatically.15
Among speakers of Kambaata, an East Cushitic language spoken
in Ethiopia, women traditionally practised a form of respect towards
their mother-in-law, father-in-law, and in some cases the parents of
14
We do not have any such taboo, but the mother-in-law remains the
butt of male jokes. The French for father-in-law is beau-p√®re ‚ÄòÔ¨Åne/beau-
tiful father‚Äô, for mother-in-law belle m√®re ‚ÄòÔ¨Åne/beautiful mother‚Äô, and so
on with other in-laws. These terms appear to be euphemistic.

In the New Testament it is claimed that even the shadow of Peter
falling on a sick person could effect a cure (Acts 5:15‚Äì16).

the father-in-law. This respect behaviour was called ballishsh√°ta and
it involved some avoidance of social contact, mainly with the father-
in-law, and avoiding the names of the parents-in-law and any word
beginning with the same syllable as their names (Treis 2005). On
her wedding day the bride was given a laxative to void her stomach
and bowels, and was then taught a small vocabulary of ballishsh√°ta
words, receiving a sip of drink or a morsel of food with each word
learnt. She was also taught how to Ô¨Ånd substitute words to avoid
using words with the tabooed initial syllables. These words could be
found using the following principles. In each example the everyday
word is given Ô¨Årst and the ballishsh√°ta word to the right.
(a) a word that is semantically similar
af√≥o mouth yabur√∫ lips
(b) derivation, e.g. using -aanch√∫, which is like the -er in
English forming agent nouns
harruuchch√∫ donkey iyy-aanch√∫ one who carries
(c) a periphrasis
hiz√≥o brother ama‚Äô√≠beet√∫ son of my mother
(d) using an antonym
usur- tie gaffar- untie
uurr stand up afuu‚Äôll sit down
As a last resort a woman can use the root soomm-, which means
‚Äòunspeakable‚Äô. Some women applied the restrictions to function
words, though others applied them to lexical words only.
Among the Southern Bantu peoples such as the Zulu and Xhosa
married women traditionally had to practise hlonipa, avoidance
behaviour in relation to male in-laws, especially the father-in-law,
and sometimes to the mother-in-law. With respect to language it
involved avoiding the in-law‚Äôs name, and what is remarkable,
186
secret language
avoiding any syllable contained in the name (Herbert 1990a, b).
For instance, a certain Xhosa woman with senior male in-laws
called Dike, Ntlokwana, and Saki and a mother-in-law called Nina
could not utter the syllables di, ke, ntlo, kwa, na, sa, ki, ni, and na.
In order to comply with this restriction a woman could substitute a
different consonant:
unina utsitsa your mother
idikazi ishikazi unmarried woman
It is well known that Bantu languages have noun classes, each of
which is marked by a preÔ¨Åx. One strategy for avoiding a potentially
offending syllable is to move a word from one noun class to
another. For instance, the word sana ‚Äòbaby‚Äô is in class 11, for
which the class preÔ¨Åx is u-, yielding usana, but in class 9 the preÔ¨Åx
is in-. When this preÔ¨Åx is put in front of a root beginning with s, it
induces an affricated stop ts
, so that sana becomes ints
ana. In this
way the syllable sa can be avoided.
Another strategy is to simply to drop a consonant:
umlenze um‚Äôenze leg
-hleke ‚Äôeke laugh
All these strategies for avoiding a particular syllable involve con-
sonants, never vowels. Herbert notes that the substituted conson-
ants are often clicks.16
Since clicks were a distinctive feature of the
16
Clicks are used in English, but not as parts of words. The tsk tsk
sound used to express disapproval is a type of click. The back of the tongue
is pressed against the soft palate and the tip of the tongue is pressed against
the teeth. As the middle of the tongue is lowered, a low pressure pocket is
formed and as the tip of the tongue is moved from the teeth, the inrushing

Khoisan languages, Herbert suggests that these languages provided
a pool of consonants not found in Bantu languages and therefore a
sure-Ô¨Åre means of avoiding the taboo syllables. Clicks have now
spread to Southern Bantu languages in general, and Herbert
suggests that the practice of using Khoisan words to provide safe
consonants may be responsible for this. Herbert‚Äôs explanation is
highly plausible, since borrowing from Khoisan languages into
Bantu consists almost entirely of consonants. Each married
woman would have had different in-laws and therefore different
syllables to avoid, but since the number of syllable onsets in
traditional Bantu languages is not high, many onsets would have
been taboo for a large majority of women. Some women must have
adopted ready-made hlonipa forms so that they became regular for
women and then for the speech community at large.
Hlonipa does not involve just phonological means of avoiding
taboo syllables. There were lexical strategies that included using
archaic words or borrowed words such as ukupaya from English
‚Äòpay‚Äô. There was also substitution of semantically similar words:
intasa brushwood iinkuni Ô¨Årewood
iswekile sugar intlabathi sand
ninzi many inkitha great number
Among the Kalapalo of Central Brazil, and more widely in the
area, there is mutual respect between in-laws involving avoidance
of eye contact, of working together in close proximity, and of
air produces a click. Another type of click is used to express encourage-
ment (usually accompanied by a thumbs-up sign), and yet another to tell
horses to ‚Äògiddy-up‚Äô.

walking in front of a mother-in-law or father-in-law. Communi-
cation with an in-law is indirect, through an intermediary. Kinship
terms or other indirect expressions are substituted for the names
of one‚Äôs in-laws. For instance, one man referred to an in-law
named TaÔ¨Åtse ‚ÄòMacaw‚Äô as ‚Äòthe one with the blue tail feathers‚Äô
(Basso 2007: 171).
Among the Australian Aborigines there is a widespread taboo on
having any dealings with in-laws. The taboo is stronger for men
and is strongest between a man and his mother-in-law or potential
mothers-in-law. The system of kinship is classiÔ¨Åcatory, so that a
man can have a mother-in-law (the mother of his wife) and other
women such as the sister of his mother-in-law who are also
mothers-in-law (Berndt 1964: 82, 132). Dawson (1881: 29), writing
about the people of the Warrnambool area in Victoria, notes,
‚Äòshould he meet them [mothers-in-law] on a path, they immedi-
ately leave it, clap their hands, cover up their heads with their rugs,
walk in a stooping position and speak in whispers till he has gone
past‚Äô. In some areas a man and his mother-in-law may not have
direct dealings. If something such as food is to be conveyed from
one to the other it must be passed via a third person or left on the
ground for the other party to pick up (see, for instance, Meggitt
1962: 153 on the Warlpiri). Among the Kamilaroi of New South
Wales a man and his mother-in-law can only converse by facing
away from one another and shouting as if they were some distance
apart. Among the Kurnai of Gippsland no direct speech is allowed
and any verbal exchange must be through a third person (Fison
and Howitt 1880: 103, 203).
Among the Guugu-Yimidhirr of northeast Queensland a man
must not speak to his mother-in-law and he must use a special
189
words to avoid
respect register to speak to his brothers-in-law or father-in-law. In
the following example the everyday version is given in the Ô¨Årst line
and the in-law version in the second (Haviland 1979a: 368, see also
1979b).
Ngayu mayi buda-nhu.
Ngayu gudhubay bambanga-nhu
I food eat-purposive

Respect forms of language are common in Australia. They are
often referred to as ‚Äòmother-in-law languages‚Äô since they were
mostly used when a mother-in-law was within earshot. These
respect forms of language have the same phonology, morphology,
and syntax as the everyday language, but a separate lexicon. Note
in the example above that the pronoun ngayu ‚ÄòI‚Äô and the purposive
inÔ¨Çection -nhu are retained in the in-law version. The vocabulary
of mother-in-law languages is much smaller than that of the
everyday language and a word in the mother-in-law language will
often correspond with a number of words in the everyday lan-
guage. For instance, where there would be different words for
different kinds of spear or boomerang in the everyday language,
there would be only one general term in the mother-in-law lan-
guage. In Dyirbal the mother-in-law language has equivalents for
all the words in the everyday lexicon (Dixon 1972: 32‚Äì4), but in
other languages such as Bunuba not all the words in the everyday
language have a mother-in-law equivalent and some everyday
words have to be used (Rumsey 1982).
The vocabulary of these respect forms of language often con-
tains words from the everyday vocabulary of other dialects or
190
secret language
languages, a phenomenon which is reminiscent of our euphemistic
use of French words such as derri√®re.
Among the Gurindji vagueness is common in the respect lan-
guage, as is avoidance of imperatives and even of the second person
pronoun. The apologetic interjection wartirri ‚Äòsorry!‚Äô is also fre-
quent. All these characteristics are illustrated in the following
example, where (a) is the everyday version and (b) the respect
(pirntika) version (McConvell 1982: 96).
(a) Yanta kayirra.
go north
‚ÄòGo north!‚Äô
(b) Wartirri nganta-lu luwa-wu kuya-partak.
sorry perhaps-they do-future thus-way
‚ÄòOh dear! perhaps they will do that way (pointing north)‚Äô
The verb luwa normally means ‚Äòto hit with a missile‚Äô, but in the
respect language it is a generic verb standing in for all verbs, rather
like English ‚Äòdo‚Äô, and is glossed as do.
Other Avoidance
Taboos on the names of creatures are very widespread, particularly
predators and dangerous animals. In the cooler regions of the north-
ern hemisphere the inherited names of the bear, the wolf, and the
fox, which are threats to humans, livestock, or domesticated animals,
are often avoided. The bear is often referred to by such terms as
‚Äòuncle‚Äô, ‚Äògrandfather‚Äô, or ‚Äòold man‚Äô, and it is commonplace to note
that the Indo-European root for ‚Äòbear‚Äô, which is reÔ¨Çected in Sanskrit
rk≈°ah, Greek arktos, and Latin ursus (hence Italian orso, French ours,
191
words to avoid
etc.), has been replaced in a number of languages by terms having
what Ullmann (1957: 184) calls ‚Äòan unmistakably euphemistic and
propitiatory ring‚Äô such as Lithuanian lokys ‚Äòlicker‚Äô, Russian medv√©d
‚Äòhoney-eater‚Äô, and Middle Welsh melfochyn ‚Äòhoney-pig‚Äô. English
‚Äòbear‚Äô originally meant ‚Äòbrown‚Äô. The wolf is referred to by descriptive
phrases such as ‚Äògrey legs‚Äô or ‚Äòthe silent one‚Äô and the fox is ‚Äòthe long
tail‚Äô or ‚Äòthe one that goes in the forest‚Äô (Frazer 1911b: 396‚Äì8).
Another animal regarded as an enemy in Europe is the weasel, a
small carnivorous mammal of the Mustela genus, which includes
stoats, some species of mink, polecats, and ferrets. The weasel preyed
on domesticated birds like barnyard fowl and small animals such as
rabbits and, as with the fox, acquired a reputation for villainous
cunning. In Kenneth Grahame‚Äôs The Wind in the Willows the weasels
are the villains and weasel words are misleading words. Across Europe
the weasel bears a number of euphemistic names, mostly on the
theme of ‚Äòyoung woman‚Äô: Danish kj√∂nne ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô and bruden
‚Äòbride‚Äô, French belette ‚Äòlittle pretty one‚Äô, Humgarian meny√©t ‚Äònice little
girl‚Äô, Italian donnola ‚Äòlittle lady‚Äô, Portuguese doninha ‚Äòlittle lady‚Äô, and
Rumanian nevasta ‚Äòbride‚Äô (Ullmann 1957: 190; Gu√©rios 1956: 152‚Äì5).
In the following Old English charm designed to woo bees to
take up residence in some desired location the bees are addressed
by a euphemistic kenning, sigewif ‚Äòvictory woman/women‚Äô.
According to Flom the charm would have been thought ineffective
if the normal word had been used (Flom 1930: 340).

The names for snakes are often subject to taboo, as are the
names of the larger members of the cat family. In Africa the lion is
referred to by such titles as ‚Äòthe owner of the land‚Äô or ‚Äòthe great
beast‚Äô (reminiscent of our ‚Äòlord of the jungle‚Äô). In India the tiger is
referred to as a dog or jackal, and in Southeast Asia as ‚Äòthe
grandfather‚Äô or ‚Äòthe grandfather of the forest‚Äô (Frazer 1911b: 400‚Äì4).
The tiger‚Äôs name is avoided altogether by anyone venturing into its
habitat.
Naming taboos may apply to plants and even minerals. In
Malaysia and Indonesia it is common for those who go into the
forest to collect camphor to use special vocabulary known as
bahasa kapur ‚Äòcamphor language‚Äô in place of their everyday lan-
guage, because camphor has a spirit which must not be disturbed.
In many parts of the world the name of something that is hunted
or gathered is taboo for the duration of the quest.
Among the Kharwars of southern India the names of animals
such as the pig, jackal, and monkey are taboo only in the morning.
In parts of Germany there was a taboo on the name of the wolf for
the twelve days of Christmas. In Scotland a number of alternative
words had to be used at sea, so a sgian ‚Äòknife‚Äô became a ghiar ‚Äòthe
sharp one‚Äô and sionnach ‚Äòfox‚Äô became madadh ruadh ‚Äòthe red dog‚Äô.
Some taboos apply only among women. Tariana women were
not allowed to see piri, a sacred Ô¨Çute, and words similar to piri were
replaced in their presence. Some place names that contained piri
193

had two forms, one containing piri and a second version that
women could use (Aikhenvald 2003: 619).
There are also taboos on certain numbers in those cultures that
have numbers. We have a remnant of this with 13, which is
considered an unlucky number by some, and many hotels and
other public buildings do not use 13 in numbering Ô¨Çoors and
rooms. In Chinese culture the number 4 is sometimes considered

‚Äòdeath‚Äô (Mandarin example). In the ancient world of the Near East
and Mediterranean any deÔ¨Ånite number was a problem in that it
gave scope for sorcery. In the poem Vivamus, mea Lesbia (v) the
Roman poet Catullus asks his lover to give him a thousand kisses,
then a hundred, then another thousand, and so on. He concludes
with, ‚ÄòWe will lose count of the number, so that we do not know
what it is, lest an evil person will be able to cast a spell knowing
what the number of our kisses is.‚Äô In another poem, Quaeris quot
(vii), he says he will be satisÔ¨Åed when their kisses are as numerous
as the stars or the grains of sand in the Libyan desert, so that the
inquisitive cannot count them nor evil tongue bewitch.
The survey of avoidance in this chapter is by no means exhaust-
ive. Many cultures manifest avoidance in connection with sex and
bodily functions, and there is a wide range of other types which we
do not have space to cover here. Some further examples are given
under the heading of euphemism in Chapter 9.

JARGON, SLANG, ARGOT,
AND ‚ÄòSECRET LANGUAGES‚Äô
The one stream of poetry which is continually Ô¨Çowing
is slang. Every day a nameless poet weaves some fairy
tracery of popular language.
G.K. CHESTERTON, THE DEFENDANT,
CHAPTER 13: A DEFENCE OF SLANG
I
n a small-scale society it is usually pretty much true that all
speakers have a complete vocabulary of their language. There
may be some specialized, secret, ritual language, but other
than that speakers usually know the words for most of the plants
and animals in their environment and for all the artefacts and
cultural practices. There is little or no differentiation by occupa-
tion. Apart from some division along gender lines the whole
community is involved in the same hunting, planting, gathering,
tool making, preparation of food, and cooking. The same applies
to leisure activities. Games, singing, dancing, telling stories, recit-
ing poetry, asking riddles, and various forms of word play are
communal activities.
195
In a large-scale society, on the other hand, people are distinguished
by class, occupation, and recreational interests. In western society
there are hundreds of occupations and leisure pursuits, many with an
extensive specialized vocabulary or jargon. Individual speakers will
know the vocabulary they need for their own work and leisure, but
this will be only a fraction of the total vocabulary of the language.
Where a language is spoken in more than one location, dialect
differences will appear. In modern large-scale societies this differ-
entiation is more apparent in the colloquial language, especially
slang, which is relatively immune to standardizing inÔ¨Çuences and
tends to be promoted as a marker of local identity, though it is true
that there is national slang and at least one variety of international
slang disseminated from America via the media.
Groups who are oppressed, imprisoned, or isolated from the
community at large and those whose activities are under scrutiny
by the authorities tend to develop an extensive in-group variety of
language known as argot. The anonymous author of The Vulgar-
ities of Speech Corrected, published in 1826, wrote that slang ‚Äòis
chieÔ¨Çy what was invented, and is still used, like the cipher of
diplomatists, for the purposes of secrecy, and as a means of eluding
ofÔ¨Åcers‚Äô (McKnight 1928: 507). The writer is referring to what is
here called argot, this term not being in general use in the early
nineteenth century. An argot is colloquial and has the character of
slang, but some of its vocabulary is technically jargon in that it is
specialized and has no standard equivalents.1
1
Argot is a marker of a social class, typically low social class. In some
societies social stratiÔ¨Åcation is quite marked with special forms for addressing
people of high social status. In Javanese, for instance, there are three forms of
the language: ngoko, madya, and krama, which differ in vocabulary. In general
196
secret language
All of these specialized varieties present a source of potential
obscurity to anyone who knows only formal, mainstream language.
Jargon
As we have seen, then, large-scale societies are not homogeneous.
People have different occupations and recreational pursuits. If you
are involved in building work, you will be familiar with terms such
as beam, joist, stud, and truss. If you are interested in tennis, you
will know terms such as advantage, baseline, deuce, let, and love.
These specialized terms are jargon. They are a necessary part of the
language. You need to know them if you are going to talk about
certain activities. The difference between mainstream vocabulary
and jargon is ill deÔ¨Åned. Consider the terminology of food prep-
aration. There is a continuum from boil, fry, poach, roast, and stew,
which are generally known, through lesser-known terms such as
parboil and simmer to more esoteric terms like al dente, blanch,
macerate, marinate, and roux, which are part of the jargon of food
preparation. It is much the same with gardening, where terms like
trowel, spade, prune, and perhaps mulch are generally known, as are
some common names of plants such as rose and carnation, but
there are hundreds of lesser-known plant names, including learned
Greek and Latin botanical names.
people use ngoko at home and among friends, and in addressing people of
lower social standing; and krama, the high form, in addressing people of high
status in formal situations. They can use madya, the middle form, in ambiva-
lent contexts or where they are unsure about what is appropriate (Errington
1988). In Thailand there is a special form of the language that must be used in
talking to members of the royal family. This high style is replete with ‚Äòbig
words‚Äô of Pali and Khmer origin (Khanittanan 2005).
197
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
While a receptionist or salesperson probably uses few terms not in
general use, some occupations have large jargons. Armed services
jargon is replete with abbreviations such as adc ‚Äòaide-de-camp‚Äô, rsm
‚Äòregimental sergeant-major‚Äô, and wilco ‚Äòwill comply‚Äô. The law has
an extensive jargon of terms such as plaintiff, defendant, and contempt
(of court), and it includes Latin phrases such as habeas corpus ‚ÄòPro-
duce the body (of the arrested person)‚Äô, sine die ‚Äò(to be adjourned)
without a day (being Ô¨Åxed)‚Äô, and decree nisi, a decree which comes
into force after a stipulated period unless (nisi) an objection has been
lodged. Medicine and pharmacy also have an extensive jargon, a
small proportion of which is familiar outside the profession to health-
conscious amateurs, hypochondriacs, and viewers of relevant televi-
sion programmes. More secret is the system of Latin terms doctors
use in communicating with pharmacists, terms such as mane ‚Äòin the
morning‚Äô, a.c. (ante cibum) ‚Äòbefore meals‚Äô, nocte ‚Äòin the evening‚Äô, and
p.c. (post cibum) ‚Äòafter meals‚Äô.
Each sport has its own jargon and people who follow a number of
sports need to master a corresponding number of jargons. To list just
a few examples, baseball, basketball, billiards, bowling, boxing, car
racing, cricket, cycling, football, golf, hockey, horse racing, motor
racing, tennis, volley ball, and wrestling all have jargons consisting of
scores of terms, in some cases hundreds or even thousands.2
Closely
related to jargon is register, the style associated with a certain
2
Andy Pawley of the ANU informs me that one glossary of baseball
terminology runs to 5,000 entries and his own collection of cricket terms
runs to over 2,000 without being complete. A quick survey of some
glossaries of technical terms reveals the following Ô¨Ågures: architecture
4,500, cooking 22,000, gardening 6,000, medicine/nursing 44,000, music
3,000, nautical 8,000, sewing 800, and stocks and investment 2,300.

occupation, activity, or medium. An auctioneer, for instance, will use
stock expressions such as, ‚ÄòWhat am I bid for this?‚Äô, ‚ÄòAny advance on
¬£500?‚Äô, ‚ÄòAgainst you, madam/sir‚Äô, and ‚ÄòGoing, going, gone‚Äô.
In general there is no choice between using jargon and non-
specialist terms, but some speakers do use jargon to outsiders either
inadvertently or through a desire to impress. Certain types of learned
jargon and register seem to arise from a feeling that a serious subject
needs ‚Äòbig‚Äô words. Consider the following paragraph in a publication
from a leading geographical society:
The examples given suggest that the multiformity of environmental
apprehension and the exclusivity of abstract semantic conceptions
constitute a crucial distinction. Semantic responses to qualities,
environmental or other, tend to abstract each individual quality as
though it were to be considered in isolation, with nothing else
impinging.Butin actual environmental experience,ourjudgements
of attributes are constantly affected by the entire milieu, and the
connectivities such observations suggest reveal this multiform com-
plexity. Semantic response is generally a consequence of reductive
categorization, environmental response or synthesizing holism.
This is quoted in The Jargon of the Professions by Hudson, who
suggests the authors ‚Äòshould be locked up without food or water
until they can produce an acceptable translation‚Äô(1978: 87). I think
the passage simply means that in experiencing the environment we
need to look at it as a whole rather than at particular properties,
though I am at a loss to decode the Ô¨Årst sentence.3

I am unable to paraphrase the following example from an adminis-
trative memo. I wonder how many of the recipients felt the same. The
problem is a mixture of jargon and poor syntax.

199
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
When it comes to learned jargon English presents a problem that
is by no means common to all languages. English has borrowed
most of its learned vocabulary from Greek and Latin and the make-
up of these words is not always clear to the average person. Take
stamp collecting. We call a person who collects stamps a stamp
collector, a term which is perfectly transparent, but there is also
philatelist, which is not at all transparent. The term paediatrician is
not transparent, and is often thought to relate to feet in light of
words such as pedestrian, especially with the American spelling
pediatrician. In fact it means a doctor who specializes in children.
In German it is Kinderarzt, literally ‚Äòchildren-doctor‚Äô, a compound,
the make-up of which is perfectly plain to any speaker of German.
Although German has borrowed a few words from Greek and Latin,
it forms most of its learned words by compounding simple roots and
using its own preÔ¨Åxes and sufÔ¨Åxes.
Slang
In speaking and writing we have a choice between being formal or
informal. For example, I received your letter is formal but I got your
letter is informal or colloquial. Words and phrases that would be
deemed colloquial include no problem and see you later. Overlap-
ping with the term ‚Äòcolloquial‚Äô is the term ‚Äòslang‚Äô. The difference is
not clear-cut but is one of degree; we might start by saying that
slang means ‚Äòvery colloquial‚Äô. The verb to vomit is standard, to sick
up is informal or colloquial, and expressions such as to spray paint
of remoteness in determination of hard-to-staff schools devel-
oped under the total recruitment strategy.
200
secret language
or to have a technicolour yawn are slang. While ‚Äòcolloquial‚Äô has
positive or neutral connotations, the word ‚Äòslang‚Äô is often used
negatively. Many people do not see slang words as respectable or
legitimate. If someone tries to use nix in Scrabble, particularly if
they want to use the ‚Äòx‚Äô on a triple-score square, they are likely to
be told that nix is not a ‚Äòreal word‚Äô. Writers of yesteryear who have
bemoaned the use of slang include those once prominent guard-
ians of the English language, H.W. and F.G. Fowler, whose book
The King‚Äôs English was originally published in 1906 and reprinted
in several editions: ‚Äò . . . as style is the great antiseptic, so slang is the
great corrupting matter; it is perishable itself, and infects what is
round it‚Äîthe catchwords that delight one generation stink in the
nostrils of the next‚Äô (1931: 61). Greenough and Kittredge (1931: 55)
say that ‚Äòslang is commonly made by the use of harsh, violent or
ludicrous metaphors, obscure analogies, meaningless words, and
expressions derived from the less known and less esteemed voca-
tions or customs‚Äô.
Slang is covered here for a number of related reasons, some of
which are touched on in the above quotations. One, slang is
inventive, abounds in metaphor and allusion, and is often more
demanding or more opaque than the standard language. Two,
since slang is inventive, there is a good deal of turnover, with
fresh slang replacing existing slang. Three, slang tends to be local
and restricted to an area or a social group.
The Inventiveness of Slang
A number of writers on language remark approvingly on the
inventiveness of slang. Even the conservative H.W. Fowler,
writing at a later date than the quotation above, described
201
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
slang as ‚Äòthe diction that results from the favourite game
among the young and lively of playing with words and renam-
ing things and actions; some invent new words, or mutilate or
misapply the old, for the pleasure of novelty, and others catch
up such words for the pleasure of being in fashion‚Äô (Fowler
1926: 308).
Some slang words have different roots from their mainstream
counterparts and there is no particular motivation for the choice.
The once-popular London slang term nim ‚Äòto take‚Äô, for instance, is
a reÔ¨Çex of the Old English verb niman, whereas the standard
equivalent take comes from the Old Norse of the Viking invaders
and settlers. It could equally have happened that nim became the
mainstream word and take became slang or dialectal. However, the
great majority of slang terms are motivated in the sense that they
are composed by compounding or afÔ¨Åxation and tend to be
descriptive. An old slang term for clerk is the compound ink spiller,
which has obvious origins. Bread basket derives from the fact that
the stomach is a repository for bread, and cofÔ¨Ån nail for ‚Äòcigarette‚Äô
refers to the medical opinion that smoking shortens one‚Äôs lifespan.
Similar again are sufÔ¨Åxed terms like kisser for ‚Äòmouth‚Äô or the
obsolete prancer for ‚Äòhorse‚Äô. There are also colloquial-forming
sufÔ¨Åxes such as those found in brekkie, brekker, and brekkers
‚Äòbreakfast‚Äô, which change the connotations, as do abbreviations
as in prof, staph, strep, tute, ex div, and tlc.
Alliteration is frequently used to create catchy slang expressions
such as bible basher, greedy guts, and thunder thighs, and rhyme is a
fertile source, as in barber starver ‚Äòa man who lets his hair grow
long‚Äô, bum chum ‚Äòmale homosexual‚Äô, chick Ô¨Çick ‚Äòa movie aimed at
female audiences‚Äô, fake bake ‚Äòsuntan achieved by lamp or bottle‚Äô,
202
secret language
mop chop ‚Äòhaircut‚Äô, pooper scooper ‚Äòa tool for picking up dog mess‚Äô,
rugger bugger ‚Äòmacho young man‚Äô, and tin grin ‚Äòorthodontal braces‚Äô.
Metaphor plays a large part in slang. A few generations ago the
motor car provided a popular source of metaphor with expressions
such as to be in overdrive, to blow a gasket, to be (really) motoring
(along), and to be sparking on all four (cylinders). More recently
electricity provided a number of examples, including AC/DC, to
light up, to press the right switches, to be switched on, and to turn
someone on or off. Various sports have contributed metaphors.
From boxing we have below the belt, knockout, and throw in the
towel, from cricket sticky wicket, clean bowled, and hit for six.
Striking similes include to be Ô¨Çat out like a lizard drinking (said
of someone having to work hard), to charge like a wounded bull (of
someone demanding high prices), and to have more push than a
revolving door (of someone forceful or pushy). Expressions like
these involve two different senses of the key words, one literal
and the other metaphorical. Some similes are based on paradox, for
instance runs in the family like wooden legs or sweating like a pig
(pigs don‚Äôt sweat). Colourful exaggeration, a regular feature of
light-hearted conversation, is lexicalized in timber merchant, a
British slang term for ‚Äòmatch seller‚Äô.4
Slang expressions tend to be self-consciously inventive, but
some are rather forced and probably too clever to achieve wide
circulation or longevity. In his Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue
(1785, 1811) Grose gives Athanasian wench for a woman of easy

legally begging rather than someone hoping to make money by the sale of

203
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
virtue. It is based on the Ô¨Årst words of the Latin version of the
Athanasian Creed, namely Quicumque vult ‚ÄòWhoever wishes‚Äô, a
prayer included in the Book of Common Prayer with these Latin
words as its title. Partridge (1960: 34) gives gone to the Diet of Worms
for ‚Äòto be dead‚Äô. In South African English de Klerk (2006) records
act like jeans and fade ‚Äògo away‚Äô and blow some zeds ‚Äòsleep‚Äô‚Äîan
expression which presumably relates to the representation of sleep
in comic strips.
Another method of forming colloquial if not slang terms is
deliberate malformation, as in picture-askew for ‚Äòpicturesque‚Äô and
trick cyclist for ‚Äòpsychiatrist‚Äô. The French phrase faux pas has
sometimes been pronounced as fox‚Äôs paw or fox paw since the
eighteenth century. These deformations are of the folk etymology
type in that an exotic original is associated with familiar words.
Another slang mechanism is the formation of pseudo-learned
words, as in obstropolous (and its abbreviation stroppy) for obstrep-
erous, and rumbumptious for rambunctious. Slang often contains
malapropisms such as What are you incinerating? for What are you
insinuating? These probably start off as deliberate attempts at
humour, but it is uncertain whether all users are conscious of the
substitution.
Slang is by deÔ¨Ånition informal, but it is also often irreverent, as
with (cat)gut scraper for ‚Äòviolinist‚Äô, scandal broth for ‚Äòtea‚Äô, and louse
trap or Ô¨Çea rake for ‚Äòcomb‚Äô. An eighteenth-century hotel in Covent
Garden that gloried in the name The Golden Lion was dubbed by
locals The Yellow Cat, and The Eagle and Child in Oxford has been
The Bird and Baby for some hundreds of years. A streak of
dysphemism is evidenced in terms like Ô¨Çoating cofÔ¨Ån ‚Äòunseaworthy
boat‚Äô, while the eighteenth-century expression fart catcher for an
204
secret language
attendant who walks a few paces behind his master is a clear
attempt at crudery. Similarly, cock-rag has a crude transparency
which is lacking in the anthropologist‚Äôs ‚Äòphallocrypt‚Äô. Unpleasant
slang is proliÔ¨Åc and includes terms such as brown nose or brown
tongue for a sycophant (or ‚Äòcrawler‚Äô), Ô¨Çy cemetery (currant cake),
frog spawn (sago), snot block (vanilla slice), snot rag (handkerchief),
and nun‚Äôs fart (cream puff).5
There is also a deliberate insensitivity in the use of light-hearted,
off-hand descriptions of serious conditions. A diseased penis is said
to have knob rot and death is treated lightly in expressions such as
kick the bucket or fall off the perch, or lead poisoning for someone
who has been shot. In the same vein are obsolete phrases for death
by hanging such as hempen fever, hearty choke, and wry mouth.
These jocular expressions for death are similar to the impulse
towards comedy in the face of tragedy. Slang and humour often
go hand in hand.
Is Slang Ephemeral?
Some dictionaries include ‚Äòephemeral‚Äô in their deÔ¨Ånition of
slang, and Greenough and Kittredge (1931: 73) claim that ‚ÄòSlang
words . . . are evanescent, counting their duration by days instead
of decades, and becoming obsolete even while one is speaking
them. Hence slang is ill-adapted to serve as a medium of inter-
course.‚Äô While it is true that most slang is short-lived, many slang
words endure for centuries. To lift ‚Äòto steal‚Äô (cf. shoplifter, shop-
lifting) has been around since the sixteenth century, the police
have been called pigs since the late seventeenth century, and
5

jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
booze, which was borrowed into Middle English from Middle
Dutch b
usen ‚Äòto drink‚Äô, has been current as a noun as well as a
verb ever since, and has spawned other slang expressions such as
boozer ‚Äòpub‚Äô or ‚Äòheavy drinker‚Äô, booze-up ‚Äòdrinking spree‚Äô, and
booze artist ‚Äòheavy drinker‚Äô. The terms Grose lists in his Diction-
ary of the Vulgar Tongue (1785, 1811) include many that are still
current: bum fodder ‚Äòtoilet paper‚Äô, claret ‚Äòblood‚Äô, clink ‚Äòjail‚Äô, clod
hopper ‚Äòcountry bumpkin‚Äô, crocodile tears ‚Äòinsincere tears‚Äô, duds
‚Äòclothes‚Äô, elbow grease ‚Äòhard work‚Äô, Ô¨Çabby, French leave, gob, guts,
hick, to hump ‚Äòcopulate with‚Äô, nix, in queer street ‚Äòbankrupt‚Äô, riff
raff, to pump (somebody for information). Others such as physog
(from physiognomy) ‚Äòface‚Äô and to plant ‚Äòhide‚Äô (intransitive and
transitive) lasted into the twentieth century, but are perhaps
obsolete now.
Words may change their status over time. Some words that
began their life in English as slang achieved respectability. These
include bamboozle, banter, bigot, bus (an abbreviation of the Latin
omnibus ‚Äòfor all‚Äô), carouse (from the German (trinken) gar aus ‚Äòdrink
right out‚Äô), frisk, hoax (from the pseudo-Latin phrase hocus pocus),
mob (an abbreviation of the Latin phrase mobile vulgus ‚Äòthe Ô¨Åckle
common people‚Äô), shabby, sham, and tandem (a Latin adverb
meaning ‚Äòat length‚Äô). In the nineteenth century tandem was a
colloquial term for a vehicle pulled by two horses one behind the
other. It was later applied to ‚Äòa bicycle built for two‚Äô, but since it is
the only term for such a bicycle in this context it counts as a
technical term rather than slang.6
Some of the phrases listed above

The phrase ‚Äòa bicycle built for two‚Äô comes from the popular song

started as educated slang. Other words have moved up the social
scale, including pal, which came into English slang from Romani
(Romany), the language of the Gypsies, and today is standard,
albeit colloquial.
Local Slang
It has been characteristic of slang over the centuries to be socially
and geographically restricted‚Äîi.e. conÔ¨Åned to particular areas,
particular strata in society, and particular interest groups. At one
extreme slang may be peculiar to a particular factory, university, or
school, even to particular forms within a school. At the other
extreme it may cover a whole country, as with New Zealand
slang or South African slang. To the extent that it is restricted it
is unsuitable for formal purposes, which often involves communi-
cation with the language community at large.
Part of the attraction of slang lies in its esoteric character. It is a
good marker of identity, a language of the in-group and of soli-
darity. Groups of slang users from particular areas, including
particular countries, are usually proud of their slang. They con-
sider it smart and colourful and use it self-consciously, with the
more imaginative speakers contributing new terms. It is interesting
to note the large number of publications dedicated to listing slang
terms; many of these are put together by amateurs who are
motivated by interest if not pride in the variety of slang they are
recording.
Nowadays American slang is propagated via pop music, Ô¨Ålms,
and television. It permeates the English-speaking world and
spreads into other languages. In German, for instance, one can
ausÔ¨Çippen ‚ÄòÔ¨Çip out‚Äô or abchecken ‚Äòcheck out (something or
207
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
someone)‚Äô. Such widespread slang can still serve as a marker of
identity. As particular terms are spread, they are largely picked up
by the young, and a knowledge of the latest American slang can
mark you as ‚Äòwith it‚Äô or ‚Äòcool‚Äô. This is particularly true of the
current slang of young African Americans. As Eble reports, ‚ÄòThe
fashionable value of the style invented by African American youth
in urban ghettos has given international cachet to hip-hop slang
such as dawg, Ô¨Çoss, holla back, pimp, playa, props, and word. Thanks
to the new means of communication, youth around the world who
have never met or spoken to an African American jockey for social
status among their peers by using the slang popularized by hip-
hop‚Äô (Eble 2006: 414).7
The Slang Lexicon
It is commonplace in linguistics to point out that languages differ
not only in grammar and lexicon, but also in the set of concepts for
which they have words. Each language encapsulates a particular
world view, in fact a language can encapsulate different world
views at different times and more than one view at a particular
time. With respect to change over time consider the now obsolete
view of marriage reÔ¨Çected in terms such as to be jilted, breach of
promise, old maid, and to be (left) on the shelf. More relevant here
7
Eble gives other examples of international slang. Devotees of the
television series Buffy, the Vampire Slayer (1997‚Äì2003) use a distinctive
vocabulary in communicating through e-mail, chat rooms, Web sites, and
magazines. Players of the role-playing game Shadowrun form a worldwide
community and have a Web site for their own slang, which includes
sidewalk outline for ‚Äòa recently deceased person‚Äô, a reference to the chalk
outline of a body at a murder scene.
208
secret language
are the differences of conceptualization between the standard
language and its colloquial varieties. Although in many instances
slang provides informal alternatives for standard words, as with
saw-bones for ‚Äòsurgeon‚Äô, in some cases it expresses a different set of
concepts. Consider the words pecs, abs, and glutes, which came into
vogue in the 1990s. They are derived from pectoral muscles, abdom-
inal muscles, and gluteal muscles, terms which play practically no
part in the standard language. The abbreviated forms arose in the
context of advertising which exploited the sex appeal of the semi-
naked male body. They represent new concepts. Errol Flynn and
Clark Gable did not have pecs, abs, and glutes.
While slang by no means offers equivalents for every word in
the standard lexicon, for some referents it is rich in synonyms.
Partridge (1960: 29) remarks that ‚Äòthe less ‚Äúreputable‚Äù an action or
object, the more synonyms‚Äô. Writing of French slang Guiraud
(1985: 43) notes that there are words for denigration, jubilation,
satiety, boredom, and irritation, but not for compassion, tolerance,
generosity, altruism, or tenderness. A survey of English slang over
the centuries reveals that around a thousand slang terms for penis
and vagina are or have been used somewhere in the English-
speaking world at one time or another, with words for sexual
acts, excretion, and bodily efÔ¨Çuvia also rating highly.8
Terms of
approval (swell, awesome, great, groovy, unreal ) are common, but
generally short-lived, as are terms of disapproval. Alcohol, money,
and drugs give rise to numerous slang terms, along with terms for
physical characteristics (carrot-top, titch, shorty, lofty) and physical
deÔ¨Åciencies (spaso/spaz). There is a welter of terms for mental
8
See Fryer 1964: 69‚Äì85 for some Ô¨Ågures and numerous examples.

deÔ¨Åciency or insanity: barmy, bats (in the belfry), cracked, crackers,
crackpot, cranky, dippy, dotty, loopy, lost his/her marbles, mad as a
hatter, nuts, nutty as a fruitcake, potty, a screw loose, a shingle short,
two bob short in the pound, two sandwiches short of a picnic, and for a
stupid person: blockhead, bonehead, dill, dope, donkey, drip, drongo,
dunderhead, and nong. Of a person showing signs of senile demen-
tia it is likely to be said the lights are on but no one‚Äôs at home.
There are more colloquial terms for a woman as a provider of
sex, whether in a professional or amateur capacity, than for any
other referent. There are expressions such as a bike, a bit of a goer,
been around a bit, been around the block a few times, ho, moll/mole,
no better than she should be, tart, slut, and an easy lay. This
proliferation is reÔ¨Çected in the language in general, with terms
such as harlot, strumpet, trollop, and whore, or the old-fashioned
woman of easy virtue.9
It is interesting to note that the double
standard that condemns women‚Äôs sexual activity while lauding
men‚Äôs is not only seen in the large number of terms for promiscu-
ous women, but in the fact that some words have negative conno-
tations when applied to women, but not so negative when applied
to men. A fast woman is a promiscuous one, but a fast man is a
good sprinter, and if he is a fast worker, then he is good at attracting
females. A loose woman is promiscuous, but a loose man, at least in
Australian football, is one who has evaded his opponents and is in
a position to receive the ball unopposed. A fallen woman is one
who has turned to prostitution, but a fallen soldier is one who has
died for his country.

SigniÔ¨Åcantly strumpet, trollop, and whore all have, or have had,
colloquial variants: strum, troll, and the currently popular ho.

off, scat, vamoose. Closely related are other dismissive imperatives
such as Get stuffed!, Go to blazes!, and Go to hell! Slang is also rich in
exclamatory words and phrases like Beauty!, What the blazes?!, Stiff
cheese!, Blow me down!, and My oath!
Argots and ‚ÄòSecret Languages‚Äô
The tendency for slang to be geographically local or associated with a
particular group of people is epitomized in argot. This is a body of
non-standard vocabulary used by a group bound by common interest,
isolation, or their opposition to authority. The word ‚Äòargot‚Äô is trad-
itionally associated with those who live outside the law: burglars,
cardsharps, conÔ¨Ådence tricksters (grifters), highwaymen, pickpockets,
racketeers, swindlers, thieves, and the like, and is sometimes referred to
as ‚Äòthieves‚Äô slang‚Äô. But argots have also been in use among other groups
who tend to be itinerant: beggars, entertainers, Gypsies, circus folk,
vagrants, and travelling tradesmen such as chimney sweeps, knife
sharpeners, masons, tinkers, and window cleaners. Those who supply
goods or services without having a shop are traditional users of an
argot, people such as street vendors or market stall-holders. Prostitutes,
drug dealers, and gays have their own argots, as do prisoners and
schoolchildren. Argot is included in what Halliday calls anti-language,
which he describes as a special form of language used to maintain social
structure by anti-society, a society within a larger society set up as an
alternative, in some cases a hostile alternative‚Äô (Halliday 1976: 570).
In most argots the bulk of the distinctive vocabulary is derived
by the usual word-building processes, though some argots use their
211
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
own peculiar sufÔ¨Åxes (see p. 237). Some vocabulary is borrowed.
Yiddish, a Germanic language used in some Jewish communities,
and Romani, the language of the Gypsies, have both been a source
of vocabulary for various European argots, a not unexpected
development since Jews and Gypsies tended to be denied access
to mainstream occupations. Part of the motivation for argot is to
maintain in-group solidarity, and part is to provide a secret code
that will not be understood by targets of criminal activity or the
authorities. Some of this secrecy is achieved via a special vocabu-
lary, and some by means of systematic phonological distortion of
the Pig Latin type. This is covered under ‚ÄòSecret languages‚Äô below.
In some circumstances the use of a language not known to the
authorities provides a ready-made in-group tongue. In geograph-
ical areas which experience invasion, the indigenous vernaculars
serve as in-group languages. English had this status for over two
hundred years after the Norman French invasion of 1066, which
introduced a French-speaking ruling class, but for most of its
history English has been an invading language, particularly from
the seventeenth century onwards.
Since argots are often found among those engaged in illicit or
illegal activities, it is not surprising that there are numerous terms
for authorities (the old bill, coppers, pigs), for evading authorities (to
scarper, to do a runner, to be on the lam), and for types of crime and
criminal, means of carrying out crime, penalties, and prisons.
Some argot terms have no equivalent in the standard language
and while having the Ô¨Çavour of slang, they qualify as jargon. These
include angler, an old term for a thief who steals using a hook on
the end of a long stick, a snowdropper, someone who steals washing
from clotheslines, and the modern shoulder-surÔ¨Ång, which is
212
secret language
observing someone‚Äôs pin number at an ATM for future use. Some
of the argot passes into mainstream usage when an activity comes
to the attention of a wider public, as has happened with pimp and
more recently supergrass.
Gay argot has a number of terms for which there is no simple
equivalent in the standard language. These include the terms bean
queen (a male homosexual in the USA who likes partners from
south of the border), chicken queen (likes young partners), curry
queen (likes South Asian partners), and rice queen (likes East Asian
partners). A green queen is active in parks and cottaging is gay
activity in public toilets.10
Argot in England
One of the argots we know most about is the argot of thieves and
vagabonds in the London area from the sixteenth century on, from
sources such as Harman (1567). This argot was generally called
‚Äòcant‚Äô, but the term ‚Äòcant‚Äô was also used for jargon and its associated
register, so that people would talk about lawyer‚Äôs cant (Gotti 1999).
Like slang in general it had an elaborate vocabulary for anything
connected with sex, and as expected a large vocabulary of terms for
criminals and criminal activity. In Grose‚Äôs A Dictionary of the
Vulgar Tongue (1785, 1811) there are about four thousand entries,
of which over three hundred are for types of malefactor and types of
crime. The criminals include badgers (who rob and murder near
rivers), boung nippers (cutpurses), cloak twitchers (who snatch cloaks
10
Cottaging takes its name from the fact that public toilets in public
parks in Britain were built to look like cottages, a kind of architectural
euphemism.
213
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
from passers by), cracksmen (burglars), forks (pickpockets), glazyers
(burglars who break windows or remove panes), jarkmen (counter-
feiters), jumpers (burglars who enter by a window), rushers (who
rush in when the door of a house is opened), and scourers (roaming
bucks who break windows, assault passers by, etc.). The tools of the
trade include cracking tools such as the betty or jemmy, the latter
still in current usage. There is a set of terms for those involved
in conÔ¨Ådence tricks with card games. The person who Ô¨Årst
approached the mark (the cousin or coney) was the setter or taker-up.
He was joined by the verser and the two of them play the part of
sophisticated gentlemen who gain the mark‚Äôs conÔ¨Ådence. They and
the mark are joined by the barnard or barnacle, who appears to be
drunk or stupid or both. The mark is induced to play cards against
the barnard, who invariably wins. Someone employed to start a
diversion if necessary was a rutter. There are about a hundred terms
for a promiscuous woman and another hundred for a man who is
stupid, gullible, or a greenhorn (to quote one of the words in Grose
that is still current today, particularly in US English).
As with slang in general, some of this argot consisted of different
roots from those in the standard language, such as nab ‚Äòhead‚Äô,
fambles ‚Äòhands‚Äô, and cank ‚Äòdumb‚Äô, but the greater part of the
vocabulary is descriptive in the sense that it is a compound or
afÔ¨Åxed root picking out a characteristic of a referent or a meta-
phorical description. A streak of humour runs through the tradi-
tional argot. Prisons were often described as schools, as in the
contemporary College of Correction, and the hulks used to accom-
modate prisoners were the Ô¨Çoating academies. Brothels were con-
vents or nunneries, the prostitutes who worked in them were nuns,
and the madam was an abbess.
214
secret language
In the English argot compounding was prominent. For instance,
some body parts were formed from a descriptive participle and chete/
cheat ‚Äòthing‚Äô: crashing chetes ‚Äòteeth‚Äô, hearing chetes ‚Äòears‚Äô, smelling chete
‚Äònose‚Äô, and prattling chete or prating chete ‚Äòtongue‚Äô. Similar forma-
tions were used for farm animals: bleting chete ‚Äòlamb‚Äô, cackling chete
‚Äòchicken‚Äô, grunting chete ‚Äòpig‚Äô, lowing chete ‚Äòcow‚Äô, and quacking chete
‚Äòduck‚Äô. There were compounds with law ‚Äòactivity‚Äô or ‚Äòway‚Äô: cheating
law ‚Äòcheating at cards or dice‚Äô, curbing law ‚Äòstealing by means of a
hook on a stick‚Äô, Ô¨Ågging law ‚Äòpickpocketing‚Äô, lifting law ‚Äòstealing of
parcels‚Äô, prigging law ‚Äòhorse stealing‚Äô, and sacking law ‚Äòprostitution‚Äô.
Ken ‚Äòhouse‚Äô or ‚Äòpremises‚Äô, a word borrowed from Romani, the
language of the Gypsies, was also used a lot in compounds:
croppin-ken ‚Äòprivy, toilet‚Äô, Ô¨Çash ken ‚Äòhouse that harbours thieves‚Äô,
quyerkyn ‚Äòprison‚Äô (quyer [queer] ¬º ‚Äòbad‚Äô), smuggling ken and snoozing
ken ‚Äòbrothel‚Äô, staulinge ken ‚Äòreceiver‚Äôs, fence‚Äôs‚Äô, and touting-ken
‚Äòalehouse, tavern‚Äô.11
A number of body parts were named by taking a characteristic
or function and adding the -er noun-forming sufÔ¨Åx: grinders
‚Äòteeth‚Äô, heavers ‚Äòbreasts‚Äô, panter ‚Äòheart‚Äô, and smiter ‚Äòbottom‚Äô.
Hands were called pickers and stealers, a phrase that occurs in
Hamlet.12
The same sufÔ¨Åx appeared in lifters ‚Äòcrutches‚Äô, prauncer
(prancer) ‚Äòhorse‚Äô, spreader ‚Äòbutter‚Äô, and stampers ‚Äòshoes‚Äô. It is also in
peepers, which at one time meant ‚Äòmirror‚Äô but later ‚Äòeyes‚Äô, a usage
11
The examples are from various sources, but most can be found in
Gotti 1999.

215
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
that continued into the twentieth century in expressions such as
park your peepers on the pony ‚Äòhave a look at the horse‚Äô.
The plural marker is used as a derivational sufÔ¨Åx in words such as
dindins, cuddles, preggers. It is also combined with man to give the
sufÔ¨Åx -mans, which is used to derive nouns from adjectives. Examples
include crackmans ‚Äòhedges‚Äô, darkmans ‚Äònight‚Äô, greenmans ‚ÄòÔ¨Åelds‚Äô, har-
mans ‚Äòstocks‚Äô, lightmans ‚Äòday‚Äô, and ruffmans ‚Äòforest, woods, bushes‚Äô.
Where borrowing was concerned, the oldest stratum was from
Latin, but there were also borrowings from French, Italian, and, as
we have seen, Romani and Yiddish. The apparently Italian borrow-
ings are likely to have come from Lingua Franca, the Romance-based
pidgin of the Mediterranean, probably introduced by seamen. The
term cant itself is from Latin/Italian cantare ‚Äòto sing‚Äô and may result
from the tendency of beggars in the past to chant their pleas.
bene good (Latin/Italian bene) as in bene cofe ‚Äòa good fellow‚Äô,
also benely ‚Äòwell‚Äô

Back Slang
In Britain there has been a form of secret language called back
slang since at least the early nineteenth century. It is reported to
have been in use in England among food vendors such as butchers
and greengrocers, and among street sellers, those who sold goods
from barrows or stalls, especially the costermongers who sold fruit,
vegetables, and ‚ÄòÔ¨Åsh‚Äô (‚Äòseafood‚Äô in current terminology). Back slang
allowed dodgy vendors to converse in front of unwary customers,
but it must have been known to at least some of the regular
clientele. It is essentially a system of enciphering words by taking
the written forms and pronouncing them backwards. It resembles
the play languages or secret languages described later in this
chapter, which involve systematic phonological alteration of
words, but is based on English spelling and is therefore a lot less
systematic than most other ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô. The fact that it is
based on spelling is interesting in that most of the street sellers
were illiterate, but some could read and there was a class of
patterers‚Äîvendors who excelled in patter or clever spiel‚Äîmany
of whom had various degrees of education. Although back slang
was essentially a means of encipherment and could be used on an
ad hoc basis, a back slang lexicon developed and this extended far
beyond the needs of the costers. Early reports are from London
(Hotten 1864, 1874; Mayhew 1851), but it is not certain whether
back slang was peculiar to that area or just that we happen to have
reports from the capital.
The basic principle of back slang is that each word is pro-
nounced backwards:
217
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
Ô¨Åsh ! shif
look ! cool
market ! tekram
no good ! on doog
yes ! say
Although back slang was spoken, it was based on the written
language, and the sequence of letters is reversed except for a few
digraphs that represent a single phoneme like sh in Ô¨Åsh (see above).
This reversing leads to problems in a language like English with its
highly irregular relationship between sound and spelling and its
constraints on which sounds can appear in various positions in a
syllable.13
For instance, reversing a word like hat raises a problem
since /h/ cannot occur at the end of a syllable, so ch or tch was
usually substituted, but in some cases sh.
hat ! tatch
half ! Ô¨Çatch (note the silent ‚Äòl‚Äô makes an appearance)
have ! vatch
home ! eemosh
Where the reversal would produce a consonant cluster outside the
normal range for English an unstressed vowel (i.e. /@/) could be
inserted:
13
There is also a Javanese version of back slang. In Javanese there is a
close correspondence between phonology and orthography, so there are
none of the problems that arise in English, and one cannot easily distin-
guish whether the back slang is based on speech or writing.

hacob uki nanalod usa
‚ÄòThe boy is playing with the dog‚Äô
218
secret language
back slang ! kecab genals
cold ! deloc
lamb ! bemal
long ! genol
old ! delo
penny ! yennep
Another possibility was to pronounce the name of a letter, so that,
for instance, the Ô¨Ånal l in girl was pronounced el.
girl ! elrig
knife ! eeÔ¨Ånk
lamb ! beemal (alternative to bemal)
old ! deelo (alternative to delo)
pork ! kayrop
Adherence to the spelling produces odd relationships in pronun-
ciation between the original and the back slang version:
apple ! elpa (also helpa)
bone ! enob, eenob
cow ! woc
door ! rude
one ! eno (doogeno ‚Äòa good one‚Äô, dabeno ‚Äòa bad one‚Äô)
pot of beer ! top o‚Äô reeb
thirteen ! neetrith
two ! owt
week ! kew
The plural ‚Äòs‚Äô is usually excluded from the reversal, as in the
following examples:
greens ! neergs
turnip tops ! pinurt pots
However, the ‚Äòs‚Äô is retained where the referent normally occurs in
pairs or groups:
219
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
balls ! slab
cherries ! siretch14
nuts ! stun
The unusual relation between the singular and plural of woman is
handled by using namow (or nemow) for ‚Äòwoman‚Äô and adding s to
form a plural namows.
There appears to have been some variation in how much speech
was enciphered. In some instances back slang was only used for a
few key words, as in ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been doing bloody dab (bad) with my tol
(lot) ‚Äôn‚Äô ha‚Äôn‚Äôt made a yennep (penny), s‚Äôelp me‚Äô. In other cases all
lexical words were enciphered, but function words were left intact,
though in the third example below, at becomes ta.
doing badly ! doing dab
Look at him ! Cool ‚Äôim
Look at the old woman ! Cool ta delo nemow
Two words have moved from back slang into wider currency. Yob,
a back slang version of boy, is a well-known colloquialism for
‚Äòundesirable young man‚Äô, and ecaf ‚Äòface‚Äô and its abbreviated form
eek has some currency in British slang, including Polari (see p. 225).
Otherwise back slang seems to be dying, as are many other forms
of secret communication. Oddly the principle lives on in joke
14
Cherries is interesting. The back slang retains the s as in siretch. The
word came into Old English as ciris via Latin, ultimately from Greek
kerasos. Since cherries normally occur in the groups, the Ô¨Ånal -s was taken
to be a plural marker. The makers of back slang seem to have reversed the
process by taking the sibilant to be an integral part of the stem. It appears
that the fact that cherries occur in groups has had two different outcomes.
First it led to the Ô¨Ånal sibilant being taken as a plural marker and then it
led to the plural marker being taken as part of the stem.

secret language
names for properties and businesses, such as renroc ‚Äòcorner‚Äô and
emoh ruo ‚Äòour home‚Äô (also the name of a 1985 satirical Ô¨Ålm).
Rhyming Slang
A form of in-group communication that has been traditional
among Cockneys since the nineteenth century is rhyming slang
(Hotten 1874). Rhyming slang is not conÔ¨Åned to Cockneys and
there are sporadic reports of its use from various parts of the
English-speaking world. A certain social stigma has been attached
to it, and it is sometimes associated with the criminal classes, but in
fact it is used across a wide social spectrum, mainly by males.
Basically it consists of a rhyming phrase substituted for a word so
that, for instance, ‚Äòeyes‚Äô becomes mince pies, ‚Äòmouth‚Äô becomes
north and south, and ‚Äònose‚Äô becomes I suppose.
Rhyming slang has something of a secret code about it, since the
referent is not always clear to the uninitiated. It becomes more
cryptic when the rhyming element is omitted. In the television
series Minder dodgy used-car saleman Arthur Daley used to talk
about getting on the dog. The dog is the dog and bone, that is, the
phone. In the following exchange from the episode Poetic Justice,
innit? he is acting as foreman of a jury.
upperclass female juror The man‚Äôs clearly guilty. You
only have to look at his face.
arthur daley Madam, with respect. A man‚Äôs
boat is hardly the foundation on
which to base a conviction.
indian juror What is boat? I do not under-
stand.
arthur daley Boat race, madam.
221
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
Arthur assumes that supplying the missing rhyme from the rhym-
ing slang phrase boat race is sufÔ¨Åcient. He fails to explain that it
refers to face, though this can be guessed from the context.
A particularly obscure term is oliver as in, ‚ÄòDo you oliver?‚Äô
meaning ‚ÄòDo you understand?‚Äô Oliver is short for Oliver Crom-
well, which in the traditional pronunciation was crummel or
crumble, the rhyme for ‚Äòto tumble‚Äô in the sense of ‚Äòto understand‚Äô
(Matthews 1938: 133).15
When we talk about someone rabbiting on, we are using a word
derived from rhyming slang. Rabbit is short for rabbit and pork,
rhyming slang for ‚Äòtalk‚Äô (originally for the noun and later for the
verb). If someone is rabbiting on, they are talking at length. Other
examples of expressions that started life as rhyming slang but have
come into more general use include brass tacks for ‚Äòfacts‚Äô, chew the
fat for ‚Äòchat‚Äô, and Dutch treat, which was originally rhyming slang
for ‚Äòeat‚Äô but has come to mean a meal in a caf√© or restaurant
where two or more persons pay their own share, i.e. ‚Äòthey go
Dutch‚Äô.
Here are a few lines heavily laden with rhyming slang terms.
The key can be found below.
When ‚Äòe come ‚Äòome from the rubbidy, I could see ‚Äôe was
Brahms. ‚Äòe‚Äôd been on the ol‚Äô Aristotle. ‚Äòis I-suppose was red

The current pronunciation of Cromwell is a spelling pronunciation.
The [w] sound at the beginning of an unstressed syllable was generally
lost, as it still is in Norwich, Dulwich, etc., but it has been restored on the
basis of the spelling in words like midwife, housewife, etc.
222
secret language
Some terms have had different meanings at different times.
Rory o‚ÄôMore was once rhyming slang for ‚ÄòÔ¨Çoor‚Äô, but came to
refer to ‚Äòdoor‚Äô, and also ‚Äòwhore‚Äô, according to Partridge (1960:
274‚Äì5). Conversely some referents have been allotted different
rhymes at different times. In the nineteenth century ‚Äòmouth‚Äô
was east and south, but has long been replaced by north and
south.
Local variants of rhyming slang occur in various parts of the
world. In Australia ‚ÄòGive us a look‚Äô is Give us a Captain Cook or
just Give us a Captain, ‚Äòtrouble‚Äô is froth and bubble, and a prostitute
is a mallee root.16

Parlyaree and Polari
An argot developed among itinerant entertainers in Britain as
early as the seventeenth century called Parlyaree or Parlary (vari-
ously spelt), which is thought to be from Italian parlare ‚Äòto speak‚Äô.
The entertainers in question included jugglers, clowns, Ô¨Åre eaters,
trapeze artists, singers, monkey trainers, various musicians includ-
ing organ grinders, puppeteers, and, until the nineteenth century,
almost all actors, since there was little permanent urban theatre
224
secret language
before that time. These performers travelled around performing
in shows or busking at fairs or markets and on the streets. The
argot contains a number of Italian words. Varda ‚Äòsee‚Äô is likely to
be from northern Italian vardar (from guardare), and homa ‚Äòman‚Äô
and bona ‚Äògood‚Äô may reÔ¨Çect southern Italian forms which lack the
diphthong that developed in standard Italian uomo and buono/
buona. Other Italian words include dona [donna] ‚Äòfemale‚Äô, feielia
[Ô¨Åglia] ‚Äòchild‚Äô, and phrases such as the following (Mayhew 1851:
449‚Äì50):
How are you getting on?
Ultra cateva [oltre cattiva ¬º very bad]
Questra homa a vardring the slum, scarper it.
Quest‚Äôuomo sta vedendo the slum, scapa (it)
This man is looking at the slum, beat it!
As with the Italian element in British argot generally, Hancock
(1984b) suggests that some of these words may have been brought
in by returning seamen from Lingua Franca, the Romance-based
pidgin of the Mediterranean ports, though he recognizes that
many entered the argot in the nineteenth century from the promi-
nence of Italian immigrants among itinerant entertainers. In a
more recent paper Hajek (2002) suggests that most of the Italian
words in what he calls Parlaree were introduced by these Italian
immigrants, and he suggests that the evidence for earlier borrow-
ings from Lingua Franca is weak.
Polari is a British argot of gay culture that grew out of Parlyaree.
This development is natural enough considering that male homo-
sexual activity was illegal, so there was need of a secret language to
225
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
conceal such activity from outsiders, especially the undercover
police. Given that gays are often to be found among performers,
it is not surprising that they mainained a version of the itinerant
performer argot. Polari came into wider view when it was featured
in the BBC radio programme Round the Horne (1964‚Äì9). An
‚Äòouting‚Äô of this kind is not beneÔ¨Åcial to an argot, but after male
homosexuality between consenting adults was legalized in Britain
in 1967 and the Gay Rights movement became active around the
same time, the need for a secret form of language somewhat
diminished and Polari vocabulary came into more general use.
Like its predecessor, Polari is a small set of distinct lexical items,
many of which are of Italian origin, including buvare ‚Äòdrink‚Äô (verb
and noun), capella/capello ‚Äòhat‚Äô, dinarly ‚Äòmoney‚Äô, manjarie and
jarrie ‚Äòfood/eat‚Äô, and parlare pipe ‚Äòtelephone‚Äô. Jewish theatre was
established in the East End of London in the late nineteenth
century and Yiddish contributed words such as meese/mies ‚Äòplain,
ugly‚Äô, meshigener/meshugener ‚Äòmad, crazy‚Äô, and shyker ‚Äòwig‚Äô [Yiddish
sheitel/shaitel ]. This is part of a more general contribution of
Yiddish to colloquial English, a contribution that includes gelt
‚Äòmoney‚Äô, shlep ‚Äòto have to carry a burden or to have to travel on a
burdensome journey‚Äô, and shtum/shtoom ‚Äòquiet‚Äô, ‚Äòdumb‚Äô, especially
in the phrase ‚Äòto keep shtum‚Äô. English words used in a special
sense included blue ‚Äòhomosexual‚Äô, chicken ‚Äòyoung male‚Äô, cottage
‚Äòpublic toilet‚Äô, crimper ‚Äòhairdresser‚Äô, dish ‚Äòbuttocks‚Äô, fruit ‚Äòhomo-
sexual‚Äô, trade ‚Äòsex‚Äô, tootsie trade ‚Äòpassive role in homosexual sex‚Äô.
There was some rhyming slang such as vera (Lynn) ‚Äògin‚Äô and some
back slang such as riah ‚Äòhair‚Äô and ecaf ‚Äòface‚Äô and its abbreviated
derivative eek as in How bona to vada your eek ‚ÄòHow nice to see
your face‚Äô.
226
secret language
A number of words once conÔ¨Åned to Polari have moved into
general use, including butch, mince, naff (off ), and queen. In the
nineteenth century varda ‚Äòsee, look at‚Äô passed into general slang.
‚ÄòSecret Languages‚Äô
In many languages there are special forms that are nominally
secret. Almost all of these employ some systematic means of
phonological distortion such as transposing syllables or inserting
extra syllables. These forms of language are designed to restrict
communication to an in-group and exclude others. They are
mostly used by older children and early teenagers as much for
fun as for real secrecy, and they are sometimes referred to as play
languages, but they are also used somewhat less systematically in
various non-English-based argots.17
Play languages were once
popular among young English speakers, but they have fallen
from use over the last few decades.
The best-known play language is Pig Latin, which involves
transposition. There are a number of varieties. In most of them
any consonants that precede the Ô¨Årst vowel of a word are moved to
the end of the word and are followed by -ay. If there is no such
consonant or consonant cluster‚Äîthat is, if the word begins with a
vowel‚Äîthen -way, -yay, or -ay is added at the end of the word.
Here is an example where -way is used.
I will now give you an example of Pig Latin.

Laycock 1972 coins the label ludling from Latin ludus ‚Äògame‚Äô and

jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
In a word like ‚Äòtypical‚Äô where ‚Äòy‚Äô represents a vowel, the Pig Latin
form is ypicaltay. In some versions the transpositions apply only to
content words.18
Pig Latin is used for fun or so that kids can talk in front of
outsiders (e.g. their parents or other children) without being
understood, except by each other. Outsiders are likely to cotton
on after a bit of exposure, but Pig Latin still serves to mark the

Pig Latin has been featured in a number of Ô¨Ålms and television
programmes. In the animated Ô¨Ålm The Lion King there is the
following exchange featuring Simba, the lion cub, Zazu, a horn-
bill, and Banzai, one of three threatening hyenas:
simba But, Zazu, you said they [the hyenas] are nothing but
slobbery, mangy, stupid poachers.
zazu Ixnay on the upidstay.
banzai Who you callin‚Äô ‚Äòupidstay‚Äô?
Expressions of the pattern Ixnay on the so-and-so have some cur-
rency in American English. Ixnay is the Pig Latin form of nix (from
Yiddish nichts ‚Äònothing‚Äô) and is a general negative covering ‚Äòno‚Äô,
‚Äònot‚Äô, don‚Äôt‚Äô, and ‚Äònothing‚Äô.
Transposing syllables is common in secret languages. Among
the Bantu peoples of Angola and Zambia the children have a secret
18
Movement of the Ô¨Årst syllable to the end of the word is also found in
Arepecunmakke, one of several play languages used among the Kuna of
Panama and Colombia (Sherzer 1982: 177).
osi ‚Äòpineapple‚Äô ! sio
ipya ‚Äòeye‚Äô ! yaip
228
secret language
language in which the last two syllables of a word are reversed, as in
the following Luchazi example (White 1955: 96):
Nayi nakuswinga vantsi
Yina nakungaswi ntsiva
‚ÄòShe has gone to catch Ô¨Åsh with a sweeping basket.‚Äô
The Zande of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central
African Republic, and the Sudan used a play language at court
which also involved transposing syllables, so that vuse ‚Äòbelly‚Äô
became sevu and parakondo ‚Äòegg‚Äô became rapandoko (Evans-Pritchard
1954). It was especially popular with the ‚Äòmany sons of the many
wives of a prince [who] had few duties and could devote their
leisure to pastimes‚Äô.
Teenage speakers of Pitjantjatjara in the Areyonga community in
central Australia use a special form of language among themselves,
which they call ‚Äòshort way language‚Äô. Words are formed by dropping
the initial syllable, as in the following example (Langlois 2006):
kutjara tjara ‚Äòtwo‚Äô
rapita pita ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô
pukurlarinyi kurlarinyi ‚Äòbe happy‚Äô
kuula laa ‚Äòschool‚Äô
The process is simple but the disguise effective. Consider, for
example, pita ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô, which bears no obvious resemblance to
rapita, a word borrowed from English. Similarly with kuula
‚Äòschool‚Äô, a word borrowed from English without the initial s
since Pitjantjatjara and Australian languages generally do not
have initial consonant clusters with s. In this example la is
lengthened to laa to meet the minimum requirement for a
word. In the short term the ‚Äòshort way language‚Äô is secret, though
229
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
anyone familiar with Pitjantjatjara would soon realize how it
works. The practice of dropping an initial syllable is not a
common historical development in languages, but curiously drop-
ping an initial consonant or even an initial syllable is a recurrent
feature of historical development in various parts of Australia. For
instance, the word for ‚Äòtwo‚Äô given as the Ô¨Årst example above
appears as athira or thira in some of the Arandic languages of
central Australia.19
A common principle for disguising words is to introduce new
material into each syllable. Either a vowel‚Äìconsonant sequence is
introduced before the vowel of a syllable or a consonant‚Äìvowel
sequence after the vowel. A syllable go, for instance, could have
a sequence like am introduced before the vowel to produce gamo or a
sequence ma introduced after the vowel to produce goma. Either
way consonants are separated by vowels to produce sequences that
are relatively easy to pronounce. In Eggy Peggy the sequence egg is
introduced before the vowel of each syllable. Examples can be
found in Nancy Mitford‚Äôs Love in a Cold Climate.
Don‚Äôt you dare tell the teacher.
Deggont yeggou deggare teggell thegge teggeacher.
In Javanais, a disguised form of French, the syllable av is inÔ¨Åxed
after the initial consonant or consonant cluster of the word so that
19
In Javanese, one of several play languages deletes all but the Ô¨Årst
syllable of words, but retains the initial consonant of the second syllable
(Sherzer 1982: 184).
aku arep lungo ! ak ar lung
230
secret language
beau ‚ÄòÔ¨Åne‚Äô becomes baveau, non ‚Äònot‚Äô becomes navon, and jardin
‚Äògarden‚Äô becomes javardin (Jennings 1965).
In those secret languages that insert a consonant‚Äìvowel
sequence after the vowel of each syllable, the vowel is usually an
echo of the vowel of the syllable, as in the following Japanese
example (Farb 1974: 106):
Anohito-wa sore-o watashi-ni kureru-deshoo.
Akanokohikitoko-waka sokoreke-oko wakatakashiki-niki kuk-
urekeruku-dekeshokooko.
Kuna has two secret languages of this type. In the Ô¨Årst the insertion
is pp plus a repeat of the vowel of the syllable (Sherzer 1982: 179):
pia ‚Äòwhere‚Äô ! pippiappa
perkw
aple ! pepperkw
appapleppe
In the second the inserted consonant is r:
pe ‚Äòyou‚Äô ! pere
tanikki ‚Äòhe‚Äôs coming‚Äô ! taranirikkiri
In Javanese there are secret languages using the same principle with
f and p as the inserted consonants, plus a more complicated one
where the inserted consonant is s, and this s is also used as the Ô¨Ånal
consonant of the initial syllable, replacing the Ô¨Ånal consonant
where there is one (Sherzer 1982: 184):
aku arep tuke klambi . . .
askusu asresep tuskese klasbi . . .
‚ÄòI want to buy clothes . . . ‚Äô
In some play languages a syllable is added after each word. There is
very little disguise about such systems. In the Ô¨Årst example below-na
231
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
is added, and in the second -gree is added (see, for instance,
Wentworth and Flexner 1960).
Can you keep a secret?
Canna youna keepna ana secretna?
Cangree yougree keepgree agree secretgree?
Equally unsecret are systems where something is added at the
beginning of a word. In Skimono Jive sk is said to be added before
each word, but in practice an unstressed e is often needed to
facilitate pronunciation:
I‚Äôve had a skinful and so have you.
Skive sk(e)had ska sk(e)skinful skand sk(e)so sk(e)have sk(e)you.
A little more secret is Ny≈çb≈ç kotoba, a secret language that devel-
oped in Japan among women of the court in the Muromachi era
and then spread to other women. It involves preÔ¨Åxing words with
the polite preÔ¨Åx o- and removing the Ô¨Ånal syllable of disyllabic
words or the last two syllables of longer words. The word kawame-
shi ‚Äòrice with red beans‚Äô becomes okawa. In some instances a sufÔ¨Åx
-moji is added. The word sushi, for instance, is truncated to su-,
preÔ¨Åxed by o- and sufÔ¨Åxed by -moji to produce osumoji.
Among the Lardil people of Mornington Island and the Yang-
kaal people of Forsyth Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria men were
taught a special form of ritual language called Damin when they
underwent advanced initiation. Although it was taught in the
context of initiation, it was used in the community and could be
overheard by women and children. It consisted of a small vocabu-
lary of generic words to be substituted for everyday words, so that
it is rather like the mother-in-law languages mentioned in the
232
secret language
previous chapter. However, a curious feature of Damin words is
that some contained unusual speech sounds, including a voiceless
l-sound made by sucking air in, rather like a sound we make when
someone tells us about a gruesome injury. There were also nasal-
ized clicks (Hale 1973: 401‚Äì58). As we saw on p. 187, clicks do not
occur in the normal register of any languages other than the
Khoisan languages of southern Africa and some neighbouring
Bantu languages.
People aiming to be sarcastic or ironic often say the reverse of
what you might expect, so it is not surprising to Ô¨Ånd that anto-
nymy plays a part in disguising language. Among the Hanun√≥o of
the Philippines antonymic expressions are introduced sporadically.
So, for instance, one might say da:qut qay waydiq ‚Äòvery bad indeed‚Äô
instead of mayad waydiq ‚Äòvery good‚Äô or Hayga pinabi : lug nimu
kanmu bayqun? ‚ÄòWhy did you make your basket round?‚Äô instead of
Hayga qina≈ãa : bang kanmu bayqu≈ã? ‚ÄòWhy is your basket Ô¨Çatsided?‚Äô
(Conklin 1964: 296). The Warlpiri of central Australia have a play
language based on antonymy where, for instance, ‚ÄòI go north‚Äô
becomes ‚ÄòYou go south‚Äô (Hale 1971).
Non-English-Based Argots
Argots are reported from a number of languages and generally
involve esoteric vocabulary and/or systematic distortion of words.
In a typical argot words are drawn largely from the mainstream
language of the community, but an alternative possibility is an argot
based on a minority language. About a thousand years ago Gypsies
began migrating from India across Europe, some reaching Britain
in the late Middle Ages. They had their own language, Romani,
which developed different dialects inÔ¨Çuenced by the languages of
233
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
the countries in which Gypsies found themselves. Over the centur-
ies Romani tended to be eroded and replaced by the languages of
host countries. In Britain Romani lasted until the twentieth century,
mainly in Wales, but most Gypsies came to speak Anglo-Romani,
which is essentially English interlarded with some hundreds of
Romani words so that it is like a code (Price 1984: 232‚Äì40). While
most of the distinctive Anglo-Romani vocabulary consists of old
Romani words, there are also new formations such as sasti-groi
‚Äòiron horse‚Äô for locomotive (Hancock 1984a: 378).
There was an analogous erosion of Romani in Spain, where the
language is called Cal√≥. Compare the following sentences, which
share three Romani roots (Geipel 1995: 124).
anglo-romani Let‚Äôs jal ta pee mull.
caloÃÅ Chalemos ta piyar mol.
‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go and drink wine.‚Äô
The secrecy afforded by this Romani vocabulary is fostered and
members are discouraged from revealing Romani words to non-
Gypsies.
In Ireland masons had an argot called Bearla Lagair (also Berla-
gar na saer) containing many Irish words. The masons in question
were stone workers, not Freemasons, but the way they maintained
secrecy is reminiscent of the latter (Sinclair 1909: 354).
This masons‚Äô talk is a secret language spoken only by stone-
masons, they all claim. Apprentices obtained from a master-
mason Ô¨Årst papers, second papers, and Ô¨Ånally a third paper,
called an ‚Äòindenture‚Äô, and an increase in wages with each paper.
No apprentice was entitled to his indenture until he could
speak the Bearla Lagair. They were forbidden to teach it to
234
secret language
any one not a mason, even to a member of their own family. No
stone-mason would work on any job except with members of
the order. This language identiÔ¨Åed them. They also had secret
signs, methods of handling their trowels, squares, and other
tools, ways of pointing, and laying and smoothing mortar,
which indicated a member, without a word being spoken.
There is another Irish-based argot known as Shelta, traditionally
used by itinerants in Ireland, Great Britain, and North America. It
is essentially English with a large number of distinct words, mostly
from Irish plus a few borrowed from Romani and English cant.
A few Shelta constructions have Irish syntax, such as Have you the
feen‚Äôs dorah nyocked? ‚ÄòHave you the man‚Äôs bread taken?‚Äô (Hancock
1984b, Hancock 1986). Shelta differs from Bearla Lagair in that it
incorporates several of the phonological distortions mentioned in
the previous section (Sinclair 1909: 359). For instance, the Ô¨Årst
syllable, or the only syllable of a monosyllabic word, may be
reversed so that mhac ‚Äòson‚Äô becomes cam, and cail√≠n ‚Äògirl‚Äô becomes
lackeen. Cail√≠n has come into English as a word for a young Irish
woman and as a proper name. The colloquial words bloke and
moniker come from Shelta.
We now turn to argots based on the majority language of their
communities. Lunfardo is a Spanish-based argot that sprang up
around Buenos Aires at the turn of the twentieth century,
perhaps in prisons. The word lunfardo is from non-standard
Italian lombardo and means ‚Äòcriminal‚Äô. In Lunfardo the initial
syllable of a word is moved to the end of the word, so tango
becomes got√°n and caf√© con leche ‚Äòcaf√© au lait‚Äô becomes f√©ca con
chele. Note that the function word con ‚Äòwith‚Äô is not affected.
Speakers of Lunfardo do not convert every word, they merely
235
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
intersperse their speech with ‚Äòreversals‚Äô. Lunfardo also borrows
from Italian, French, Portuguese, and the indigenous language
Guaran√≠. Secret languages similar to Lunfardo are found through-
out South America.20
Another argot in which syllables are moved is ≈†atrovaƒçki. This
originally developed among criminals in what used to be called
Yugoslavia, but has spread into more general use. It is based on
what used to be called Serbo-Croatian. Examples include the
following and show the initial syllable being moved to the end of
the word: Ganci (for Cigan) ‚ÄòGypsy‚Äô, Rijama (Marija) ‚ÄòMarija‚Äô,
Binsr (Srbin) ‚ÄòSerbian‚Äô, and Rajvosa (Sarajevo).21
The French have an argot called Verlan, which originated
among the criminal classes. It also involves moving the initial
syllable to the end of the word so that caf√© ‚Äòcoffee‚Äô becomes f√©ca,
cigarette becomes garetci (also abbreviated to garo), and Bonjour,
√ßa va? ‚ÄòGood day, how are you?‚Äô becomes Jourbon, va √ßa? In fact
the name Verlan or Verlen is derived from l‚Äôenvers ‚Äòbackwards‚Äô.
With a monosyllabic word, the initial and Ô¨Ånal consonants switch
positions, as in ouf (fou) ‚Äòmad‚Äô, sub (bus) ‚Äòbus‚Äô, and luc (cul ) ‚Äòarse‚Äô.
The ‚Äòsilent e‚Äô is used, so ‚Äòla classe‚Äô becomes la secla. As one would
expect, the spelling is not Ô¨Åxed so this word could be spelt cecla or
seucla or ceucla. This movement of syllables is only a supplement
to the argot vocabulary; for instance, one may use the slang word
mec ‚Äòbloke‚Äô or use consonant reversal to encode this word as
quem.
20
In Rio de Janeiro and S~
ao Paolo there is a Portuguese secret language
called Gualin, the name being derived from lingua ‚Äòlanguage‚Äô.
21
Examples are from the Wikipedia entry for ≈†atrovaƒçki.
236
secret language
In Louch√©bem, a French argot dating back to the butchers of
Villette in the nineteenth century, the initial consonant or con-
sonant cluster is replaced by l and moved to the end of the word
and a sufÔ¨Åx is added. The name Louch√©bem is formed from
boucher ‚Äòbutcher‚Äô by this process, using the sufÔ¨Åx -em: b-oucher >
loucher-b-em > loucherbem or Louch√©bem.
vingt ‚Äòtwenty‚Äô ! linv√©
prince ‚Äòprince‚Äô ! linspr√©
beau ‚ÄòÔ¨Åne‚Äô ! leaubiche
fou ‚Äòmad‚Äô ! loufoque
The last form on this list, loufoque, has passed into general French
slang.
A common process in French slang is to add a sufÔ¨Åx to a
truncated form of a word, as with English garb-o from garbage
collector (Guiraud 1985).
fort fortiche ‚Äòstrong‚Äô
poisson poiscal ‚ÄòÔ¨Åsh‚Äô
pernod perniÔ¨Çard ‚Äòpernod‚Äô
directeur dirlot ‚Äòdirector‚Äô
Other sufÔ¨Åxes that have become popular recently include -if
(rasoir ‚Äòrazor‚Äô ! rasif ), -ingue (sale ‚Äòdirty‚Äô ! salingue), and -aga
(pernod ! pernaga).
Sign Argot
An alternative to speech and writing is the use of hand signs. We
are all familiar with signs such as a raised palm to indicate stop, the
thumb pointing over the shoulder used in hitch-hiking, an index
Ô¨Ånger raised to pursed lips to request silence, and so on. Fully
237
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
developed sign languages include British Sign Language and
Ameslan (American Sign Language), used by the deaf, and there
are other elaborate signing systems. In some societies signs are used
in hunting or in situations where respect is required, as in mourn-
ing. These are overt systems, but secret signs are used among some
of the groups described above as users of argot. Religious commu-
nities who practise silence are reported to have signs. Documented
examples from the Middle Ages include signs for food, clothing,
religious terminology, ranks, and occupations (Bruce 2007). Most
of the signs correspond to nouns and most, if not all, have an
iconic origin. The use of signs was introduced to restrict mundane
conversation and to promote decorum and religious contempla-
tion, but, as Bruce notes, signs served as a lingua franca in
monasteries where there were monks from different language
backgrounds who were not Ô¨Çuent in Latin. The signs were not
known to outsiders and thus served to maintain a sense of solidar-
ity (Bruce 2007: 79, 96).
One deliberate method of secret signs used in the Renaissance
was to touch parts of the body to spell out a word. Various body
parts were associated with letters of the alphabet by their initials, so
the system was essentially a substitution cipher. To signal Fuge!
‚ÄòFlee‚Äô one would touch in succession the forehead ( frons), the
stomach (uenter), the knee (genu) or throat (guttur), and the
epiglottis (epiglossa) (Shumaker 1982: 108). This sounds straight-
forward, but distinguishing the throat and epiglottis under condi-
tions requiring secrecy would have been tricky.
Another system involving touching parts of the body is the
traditional system of hand signals known as tic-tac, which was
used to transmit betting odds. In Britain it was used by employees
238
secret language
of bookmakers to convey prices over a distance‚Äîfor instance, from
the main betting ring to the minor ones. In Australia it is illegal, but
was once used to signal odds to the cheaper enclosures or to illegal
bookmakers outside the course. To indicate odds of 9/4, for in-
stance, the hands touch the head. To indicate 10/1 the Ô¨Åsts are held
in front of the body, in some variants with the right thumb raised,
the idea being that this gives a rough approximation to the Ô¨Ågure 10.
In Britain the argot for odds consists of some rhyming slang such as
Burlington Bertie or scruffy and dirty (100/30), some back slang, for
instance net (10/1) and rouf (4/1), plus a number of terms related to
the tic-tac signals. For example, 5/4 is a wrist because the tic-tac
signal is to place the right hand on the left wrist and 6/4 is an ear‚Äôole
because the tic-tac signal is to raise the right hand to the left ear. Tic-
tac has been rendered practically obsolete by the proliferation of
mobile phones.
Internet Argot
The invention of the internet has given rise to an extensive argot
among those communicating by email, instant messaging, and
other social media. There are a number of rebus-type substitutions
for syllables such as B4 ‚Äòbefore‚Äô, C ‚Äòsee‚Äô, M8 ‚Äòmate, U ‚Äòyou‚Äô,
abbreviations such as LOL ‚Äòlaughing out loud‚Äô, and emoticons
such as :-) for ‚Äòsmile‚Äô and :-( for ‚Äòsad‚Äô (if they are not transparent,
turn them 90 degrees clockwise). Similar abbreviations are used in
texting by mobile phone.
Leet or Leetspeak is an internet argot involving deliberate
misspellings such as teh for ‚Äòthe‚Äô (which requires auto-correct to
be switched off), and substituting numerals and other keyboard
characters for some letters. Leet, for instance, can be written 1337
239
jargon, slang, argot, and ‚Äòsecret languages‚Äô
with Ô¨Ågures for letters, and ‚Äòporn(ography)‚Äô can be misspelt as pron
or as pron with o for o. The word Leet comes from elite and
originally referred to an in-group of hackers who shared access to
material such as pirated software and instructions on how to
manufacture drugs and explosives.
Inserting non-alphabetic characters into words is not conÔ¨Åned
to Leet users. It is used by anyone trying to bypass a security Ô¨Ålter
designed to stop the Ô¨Çow of junkmail and Spam. Internet advert-
isements for Viagra are often irregular in their spelling. This kind
of substitution is also used as gimmick in advertising. For example,
singer Marilyn Manson, who takes his name from Marilyn Mon-
roe and Charles Manson, spells his name MAR1LYN MAN50N
on the cover of Mechanical Animals.
There is some distinctive morphology in Leet. The sufÔ¨Åc -xor
(also -xxor and -zor) is used in place of -er to form agent nouns, so
that ‚Äòhacker‚Äô can be spelt haxxor. Curiously these derived nouns
can be used as verbs as in U have been haxxored ‚ÄòYou have been
hacked (into)‚Äô or That suxorz for ‚ÄòThat sucks‚Äô.
Leet also features a kind of rebus in the use of & ‚Äòampersand‚Äô as
a substitute for -and or -anned as in S& ‚Äòsand‚Äô and B& ‚Äòband‚Äô or
‚Äòbanned‚Äô.
Computer jargon is prominent in internet argot, but there are
also a few non-English words such as German ist ‚Äòis‚Äô, Krieg ‚Äòwar‚Äô,
and √ºber ‚Äòover‚Äô. This last is now in general use and is employed in
compound adjectives such as √ºbergood ‚Äòvery good‚Äô or as a stand-
alone superlative U R uber (the umlaut is optional) ‚ÄòYou are great‚Äô.

THE EVERYDAY OBLIQUE
My English text is chaste, and all licentious passages
are left in the decent obscurity of a learned language.
GIBBON, AUTOBIOGRAPHY
K
nowledge of grammar and lexicon is not sufÔ¨Åcient for
successful communication in a language. For various
reasons people do not always speak plainly and directly.
Requests or criticisms may be phrased indirectly out of politeness,
and the wish to avoid giving offence may lead people to refrain
from using certain types of language. In other contexts people
express themselves obliquely to protect their dignity or feelings.
Would-be lovers often broach the subject of a liaison indirectly to
gauge the likelihood of success, rather than risking the embarrass-
ment of refusal. People also indulge in indirect strategies for fun.
They are sometimes deliberately obscure as a way of teasing, or
they say the opposite of what is expected because they are being
ironic, sarcastic, or playfully abusive.
241
In some societies various indirect modes of discourse are highly
favoured. Among the Kiriwana of the Trobriand Islands, for
instance, oblique speech is the norm and direct expression of
criticism or difference of opinion is avoided. Tropes such as
metaphor, metonymy, analogy, and litotes are used, especially in
political debate and romantic overtures (Weiner 1984: 176‚Äì7).
Some sub-Saharan African cultures also prefer elaborate circumlo-
cution to simple, plain speech. Peek (1981: 23) writes, ‚ÄòBrevity of
speech also tends to be poorly regarded. While we are enjoined to
get to the point, such quick and direct speech is often the sign of
a poor speaker in Africa‚Äô. He also notes that, ‚ÄòIn settling disputes,
the Limba stress the importance of going round for long in
parables in order to cool the hearts of those involved and re-
establish social harmony‚Äô. Elinor Keenan (1974: 140‚Äì1) has similar
things to say about the Malagasy:
To speak indirectly is to speak with skill. Men and women alike
consider indirect speech to be more difÔ¨Åcult to produce than
direct speech. Most villagers can tell you that one who speaks
well manolana teny (twists words). In kabary [formal style], a
good speechmaker miolaka (winds in and out). The meaning of
the utterance becomes clear gradually as the speaker alludes to
the intent in a number of ways.
Phrases such as ‚Äòtwist words‚Äô and ‚Äòwind in and out‚Äô seem deroga-
tory to us, as we strongly disfavour long-windedness in most
situations. However, while we eschew ‚Äòlong-term‚Äô indirectness,
we use various ‚Äòshort-term‚Äô forms that are indirect or obscure. By
‚Äòshort-term‚Äô I mean conÔ¨Åned to the word, phrase, or sentence.
Some of these means are described in the following sections and
include euphemism, sarcasm, and irony.
242
secret language
Among the Hanun√≥o of the Philippines there are several tech-
niques for secret forms of language of the type illustrated in the
previous chapter.1
These are learnt by children, but are mostly used
in courting, especially when young men serenade young women
and visit them by night. A valued suitor must have a number of
social skills including the ability to play the musical instruments
used in serenading, to commit to memory a large repertoire of
verses, and to ‚Äòmaster the art of facile, rapid conversation, in which
the highest value is placed on the most indirect method of state-
ment‚Äô (Conklin 1964: 297). Among the Hanun√≥o, and more
generally in the Philippines, riddles are also used in erotic overtures
(Burns 1976: 143), a practice also reported from the EÔ¨Åk in Nigeria
(Simmons 1958: 124).
Among the Wana of central Sulawesi in Indonesia a two-line
verse form called kiyori is used, mostly by men, for a variety of
purposes ranging from compliments to expression of political
attitudes. Typical kiyori verses are oblique. They are full of
metaphor and cultural references. As Atkinson writes (1984: 60),
‚ÄòAmbiguity is a premium in kiyori use because it serves as a means
to avoid opposition and conÔ¨Çict, while at the same time conveying
an impression of cleverness and profound insight‚Äô. A kiyori poem
1
These techniques include transposing the consonant and vowel of the
initial syllable with the consonant and vowel of the Ô¨Ånal syllable, as in
balaynun ‚Äòdomesticated‚Äô, which becomes nulayban, or adding a preÔ¨Åx qay-
to forms of each word reduced to just consonant-vowel-consonant, so that
bu:Àõa becomes qaybuÀõ. Another is to add a sufÔ¨Åx to just the Ô¨Årst conson-
ant and vowel of each word, so that rignuk ‚Äòtame‚Äô becomes rinsiÀõ or
rinsuwayb, and qusah ‚Äòone‚Äô becomes qunsiÀõ or qunsuwayb. Note the sufÔ¨Åx
supplies a coda to the Ô¨Årst syllable (Conklin 1964: 295).
243
the everyday oblique
consists of two lines and the vowel pattern of the Ô¨Ånal two
syllables in each half-line must be the same. The following
example is oblique not only in expression, but also in that the
man presenting it attributes it to a dead aunt who gave him the
poem in a dream. When the woman was near death her husband
had, under pressure from the government, considered giving up
the traditional Wana religion in favour of Islam or Christianity.
The aunt is saying that she nearly missed out on the traditional
Wana funeral. The Ô¨Årst half-line may refer to the grave or to a
mainstream religion. Jampu kamumu is the invisibility between
earth and heaven. The last line refers to the path of mythical
heroes (Atkinson 1984: 55).
Yowu da rapsinjuyu The hole that is to be shared.
liu ri jampu kamumu Passing beyond the purple veil of
invisibility
sangkodi taamo kululu I almost no longer followed
jaya ri wali ngkatuntu the path of the magical story.
Politeness and the Like
When we want to make a request or pass criticism, we often
express ourselves obliquely out of diplomacy. Requests may be
phrased as statements or questions. Comments such as ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a bit
stuffy in here‚Äô or ‚ÄòThose bushes along the drive could do with a bit
of clipping back‚Äô are meant to prompt action on the part of an
addressee or to indicate that the speaker is about to take action.
According to Keenan (1974: 136) it is common among the Mala-
gasy for requests to be made indirectly in the form of a statement
from which listeners are expected to infer a request:
244
secret language
Young boys suddenly speak of a journey to be made that
evening and describe the blackness of the night and their lack
of candles. Women will chatter about the poor quality of
Malagasy soap in relation to European soap in my presence.
Men will moan over the shortage of funds for a particular
project. The host or listener is expected to pick up these cues
and satisfy the request.
These examples have parallels in our society. A non-driver about to
leave an evening social gathering might ask if anyone is going in his or
her direction in the hope of ‚Äòbotting a lift‚Äô, or might ask the host what
time the local bus goes in the hope that the host will arrange a lift.
An indirect stratagem for making requests is to involve a third
party as a kind of catalyst. A woman with a pram on a bus might
want someone to help her in getting off. There is a big man nearby
and a not-so-big woman. Shy about asking the man, she asks the
woman to help her, hoping the man will overhear and offer to
assist.
Direct criticism can be avoided in various ways. Someone who
habitually leaves coffee stains, used teabags, or unwashed cups
around the sink in the staff room is likely to hear the comment,
‚ÄòSome people clean up after they‚Äôve had a drink‚Äô addressed to no
one in particular. Couples often express criticism of one another by
using someone or some people as the agent. For instance, he says,
‚ÄòWe are out of sugar‚Äô and she replies, ‚ÄòSomeone must have forgot-
ten to put it on the shopping list‚Äô. These vague agents are also used
in talking to a third party. Suppose I am talking to a couple and I
Ô¨Ånd they are moving to another city and I ask why. One of them
replies, ‚ÄòSome people want to be near their relatives‚Äô. Vague agents
are fairly standard in addressing children or commenting on their
245
the everyday oblique
behaviour to a third party: ‚ÄòSomeone‚Äôs wet their nappy, haven‚Äôt
they?‚Äô, ‚ÄòSomeone‚Äôs showing off ‚Äô. Criticism is often made to an
uncomprehending third party such as a baby or a pet in the
presence of the real addressee: ‚ÄòSomeone we know got out of the
wrong side of the bed, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äô
Another possibility is to ask questions such as, ‚ÄòHow did that
door manage to come open?‚Äô or pseudo-questions such as ‚ÄòI
wonder how this dirty glass got here‚Äô. A third option is to be
disingenuous. Suppose you Ô¨Ånd your partner has swept fallen
leaves over your pansies; rather than upbraid the culprit you
remark, ‚ÄòThe wind must have blown those leaves onto the garden‚Äô.
Humour and word play provide a further strategy for avoiding
conÔ¨Çict. Malapropisms may be used for lighthearted effect, as in ‚ÄòI
hope you‚Äôre not casting nasturtiums‚Äô for ‚ÄòI hope you‚Äôre not casting
aspersions‚Äô. Deliberate mispronunciations such as ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs obvi-
vious‚Äô for ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs obvious‚Äô may serve a similar purpose.
Deliberate Obscurity
Languages often contain idiomatic expressions that appear to make
little or no sense, such as ‚ÄòIt runs in the family like wooden legs‚Äô or
‚ÄòBoys will be boys‚Äô. Proverbs are not always transparent, and in
English we often quote only part of them, as in ‚Äòpots and kettles‚Äô or
‚Äòtoo many cooks‚Äô, which adds a layer of obscurity. Learning a
language involves learning a stock of such expressions and how
they are used. It also entails mastering obscure indirect expressions
that involve an implication on the part of the speaker and require
an inference from the addressee. For instance, if someone takes up
a position where they block your view, you might use an old
246
secret language
expression (recorded in Grose 1811), ‚ÄòIs your father a glazier?‚Äô This
was quite obscure to me as a child. It implies that the addressee
thinks he or she is made of glass and is see-through. Another old
expression that is still current is ‚ÄòWere you born in a barn?‚Äô,
generally addressed to someone who has failed to close a door.
Rhetorical questions of this kind are common in lieu of greet-
ings. In the days when men were expected to have short hair, a
man or boy with longer than average hair would often be greeted
with, ‚ÄòWhen are you going to get your violin?‚Äô because long hair
was associated with musicians and artists. (In ‚ÄòPortrait of a Lady‚Äô
T.S. Eliot writes about going ‚Äòto hear the latest Pole / transmit the
Preludes, through his hair and Ô¨Ångertips‚Äô.) An indirect expression
that has survived the years is to ask a man wearing a bandage,
‚ÄòHow‚Äôs the other guy?‚Äô Here are some other examples. The exact
phrasing varies, but these are standard themes.
‚Ä¢ A woman appears with a cut or abrasions: ‚ÄòHas your husband
been beating you again?‚Äô
‚Ä¢ Someone seems more expensively dressed than usual: ‚ÄòDid you
win the lottery?‚Äô
‚Ä¢ Someone turns up in an outÔ¨Åt you think looks cheap: ‚ÄòAre the
Salvos [Salvation Army] having a sale?‚Äô
Some speakers go out of their way not to be understood. A good
example occurs in Ian Rankin‚Äôs novel Black and Blue (1997: 28).
Hard-bitten detective Rebus is confronted by a television reporter
with a camera who is keen to record a statement about an ongoing
case. Rebus says to the reporter, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôll think you‚Äôre in childbirth‚Äô.
‚ÄòSorry?‚Äô queries the confused reporter, to which Rebus replies,
‚ÄòWhen the surgeons are taking that camera out of your arse‚Äô.
247
the everyday oblique
A number of reports from Nigeria mention the use of proverb-
like riddles as a form of greeting (e.g. Simmons 1958: 124 on
the EÔ¨Åk). The following example is from the Anang (Messenger
1960: 226). One young man greets another thus:
A single vine does not Ô¨Åll a forest.
And the other replies:
A single coin falls without a sound [no jingling].
These utterances are two parts of a standard proverb-type riddle.
Messenger reports having heard this exchange in a context where it
referred obliquely to an event of a few days before where one of the
young men had argued unsuccessfully before the elders against a
decision by the village head to place him on the tax roll. The basic
notion is that one is ineffectual on one‚Äôs own against many.
In some situations indirect language is practically obligatory. If a
referee at a football match fails to award a penalty you think your
side deserves, you might shout, ‚ÄòDid you swallow your whistle?‚Äô
Similarly a jockey who makes his run too late on the favourite
might be heckled with remarks such as, ‚ÄòDo your sleeping at
home‚Äô. It would be unthinkable for people in the crowd to ask,
‚ÄòWhy did you make your run so late?‚Äô, though entirely appropriate
for an owner or trainer.
Another form of oblique speech is understatement. It is prob-
ably more common in English than in many other European
languages and also more prevalent in older people, and, in my
opinion, among men. The male role model in Ô¨Ålms, the Holly-
wood hero, is certainly laconic. Suppose I set my friend Harry
up with a date who has Ô¨Ålm-star looks and a sparkling personality.
248
secret language
I ask him what he thinks of her. He is most unlikely to say, ‚ÄòI think
she‚Äôs wonderful‚Äô, partly because that would be stating the obvious
and partly because it wouldn‚Äôt be sophisticated or ‚Äòcool‚Äô. He is
more likely to say something like, ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs all right‚Äô, ‚ÄòShe‚Äôll do‚Äô, or
even, ‚ÄòCould do worse, I suppose‚Äô.
Humour
Obscurity plays an obvious part in jokes involving riddles and silly
questions: ‚ÄòWhat do you get if you cross Big Ben with the Leaning
Tower of Pisa?‚Äô (the time and the inclination) or ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the
difference between ignorance and apathy?‚Äô (I don‚Äôt know and I
don‚Äôt care). In fact almost all verbal humour involves double
meaning in the form of either a pun or a structural ambiguity.
Typically a situation is contrived in which one interpretation Ô¨Åts
the context but another, funnier one is also possible. Consider a
conversation about the problems of marriage where one speaker
remarks, ‚ÄòMonogamy leaves a lot to be desired‚Äô. This can be taken
to mean that the institution of marriage is unsatisfactory, but there
is a ‚Äòsmart‚Äô interpretation, namely that having just one partner
leaves a lot of other persons to be lusted after.
It is a feature of language that phrases and sentences can be
ambiguous. On the basis of a dictionary sample I estimate that
English provides about four thousand pairs of words that sound
the same (homophones) and four thousand examples of words
with clear multiple meanings (polysemy). An individual speaker
will know some thousands of proper names not in the dictionary,
so we can think of an average speaker having about ten thousand
possibilities of punning. On top of this a language like English
249
the everyday oblique
provides scope for structural ambiguity since there are very few
grammatical sufÔ¨Åxes. A sentence like Driving across the plains the
zebras made a strange sight relies on common sense rather than
grammatical afÔ¨Åxes to determine the intended meaning.
Indirect or allusive references are common in humour when (as
is so often the case) it comes to sex. This is partly to reduce possible
offence and make a joke acceptable to a wider audience, and partly
to enhance the humour. Oblique references to sex often possess a
cleverness that would be missing from direct reference. Faced with
a threat to his brain Woody Allen cries, ‚ÄòOh, no, not my brain.
That‚Äôs my second favourite organ‚Äô. Someone says that sex isn‚Äôt
dirty. Woody replies, ‚ÄòIt is when you‚Äôre doing it right‚Äô.
Euphemism
Chapter 7 showed that some topics and some particular words are
subject to taboo in various societies. Some words are taboo because
their use might antagonize a spirit or some other supernatural
being, or because speakers have such respect for a god or monarch
that they do not want the name profaned. More often words
become taboo because of properties of the referent. Words for
excrement and other bodily efÔ¨Çuvia fall into this category. Taboo
leads to avoidance of certain topics or the use of euphemisms, a
phenomenon that is probably universal (Brown and Levinson
1987: 216; Allan and Burridge 1991: vii). Euphemism is literally
‚Äòspeaking well‚Äô and it involves replacing a word or expression with
an alternative.
Not all euphemism is an attempt to avoid a taboo; some
euphemisms, particularly those found in advertising, are a way of
250
secret language
presenting something in a favourable light.2
Consider the term life
insurance. It is really death insurance, but it sounds more positive
to call it insurance that stretches over the course of one‚Äôs life, rather
than insurance that is paid out on one‚Äôs death. As I write this, I Ô¨Çip
through the real estate magazine from my local paper. Average
suburban ‚Äòhomes‚Äô are ‚Äòtreasured gems in brilliant locations‚Äô with
‚Äòinspired Ô¨Çoor plans‚Äô and ‚Äògrand proportions‚Äô. All are ‚Äòimmacu-
lately presented‚Äô. Housing estates in parched paddocks on the
fringes of the city are given names such as Fountain Lakes, Caroline
Springs, and Water Gardens. A feature of euphemism is the substi-
tution of big words or phrases for simple ones, as with negative
outcome for failure and negative outcome potential for risk. The
military have a number of technical-sounding expressions that
cloak death and destruction. Successful bombing has been de-
scribed as paciÔ¨Åcation of the enemy infrastructure. Here it is not
only paciÔ¨Åcation that is a euphemism, but infrastructure also.
Taboo and euphemism entail an extra layer of difÔ¨Åculty for the
language learner, because in areas subject to taboo words fre-
quently change their status and there is frequent replacement.
Race is an area where replacement is common; even the term
race itself tends to be replaced by ethnicity. The noun native has
fallen out of fashion, along with terms such as picaninny for ‚Äònative
child‚Äô and squaw and analogous terms for ‚Äònative woman‚Äô. In
Australia the native people of the nineteenth century became the
Aboriginal people of the twentieth century and are currently
Indigenous. In the United States people of African descent were
2
I do not propose to deal with this area in detail as it has been well
covered in several books, e.g. Allan and Burridge 1991 and 2006.
251
the everyday oblique
referred to as Negroes until the middle of the twentieth century,
and then acquired a succession of ofÔ¨Åcial names such as Afro-
Americans and the current African Americans. Coloured people
have become people of colour.
An area where taboo is common and some kind of avoidance is
probably universal is death. Although in English there is no
proscription on using the words to die and death, we tend to use
euphemisms such as to pass away, pass on, or go to rest or religious
euphemisms that assume an afterlife: met his/her maker, passed over,
gone upstairs, gathered to his/her ancestors. As can be seen from this
example, taboo can lead to a proliferation of euphemisms. Crimi-
nals rarely speak of killing someone; they have people rubbed out
and wasted. Governments have their enemies taken out or termin-
ated. Until recently one talked of having an animal put down, that
is, ‚Äòkilled‚Äô, but now the term euthanized is taking its place.
In all societies there are restrictions on reference to sex and
bodily functions, though the nature of the restrictions varies a lot
from one culture to another. The strength and scope of a taboo can
vary over time. To speakers of contemporary English it comes as a
surprise to Ô¨Ånd the mildly vulgar word piss in the Authorized
Version of the Bible (1611): Hath he not sent me to the men which
sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own
piss with you? (2 Kings 18:27). This word was once respectable, but
suffered derogation from association with its referent, though it
lives on as a respectable term in the abbreviation pee.
In western culture a number of strategies are used in avoiding
direct reference to sex and bodily functions. The complete avoid-
ance strategy is illustrated by someone at a social gathering enquir-
ing about the location of a toilet by asking, ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs the . . . ?‚Äô,
252
secret language
leaving the question unÔ¨Ånished. While this is a trivial example, it is
alarming to recall that up until a generation or so ago even
‚Äòdoctor‚Äôs books‚Äô were incomplete with respect to the uro-genital
system and its functions and some showed pictures of naked
humans with the genitals omitted.
Something akin to complete avoidance can be found in expres-
sions for the pubic area such as down there and her you-know-what,
and expressions for nakedness such as in the altogether and as God
made her/him.3
There is similar avoidance in to expose oneself
(compare ‚ÄòHe exposed himself to public criticism‚Äô), to interfere
with (an under-age person), doing it, doing the deed (having sexual
intercourse), and getting a bit (of sex). Other euphemistic devices
include vagueness (plumbing, waterworks), phonetic alteration
(shit ! shite, shute), use of a synonym including one borrowed
from another dialect or language (Latin faeces), an archaism (swive),
a nursery word (wee-wees), an abbreviation (BO for body odour), or a
periphrasis (passing water).
Pregnancy was subject to taboo a few generations ago and there
were a number of substitutes for ‚Äòpregnant‚Äô such as to be in the
family way, to be in a delicate condition, and to be expecting, the last
one still being current. Menstruation was under a strong taboo
until recently and still cannot be spoken of directly in many
situations. The same applies to menopause. In the Bible when
Abraham‚Äôs wife, Sarah, hears a prophecy that she is going to have a
son, she laughs, because, as the Authorized Version delicately puts
3
A naked person is also said to be in his/her birthday suit. For years this
struck me as strange since in my experience people did not disrobe on
their birthday, but of course the reference is to birthday in its literal sense
not in the more common sense of ‚Äòanniversary of one‚Äôs birth‚Äô.
253
the everyday oblique
it, ‚ÄòAbraham and Sarah were old and well stricken with age, and it
had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women‚Äô (Genesis
18:11).
The taboo nature of certain word forms can lead to their
avoidance even when they carry different meanings. The word
ejaculation was in common use until the mid-twentieth century for
‚Äòa brief, exclamatory utterance‚Äô. Up till then ejaculation in the
physical sense was not mentioned in polite conversation and never
in the media, but as the taboo relaxed and references to ejaculation
of semen became possible, the linguistic ejaculation fell into disuse.
Much the same happened with erection in the sense of structure,
which was common enough until erection of the penis became
mentionable. A similar phenomenon can be observed with words
that sound similar to taboo words. Mensuration was a standard
term when I was in primary school, but as menstruation became
mentionable, mensuration disappeared. Other words which
are avoided because they resemble taboo words include rection
(erection), regina, as in ‚ÄòVictoria Regina‚Äô and ‚ÄòElizabeth Regina‚Äô
(vagina), masticate (masturbate), and tampion (tampon). Admittedly
there is not much cause for most of us, who don‚Äôt own a riÔ¨Çe, to
use tampion, but there are people who hesitate to mention a certain
city in Florida that bears a similar name.4
Squeamishness about using certain expressions can interfere
with the Ô¨Çow of information. As is well known from attempts
to ban books such as Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover as late as 1960,
4
Fryer (1964: 85) gives a number of other examples, including circum-
scribe (circumcise), privet (privy), sects (sex), titter (tits), and vowels
(bowels).
254
secret language
censorship of explicit sexual material was the norm until fairly
recently. Reference books such as encyclopaedias often omitted
mention of sexual functions and activities, and sexually transmis-
sible diseases, while dictionaries omitted certain words altogether
or replaced certain letters of taboo words with asterisks. In
Grose‚Äôs Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1785/1811) the following
entry can be found:
C**
T. The √• of the Greek, and the cunnus of the Latin
dictionaries; a nasty name for a nasty thing: un con Miege.
A number of entries in Grose‚Äôs dictionary refer to the vulva/vagina.
One such is bottomless pit, which is deÔ¨Åned as ‚Äòthe monosyllable‚Äô.
The entry for monosyllable is ‚Äòa woman‚Äôs commodity‚Äô.
The entry quoted above also illustrates another feature of
euphemism, namely the use of foreign languages, in this case
Greek, Latin, and French. Anthropological works of yesteryear
often described sexual matters in Latin, and Latin is still used in
some quarters as a source of euphemism. I notice that the list of
ingredients of some beauty products includes aqua, and a
woman told me that a doctor described her baby‚Äôs birthmark
as a naevus. A man interviewed on television recounted that he
went to the doctor with what he called an ‚Äòitchy arse‚Äô. The
doctor examined him and said that he had pruritus ani. As the
interviewee commented, this was vacuous. All the doctor had
done was give the Latin name for what he knew he had in the
Ô¨Årst place.5
5
The practice of doctors‚Äô use of obscure Latin in front of patients is
lampooned in Moli√®re‚Äôs Le Malade imaginaire (1673).
255
the everyday oblique
Until a generation or so ago it was normal practice to refer to
physical and mental shortcomings directly, and, as we saw in the
section on slang, there was an extensive vocabulary to describe
these perceived deÔ¨Åciencies. Recently ofÔ¨Åcial parlance has intro-
duced euphemisms for these conditions. A person who would have
been described as handicapped came to be described as disabled
and, more recently, differently abled. School children at the lower
end of the ability spectrum were sometimes called special children,
a particularly confusing euphemism. Some euphemisms, such as
vertically challenged for ‚Äòshort‚Äô and socially challenged for a recluse,
seem to backÔ¨Åre. People often use them jokingly and sometimes
confusion arises as to whether a term is being used seriously or
humorously, or even whether it is a parody rather than a genuine
example.
Euphemism and various forms of indirection play a part in
negotiation. When the fraud squad or the tax inspectors call, the
person under investigation might mention that he has had a tip
on a horse running on the following Saturday and that he will put
something on for the investigators. He can‚Äôt name the horse. If
word got around, the price would tumble. The unspeciÔ¨Åed horse
invariably wins and on his next visit the authorities are offered
their share of the winnings. Sexual advances are often made
obliquely, sometimes with compliments about physical appear-
ance or assumed properties, sometimes by working expressions
such as It needs a screw or I could do with a stiff one into the
conversation to see if the other party picks up on a sexual
insinuation.
A curious example of something akin to euphemism can be
found in the way betting information in Australia is given over the
256
secret language
radio or television. It has always been illegal to disseminate betting
information from a licensed venue such as a racecourse, although it
is becoming difÔ¨Åcult to maintain this restriction with the avail-
ability of mobile phones. However, no radio broadcaster has been
charged over relaying odds using terms such as the following:
1/1 ‚ÄòÔ¨Çip of the coin odds‚Äô or ‚Äòone of theirs for one of yours‚Äô
4/1 ‚Äòeach-way odds‚Äô
8/1 ‚Äòdouble each-way odds‚Äô
10/1 ‚Äòdouble-Ô¨Ågure odds‚Äô or ‚Äòjust into double Ô¨Ågures‚Äô
These terms can be supplemented by addition and subtraction so
that 3/1 is ‚Äòa point under each-way odds‚Äô and 5/1 is a ‚Äòa point over
each-way odds‚Äô. Although a broadcaster would be penalized for
using Ô¨Ågures, descriptive phrases that carry the same information
have never incurred a penalty.
Abusive Language
Another form of indirect language is to use nominally abusive
language to a friend. It is pretty much standard for males to say
‚ÄòYou silly bugger‚Äô or ‚ÄòYou mean bastard‚Äô to one another without
being offensive, or even use ‚Äòsonuvabitch‚Äô, which theoretically is
maximally offensive but is weakened by convention, a weakening
that is captured in the spelling. Consider the following dialogue
overheard at the bar (‚Äòthe nineteenth hole‚Äô) of a country golf links
when one man‚Äîwe‚Äôll call him Tom‚Äîspots a friend, whom we‚Äôll
call Bill. Bill is a grim, unsmiling man who would pass for a
gangster in a Humphrey Bogart Ô¨Ålm. When we consider the
whole exchange, we can see that they are friends, but you wouldn‚Äôt
know it from Bill‚Äôs Ô¨Årst two turns.
257
the everyday oblique
Tom Hey, Bill!
Bill People you meet when you haven‚Äôt got a gun.
Tom I thought I might see you here.
Bill What are you doing here? Are the pubs fuckin‚Äô closed?
Tom I just thought I‚Äôd get a bit of exercise for a change.
Bill Come on. I‚Äôll buy you a beer.
Abusive exchanges are used by Turkish boys from around the
age of eight to the age of fourteen. The exchange begins with an
insult such as calling someone the equivalent of English prick or
claiming they play a passive role in homosexual sex. It may escalate
to alleging prodigious promiscuity on the part of the other boy‚Äôs
mother or sisters or threatening to split him, his mother, or his
sisters with one‚Äôs giant penis. These threats and allegations are not
to be taken literally, though they are meant to be insulting and
provocative. A boy who suffers such a verbal assault is expected to
reply with a rhyming line (Dundes, Leach, and √ñzk√∂k 1972), and
this can lead to an exchange of rhyming banter, although there is
also the danger that the taunts can lead to violence (Glazer 1976:
88). In the Ô¨Årst example below A calls B a bear. This is not a
sexually oriented insult, but a bear is considered a big, clumsy,
stupid animal, and B replies ‚ÄòMay a violin bow enter your anus‚Äô,
the violin bow being notable for its length and the fact it is moved
back and forth.
A. Ayi
bear
B. San-a girsin keman yayi
you-to enter violin bow
‚ÄòMay a violin bow go up you.‚Äô
258
secret language
In the second example A calls B a cucumber, a cucumber being a
traditional insult because of its phallic shape. B suggests where the
cucumber might be placed.
A. Hiyar
cucumber
B. G√∂t-√ºn-e uyar
arse-your-to Ô¨Åt
‚ÄòIt Ô¨Åts your arse.‚Äô
Some insults have conventional rhyming replies, but Turkish
youths are expected to be able to extemporize and carry on duels
with a series of exchanges.
Among African-American males nearing the age of puberty and
in early teens there is a tradition of trading insults largely aimed at
one‚Äôs opponent‚Äôs mother. This is known as ‚Äòplaying‚Äô or ‚Äòsounding‚Äô,
and is also referred to in the literature as ‚Äòthe dozens‚Äô or ‚Äòplaying
the dozens‚Äô. Typical assertions are that the speaker has had sex with
his adversary‚Äôs mother, as in the Ô¨Årst example below, or that the
mother is promiscuous, as in the other examples (Abrahams 1962).
I fucked your mother in a horse and wagon
She said, ‚ÄòScuse me, mister, my pussy‚Äôs draggin‚Äô.
At least my mother ain‚Äôt no cake, everybody get a piece.
At least my mother ain‚Äôt no doorknob, everybody gets a turn.
Your mother‚Äôs like a railroad track, laid all over the country.
Other themes are the obesity, age, stupidity, or ugliness of the
other boy‚Äôs mother. These have developed into a genre of humor-
ous abuse circulated via books and Web sites.
Among Australian Aborigines obscene banter is expected
behaviour between certain kin, most often between grandparent
259
the everyday oblique
and grandchild of the same sex. The banter often involves jibes
about alleged deÔ¨Åciencies in the genital area (Thomson 1935;
Haviland 1979a, b; McConvell 1982).
Speaking in Opposites
A number of idiomatic expressions have a meaning that is more or
less the opposite of their literal meaning. Consider, for instance,
‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt say so!‚Äô and ‚ÄòYou can say that again‚Äô. Idioms apart, there
are common strategies for interaction that involve saying exactly
the opposite of what we mean. Suppose you ask me to nominate
who will win Wimbledon and my selection is eliminated in the
Ô¨Årst round. You might say to me, ‚ÄòWhat a great judge you turned
out to be!‚Äô Obviously you are criticizing my poor judgement in this
instance and the context makes that clear. This is an example of
sarcasm‚Äîsaying the opposite of what you mean in an attempt to
mock. To appreciate how this works consider the possibility of
making a direct statement such as ‚ÄòYour favourite didn‚Äôt do very
well‚Äô. This is to state the obvious. You can‚Äôt do that without
appearing na√Øve, but you can quite reasonably use sarcasm. It is
conventional to do so and therefore not particularly offensive.
Examples of what I am calling sarcasm are often referred to as
irony (see, for example, Brown and Levinson 1987: 221‚Äì2). Irony is
used in a number of senses. Some would say it is ironical if the
inventor of the guillotine is the Ô¨Årst person to be executed by it. In
Ô¨Åctional contexts irony involves a character being unaware of
something that is obvious to another character in a story or to
the audience. This is sometimes called dramatic irony. The story
of King Oedipus provides a classic example. Oedipus hears a
260
secret language
prophecy that he is destined to kill his father and marry his
mother, so he leaves the people he believes to be his parents and
goes to another kingdom. However, he does not realize that he has
been reared apart from his real parents and, in an attempt to avoid
his fate, enters his parents‚Äô kingdom and fulÔ¨Åls the prophecy.
The contrast between ignorance and knowledge is the essential
feature of irony. If we apply the notion to verbal irony, then irony
is accidental, whereas sarcasm is deliberate. An example I remem-
ber from my student days is of a man who was criticized for his
accent, particularly for pronouncing Ô¨Åne as ‚Äòfoine‚Äô. He replied
indignantly, ‚ÄòOi never say foine‚Äô. But he repeated the alleged
error in his pronunciation of the diphthong in ‚ÄòI‚Äô, thus giving
the lie to his protestation of innocence. There is also the story of a
bishop who told his Ô¨Çock, ‚ÄòIn the eyes of God we are all equal from
me right down to the lowest of you‚Äô. Many malapropisms involve
irony in that the speaker says something he or she didn‚Äôt intend. In
a Miss World contest the competitors had to say one line about
their home country. The US contestant described her country as
the land of ‚Äòopportunism‚Äô.
In practice irony is used in a way that overlaps with sarcasm,
and this is understandable when one considers that there is a
continuum from outright sneering to a kind of conventional use
of opposites not directed at anyone in particular. If someone
clumsily drops the dinner plates and they smash, you might say,
‚ÄòCongratulations!‚Äô If you hear that the airline staff have walked off
the job just when you are about to Ô¨Çy off for a holiday in the
Bahamas, you might exclaim, ‚ÄòLovely!‚Äô The former is directed
against the perpetrator and probably qualiÔ¨Åes as sarcasm; the latter
is an expression of dismay not aimed directly at the perpetrators. It
261
the everyday oblique
is not obviously sarcasm and falls into the category of irony in the
wider sense.
The English lexicon contains certain established sarcastic or
ironic formulas. For instance, there is a standard expression to
use when giving someone a small sum of money, namely, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt
spend it all at once‚Äô. If somebody seems to be in an unnecessary
hurry, you say, ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs the Ô¨Åre?‚Äô Obviously there is no Ô¨Åre. You
are chiding the over-anxious person and trying to get them to
proceed more slowly. If somebody arrives or returns sooner than
expected, you can say, ‚ÄòWhat kept you?‚Äô A common way of
indicating that you think someone is complaining too much over
a minor condition is to say, ‚ÄòNothing worse!‚Äô In many situations
no ready-made expression is available, but sarcasm may feel ap-
propriate. For instance, a boy cuts his Ô¨Ånger and makes a lot of fuss
about it so someone says, ‚ÄòDo you want me to call an ambulance?‚Äô
An addressee is supposed to pick up on sarcasm or irony from
the discrepancy between an event and a comment, but sometimes
this misÔ¨Åres. Suppose a woman from a group of acquaintances gets
up and sings ‚ÄòAmazing Grace‚Äô. A member of the group who is
critical of the performance remarks to another, ‚ÄòWhat a fantastic
singer she is!‚Äô The addressee might be uncertain about the quality
of the singing and in doubt as to whether to take the statement at
face value. Recently it has become popular among younger
speakers to say the opposite of what is meant and then after a
pause add, ‚ÄòNot‚Äô. So someone with a poor opinion of the singer
might say, ‚ÄòWhat a fantastic singer she is! . . . Not!‚Äô
A good example of irony can be found in Aldous Huxley‚Äôs short
story ‚ÄòThe Portrait‚Äô. A nouveau-riche man approaches Mr Bigger,
an art dealer, with a view to purchasing some paintings for his
262
secret language
recently acquired ‚ÄòManor House‚Äô. Mr Bigger makes a comment
that is sarcastic, if you like, or ironical, and then there is further
irony in that the original irony is not picked up.
‚ÄòIn a house of this style,‚Äô he was saying, ‚Äòand with a position like
mine to keep up, one must have a few pictures. Old Masters,
you know; Rembrandts and What-his-names.‚Äô
‚ÄòOf course,‚Äô said Mr Bigger, ‚Äòan Old Master is a symbol of
social superiority.‚Äô
‚ÄòThat‚Äôs just it,‚Äô cried the other beaming, ‚Äòyou have said just
what I wanted to say.‚Äô
Mr Bigger bowed and smiled. It was delightful to Ô¨Ånd
someone who took one‚Äôs little ironies as sober seriousness.
A lot of speaking in opposites is meant to be joking. If I am
pouring myself a brandy, just as my disapproving daughter comes
by, I might remark, ‚ÄòPurely medicinal‚Äô. This kind of slightly
humorous antonymy is common in epithets. A heavy drinker
might be described as a teetotaller, a frigid woman as a nympho,
and an unintelligent person as an Einstein.
Oxymora and Other Contradictions
The oxymoron is a traditional rhetorical device in which the
modiÔ¨Åer in a construction appears to contradict the modiÔ¨Åed,
and the listener or reader has to try and resolve the anomaly. In
a typical example an adjective appears to contradict a noun, as
in democratic tyrant. English contains a number of lexicalized
examples such as bitter sweet, deafening silence, hasten slowly, and
perhaps timeless moment, which has some currency in the media.
There is an unwitting irony in some phrases used in advertising
263
the everyday oblique
and the media such as essential luxury and instant classic, but most
oxymora are deliberate attempts at irony. Sometimes the irony is
only apparent when a phrase is listed with other oxymora. For
instance, there does not usually seem to be anything incongruous
about the term political science, but when it is given in a list of
oxymora, one can see a certain irony. Other examples often pre-
sented in an ironic sense include business ethics, honest politician,
and government efÔ¨Åciency.

Literary Allusions
An allusion is an incidental or passing reference. If I say, ‚ÄòJim is so
mean he makes Scrooge look like a spendthrift‚Äô, I am making a
statement about Jim but alluding to Scrooge in the course of
making it. Allusions are not conÔ¨Åned to language; they can be
found in music and the visual arts. Many allusions are to Ô¨Ågures
from myth, history, or literature, to places, customs, or events.
Another type of allusion occurs when literary works (and
other creative productions) relate to earlier works. Julia Kristeva,
in her 1969 essay, ‚ÄòWord, Dialogue, and Novel‚Äô, termed this
265
‚Äòintertextuality‚Äô. It can range from similarities of plot and
character, to allusion, quotation, and parody. Vladimir Nabokov‚Äôs
novel Despair is rich in allusion to characters and events in earlier
works, particularly Fyodor Dostoevsky‚Äôs Crime and Punishment,
and the poems of T.S. Eliot are full of allusions to a great
range of European literature. His seventeen-page poem The
Waste Land is supplemented by seven pages of notes on the
allusions.
Allusions can also be internal to a work. The use of musical
themes in operas associated with characters and ideas, particularly
in Wagner‚Äôs operas, are of this type. For instance, in Lohengrin, as
we saw in Chapter 7, the knight who appears to save Elsa forbids
her to ask his name. Later, when Ortrud dares Elsa to ask the
knight to reveal his name, she uses a variation on the same melody
the knight used when he announced the ban.
Allusions to names are normally recognizable even if one can-
not identify the referent. If we read that someone has made the
greatest comeback since Lazarus, we know from the context that
Lazarus is someone the writer expects readers to recognize. More
interesting is the covert textual allusion where the wording of an
earlier text is worked seamlessly into the present text. Picking up
on the allusion is not essential to understanding the text, and that
is the whole point and the reason why literary allusions are
covered in this book. They are esoteric. They communicate to
an in-group who derive satisfaction from picking up the allusion,
while others may read the text without realizing there are allusions
lurking in it.
Allusion differs from quotation in that a quotation is usually
marked. Speakers often announce they are quoting, and writers use
266
secret language
quotation marks, but they don‚Äôt always do this, and the difference
between allusion and quotation is sometimes blurred. Good
examples of allusion and quotation and the blurring of the
distinction between them can be found in Willy Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory, the Ô¨Ålm version of Roald Dahl‚Äôs Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory. This is a Ô¨Ålm aimed at children, yet the speech of
Willy Wonka, the proprietor of the chocolate factory, is peppered
with passages from texts, some well known, others obscure. For
instance, Willy Wonka says, ‚ÄòA thing of beauty is a joy forever‚Äô,
which is a well-known line from Keats (Ô¨Årst line of Endymion), and
‚ÄòRound the world and home again, That‚Äôs the sailor‚Äôs way‚Äô, which
is from the poem ‚ÄòHomeward Bound‚Äô by the not very well-known
poet William Allingham (1828‚Äì1889). There is no indication as to
which of Willy‚Äôs utterances are from previous texts as he conducts
his guests around his chocolate factory, though it is obvious that
his speech is not everyday language but is full of rhymes and
rhetorical Ô¨Çourishes. There is little chance of children recognizing
the quotations; they are a kind of secret communication between
the writer of the screenplay and some members of the adult
audience. It is characteristic of Ô¨Ålms aimed at children that they
contain language and allusions aimed at adults. The whole plot of
The Lion King is an allusion to Hamlet, and it contains learned
words like afÔ¨Åanced and clever puns. In Madagascar four animals,
bred in captivity, escape from the Central Park Zoo and are
washed ashore in Africa. Finding themselves in nature for the
Ô¨Årst time one of them thinks they are in the San Diego Zoo, an
ironic allusion likely to be lost on children, who are unlikely to
know that that particular zoo is famous for keeping animals in
natural surroundings.
267
elusive allusions
One of the most esoteric allusions in literature, and one that
falls within the domain of linguistics, can be found in the 1968
science Ô¨Åction Ô¨Ålm 2001: A Space Odyssey written by Arthur Clarke
and Stanley Kubrik. When HAL, the computer controlling the
space mission, starts to malfunction, astronaut Dave Bowman
begins to dismantle its cognitive functions and it regresses. Its
last speech is a rendition of the popular song ‚ÄòDaisy, Daisy, give
me your answer do‚Äô. In 1962 this song was the Ô¨Årst text used at the
Bell Laboratories to demonstrate speech synthesis, and it was later
used in other phonetics laboratories. Audience members who
know this might pick up the suggestion that the song was one of
the Ô¨Årst texts taught to HAL; when his cognitive powers are
progressively removed, he is left with his Ô¨Årst text, just as humans
suffering from dementia retain best what was learnt Ô¨Årst.
Allusions in most literature are straightforward references to
persons, places, or events, but the corresponding allusions in
Germanic alliterative verse are often indirect. A feature of Ger-
manic alliterative verse is the use of a descriptive phrase or com-
pound to replace a regular word or name. As we saw in Chapter 3,
these phrases are called kennings. For instance, the sea was often
referred to as the whale-road or swan-road, and a warrior was a
feeder of ravens since ravens fed on the bodies of the slain. In the
Old Norse Skaldic verse these kennings are more esoteric and
often make reference to Norse mythology. For example, Odin
was sometimes called the hanged god, a reference to his having
hanged himself from the tree Yggdrasill for nine days and nights in
order to gain wisdom and power (H√°vam√°l 138‚Äì9), and mistletoe
was referred to as Baldur‚Äôs bane, a reference to the story that all
plants and animals swore never to harm Baldur, save the mistletoe.
268
secret language
The wrist was referred to as the wolf ‚Äôs joint, a reference to the fact
that Fenrir the wolf bit off Tyr‚Äôs hand.
Some traditional allusions have largely lost their original associ-
ations and have become part of the language, so that one can use
them without knowing their signiÔ¨Åcance. Take Achilles‚Äô heel, for
instance. It refers to the story of Achilles‚Äô mother, Thetis, dipping
her son in the river Styx to make him invulnerable. She held him by
the heel so this area remained vulnerable. A Trojan horse, which
lives on in the name of computer viruses, refers to the wooden horse
‚Äòpregnant with armed men‚Äô that the Trojans let into their besieged
city with fatal consequences (Virgil, Aeneid, Book II). Some allu-
sions lie buried in words and phrases like gargantuan, Herculean,
quixotic, sisyphean, tantalize, and titanic. Some appear in set phrases
such as since Adam was a boy and to the right of Genghis Khan.
An allusion can be made to an event or a practice. In T.S. Eliot‚Äôs
Murder in the Cathedral a messenger is asked about the ongoing
friction between Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry II
with the words, ‚ÄòBut again, is it war or peace?‚Äô The messenger replies,
‚ÄòPeace, but not the kiss of peace‚Äô. The reference is to the osculum pacis
‚Äòthe kiss of peace‚Äô practised as a greeting among Christians and
incorporated into the mass until the fourteenth century. It was also
known as the osculum sanctum ‚Äòholy kiss‚Äô, the term used in the
Vulgate translation of 2 Corinthians 13:12, where the Corinthians
are enjoined to greet fellow Christians with such an embrace.1
1
The exchange of kisses at mass was replaced in the fourteenth century
by a pax board, an icon passed around and kissed. The exchange of
greetings of peace among the celebrant and the congregation was reintro-
duced into the mass by Vatican II and in some non-Anglo cultures it
involves kissing among family members and friends.
269
elusive allusions
One of the main sources of literary allusion has been the Bible.
In the Authorized Version of the Song of Deborah there is a verse
which goes, They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
against Sisera (Judges 5:20). The phrase the stars in their courses has
caught the imagination. It has been adopted as the title of several
works on astronomy, including one by Sir James Jeans (1931) and
one by Isaac Asimov (1971). In these cases the phrase simply
supplies an apt title, but the same phrase was worked into the
text of a speech given by Winston Churchill in 1941 at a time when
Nazi Germany had occupied most of Europe, and Britain was
under threat. He said, ‚ÄòThe stars in their courses proclaim the
deliverance of mankind‚Äô.2
To those familiar with the Bible it
recalled a triumph of the Israelites and provided inspiration at a
time when, to use another of Churchill‚Äôs phrases, ‚Äòthe long night of
barbarism had descended over Europe unbroken even by a star of
hope‚Äô.
Some biblical allusions have become standard references, so that
we can refer to a David and Goliath contest, or say the writing is on
the wall, or speak of killing the fatted calf. We can call someone a
Judas or a Doubting Thomas or refer to someone as the Prodigal Son
(Luke 15:11‚Äì32). When we talk of someone wearing only a Ô¨Åg leaf
or eating forbidden fruit, we are indirectly referring to Adam and
Eve, and if we say something is not set in stone, we are indirectly
referring to Moses receiving the Ten Commandments on two
tablets of stone (Exodus 32:15, 34:1‚Äì5). A more direct reference

The speech was recorded in London and broadcast to the University
of Rochester Commencement when Churchill was awarded an honorary
degree of Doctor of Laws, June 16 1941.

In Trollope‚Äôs Barchester Towers two clergymen banter with biblical
quotations by giving chapter and verse and leaving the text
unspoken, as in the following anecdote.
A vicar went out one Saturday to visit members of his parish. At
one house it was obvious that someone was home, but nobody came
to the door even though the vicar knocked several times. Finally, the
vicar took out his card and wrote Revelation 3:20 on the back of it,
and stuck it in the door.
(Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice
and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and he
with me.)
The next day, the card turned up on the collection plate. Below
the vicar‚Äôs message was the notation Genesis 3:10.
(I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was
naked; and I hid myself.)
occurs when someone unable to Ô¨Ånd accommodation at a hotel
reports that there is ‚ÄòNo room at the inn‚Äô (Luke 2:7). Expressions
such as being all things to all men, to arise as one man, the blind
leading the blind, a man after one‚Äôs own heart, to escape by the skin
of one‚Äôs teeth, and signs of the times can be found in the Bible and
probably owe their currency to their appearance in that once
much-read text, but they are too much a part of the language
and too little associated with particular persons or events to count
as allusions.
Along with the Bible the other main source of literary allusions
is Shakespeare. The opening words of Richard III, which inciden-
tally contain a pun, have become a most hackneyed source of
allusion:
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this son of York
271
elusive allusions
A novel by John Steinbeck has the title The Winter of Our
Discontent and journalists writing about any unpleasant winter
have a tendency to trot out this phrase.3
In the 1980s there was a BBC television series called To the
Manor Born. This combines a pun and an allusion since it is based
on Hamlet‚Äôs remark,
though I am a native here,
And to the manner born,‚Äîit is a custom
More honour‚Äôd in the breach than the observance.
The expression pound of Ô¨Çesh, as in, ‚ÄòHe wants his pound of Ô¨Çesh‚Äô,
comes from Shakespeare‚Äôs Merchant of Venice where Shylock tries
to hold Antonio to a contract secured on a pound of Antonio‚Äôs
Ô¨Çesh. Many common expressions are found in Shakespeare,
including didn‚Äôt sleep a wink, in my mind‚Äôs eye, method in his/her
madness, and to eat someone out of house and home. Like the
examples from the Bible given above, they probably owe their
currency to their appearance in a much-read text, but they are not
recognized as having come from a particular source.4
The Winter of Our Discontent and To the Manor Born repre-
sent the tip of an iceberg. Innumerable titles of books, plays, and
Ô¨Ålms are allusive, as are names of various groups and organiza-
tions. The extent of Shakespeare‚Äôs popularity when it comes to
3
An advertisement for a sale of camping gear featured this clever
variation: Now is the discount of our winter tents.

‚ÄòI have not slept one wink‚Äô (Cymbeline III.4.103); ‚ÄòIn my mind‚Äôs eye,
Horatio‚Äô (Hamlet I.2.185); ‚ÄòThough this be madness, yet there is method in
it‚Äô (Hamlet II.2.211); ‚ÄòHe hath eaten me out of house and home‚Äô (King
Henry IV, Part 2, II.1.82).
272
secret language
choosing an allusive title is epitomized by the large number
of titles taken from Hamlet‚Äôs ‚ÄòTo be or not to be‚Äô soliloquy.
The italicized phrases in the following passage have all been
used as titles of various kinds, some of which are identiÔ¨Åed
below.
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether ‚Äôtis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep‚Äî
No more‚Äîand by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That Ô¨Çesh is heir to. ‚Äôtis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish‚Äôd. To die, to sleep‚Äî
To sleep‚Äîperchance to dream. Ay, there‚Äôs the rub!
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shufÔ¨Çed off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause‚Äîthere‚Äôs the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor‚Äôs wrong, the proud man‚Äôs contumely,
The pangs of disprized love, the law‚Äôs delay,
The insolence of ofÔ¨Åce, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death
The undiscover‚Äôd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than Ô¨Çy to others that we know not of ?

The Ô¨Ålm Chariots of Fire (1981) takes its title from a poem by
William Blake, which originally appeared in the preface to his epic
Milton (1804), but is better known as the hymn ‚ÄòJerusalem‚Äô. It is
quoted here in full as this short poem contains two phrases,
namely dark satanic mills and England‚Äôs green and pleasant land,
which are in common use. However, for many they would not be
recognized as allusions, or at least the source would not be known.
For such speakers these phrases would be just part of the stock of
idiomatic phrases in the lexicon, rather like salt of the earth or all
that glitters is not gold.
And did those feet in ancient time
walk upon England‚Äôs mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
on England‚Äôs pleasant pastures seen?
And did the countenance divine
shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
among these dark satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
274

Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!
Bring me my chariot of Ô¨Åre!
I will not cease from mental Ô¨Åght,
nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,
till we have built Jerusalem
in England‚Äôs green and pleasant land.
The phrase chariot of Ô¨Åre is itself an allusion to a passage in the
Bible in which the prophet Elijah is taken up to heaven in a chariot
of Ô¨Åre: ‚ÄòAnd it came to pass as they still went on and talked, that,
behold, there appeared a chariot of Ô¨Åre, and horses of Ô¨Åre, and
parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
heaven‚Äô (2 Kings 2:11). The theme of the Ô¨Årst stanza is also an
allusion, to the apocryphal story that Jesus Christ and Joseph of
Arimithea visited Glastonbury, which is in England‚Äôs green and
pleasant land. This story Ô¨Ågures in The Da Vinci Code.
Just as titles can be taken from texts, texts can incorporte titles as
allusions. In Ian Rankin‚Äôs novel Black and Blue we Ô¨Ånd the
following exchange (1997: 459):
‚ÄòAnd don‚Äôt think a reprimand is going to be the end of the affair.‚Äô
‚ÄòNot such much as the end of the affair,‚Äô Rebus told him, ‚Äòmore
like the heart of the matter.‚Äô
‚ÄòThe end of the affair‚Äô, meaning the end of the business in this
instance, is a common expression, but it happens to be the name of
a novel by Graham Greene. Rebus picks up on this and introduces
the title of another Greene novel, The Heart of the Matter.
Other popular literary sources of allusion include Alice‚Äôs Adven-
tures in Wonderland, Oliver Twist, Peter Pan, and Treasure Island,
though allusions to these works are to characters and situations as
275
elusive allusions
well as text. Alice is the source of the notion of the ‚Äòunbirthday‚Äô,
and a disorganized event is often described as being like ‚Äòthe Mad
Hatter‚Äôs tea party‚Äô. The hatter in Alice is often thought of as having
given rise to the expression ‚Äòmad as a hatter‚Äô, but this phrase was
used earlier, in Blackwood‚Äôs Edinburgh Magazine, January-June
1829, and has its origins in the idea that the mercury used in
hatmaking affected the nervous systems of hatters. In Dickens‚Äôs
Oliver Twist young Oliver, sent to toil in a workhouse, has the
temerity to ask for a second helping of gruel (‚ÄòPlease Sir, I want
some more‚Äô) ‚Äì an incident which is often cited when someone asks
for a second helping of food. J.M. Barrie‚Äôs 1904 play Peter Pan, or
the boy who wouldn‚Äôt grow up has led to a male who is slow to
mature sometimes being called a Peter Pan. It gave rise to Wendy
house, an alternative name for what is otherwise known as a play
house or cubby house, and to the term Neverland (or Never Never
Land ) for an imaginary paradise. This was also the name the late
Michael Jackson gave to his ranch in California, which incorpor-
ated an entertainment park for children. Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs
Treasure Island is a source of indirect allusion in that it has inspired
a genre of pirate adventure literature. The most recognizable
character is the one-legged pirate Long John Silver. It would be
difÔ¨Åcult to Ô¨Ånd a costume-hire Ô¨Årm in the English-speaking world
that could not supply a Long John Silver pirate outÔ¨Åt, complete
with parrot, peg leg, and crutch. Some literary works generate
speciÔ¨Åc verbal allusions, as with Joseph Heller‚Äôs Catch 22, the
source of ‚Äòa catch 22 situation‚Äô.
Although allusions are often esoteric, what is arcane for one
group can be common knowledge for another. Not all literary
allusions are to works having pretensions to high culture, despite a
276
secret language
certain snobbery about the superior value of highbrow knowledge.
Ambrose Bierce captures this narrow view in The Devil‚Äôs Dictionary
(see p. 88), where he deÔ¨Ånes ignoramus as ‚ÄòA person unacquainted
with certain kinds of knowledge familiar to yourself, and having
certain other kinds that you know nothing about‚Äô. In the Ô¨Ålm Die
Hard 2 Bruce Willis goes to an airport desk to collect a fax. The
young woman on the desk makes a pass, to which our hero replies,
‚ÄòJust the fax, ma‚Äôam‚Äô. This is a play on the words ‚ÄòJust the facts‚Äô
frequently uttered in a deep monotone by Joe Friday, a detective in
the TV series Dragnet. Popular culture abounds with allusions of
various kinds. The group Aerosmith had a hit called ‚ÄòLord of the
Thighs‚Äô, playing on William Golding‚Äôs 1954 novel Lord of the Flies.
The Ô¨Ålm The Usual Suspects takes its title from a line in another
Ô¨Ålm, namely Claude Rains‚Äôs instruction ‚ÄòRound up the usual
suspects‚Äô in Casablanca.
Some modern allusions are not at all esoteric. If we say, ‚ÄòHe thinks
he‚Äôs Tarzan‚Äô or ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not Superman‚Äô, we are making an allusion that
will be widely understood. The same applies if we call a very bright
person Einstein or use the name Sherlock for someone who solves
some little mystery. Some allusions are accidental, particularly
where they involve words of songs. You remark, ‚ÄòWhat a beautiful
morning!‚Äô and someone starts singing the opening number from the
musical Oklahoma, or someone ordering a beverage says, ‚ÄòTea
for two‚Äô, and somebody else starts singing, ‚ÄòTea for two, and two
for tea. . . ‚Äô.
One type of modern allusion is the catchphrase‚Äîa phrase that
captures the attention of a wide audience and is widely repeated.
Some catchphrases are derived from a genre. If I say ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs bigger
than both of us‚Äô (referring to love) I am repeating what is thought
277
elusive allusions
to be a clich√© from romantic movies of yesteryear, or if I say ‚ÄòThey
went thataway‚Äô I am repeating a catchphrase from an old Holly-
wood western. A more typical catchphrase has a deÔ¨Ånite source.
‚Ä¢ A catchphrase that has caught on is Show me the money, which
comes from the Ô¨Ålm Jerry Maguire. The words are spoken by
football player Cuba Gooding Jr to his manager, Tom Cruise.
‚Ä¢ Someone annoys you by repeating unwanted advice, so you say
Play it again, Sam, which is widely believed to be a quotation
from the movie Casablanca (it is actually a misquotation).
‚Ä¢ You want to indicate that you can solve a problem easily or
have done so, so you say Elementary, my dear Watson, a phrase
used by Sherlock Holmes to Dr Watson in Ô¨Ålms and television
dramatizations of the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
(though never in the original stories).
Presentations at conferences and essays in journals regularly use
puns and allusions in their titles. The titles of articles in news-
papers and magazines often attempt to be catchy or clever by
incorporating a pun or an allusion. For example, an article about
the armed robbery squad of the police force is headed The Force is
with them, which plays on the words May the force be with you from
the movie Star Wars. The title of the Ô¨Ålm Desperately Seeking Susan
has become a template into which journalists substitute for Susan
whatever they are writing about, so we get Desperately Seeking
Sienna, Desperately Seeking Solace, etc.
The allusions built into headlines are often just attempts at
verbal ingenuity, but the best allusions carry a message. When
Shakespeare‚Äôs Julius Caesar is being stabbed to death, he says Et tu,
Brute? ‚ÄòEven you, Brutus?‚Äô, expressing surprise that his friend is
one of the murderers. Several writers have worked variations on
278
secret language
this quotation into their text. One newspaper reported the
challenge to the leader of a political party with the heading, Et tu
Natasha?‚Äîan allusion which suggested the challenger was being
disloyal. A more arcane example I saw some years ago was the
caption O temptress! O mores! for a review of an autobiography of a
bed-hopping woman. The reviewer was playing on the Latin
quotation O tempora o mores ‚ÄòOh times, oh customs‚Äô, the sort of
thing a conservative might say about the alleged moral laxity of
younger generations. The allusion suggests horror, presumably
mock-horror, at the shocking revelations in the book.
Colloquial language is full of allusion. As two prominent
scholars put it, ‚ÄòThe very currency of slang depends on its allusions
to things which are not supposed to be universally familiar or
generally respectable‚Äô (Greenough and Kittredge 1931: 72). Rhyming
slang incorporates allusions such as Brahms and Liszt for ‚Äòpissed‚Äô
(i.e. drunk) and its updated version Schindler‚Äôs List (from the Ô¨Ålm
version of Thomas Keneally‚Äôs book, Schindler‚Äôs Ark). Allusion plays
a part in humour too. Many jokes depend on the audience picking
up on a reference. Among actors it is taboo to mention Shake-
speare‚Äôs Macbeth by name; it must be referred to as ‚Äòthe Scottish
play‚Äô. In a modern television adaption of the play by Peter Moffat,
set in a hotel kitchen with Macbeth as a chef, a sous-chef is
rebuked for mentioning a famous rival chef by name. He is told
to call him ‚Äòthe Scottish chef‚Äô.
One type of allusion is to mention the punchline of a joke. In
the 1997 Ô¨Ålm version of Lolita there is a scene in which a widow
(Melanie GrifÔ¨Åth), her lodger (Jeremy Irons), and her young
teenage daughter (Dominique Swain) are sitting around after
dinner. The widow, wanting to be alone with the lodger, tries
279
elusive allusions
get rid of young Lolita by saying, ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt it time we were in bed?‚Äô
Lolita, irritated by being addressed as a child, replies, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs with
the we, paleface?‚Äô This is the punchline of a joke in which the
Lone Ranger and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto, Ô¨Ånd
themselves surrounded by hostile Indians. The Lone Ranger says
to Tonto, ‚ÄòWe are in big trouble, Tonto‚Äô. Tonto replies, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs

In Summer, the Second Pastoral Alexander Pope incorporates
four lines from the aria ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôer you walk‚Äô from Handel‚Äôs opera
Semele. This extreme form of allusion has its roots in classical
literature. Aristophanes wrote verses consisting of lines from
Homer and Aeschylus, and a number of authors writing in Latin
composed works consisting entirely of lines from poets such as
Virgil, Horace, or Ovid. This strange practice outlived the Roman
empire and continued until at least the seventeenth century. Virgil
was the most common source. These poems are called centos.
Here is one stanza from an English cento (quoted in Augarde
1984: 140):
I only know she came and went,
Like troutlets in a pool;
She was a phantom of delight,
And I was like a fool.
These four lines are taken respectively from Powell, Hood, Words-
worth, and Eastman.
Allusive Names
Names are allusive. Some given names and family names suggest a
particular cultural background, and changing fashions mean that
280
secret language
certain given names have connotations of particular age groups.
Names such as Homer and Cleo(patra) allude to to historical
Ô¨Ågures, but not everyone is aware of the signiÔ¨Åcance of mytho-
logical and historical names. We have boys called Tarquin
(the early Roman king who raped Lucrece) and girls called Lilith
(the sexually voracious succuba of Jewish folklore) and Jezebel (the
wicked woman of the Bible, Kings 1 and 2). Some given names
refer to celebrities, as with Marilyn and Britney, though the
strength of the allusion depends on the distinctiveness of the
name. There was an increase in Elizabeths following the birth of
Princess Elizabeth later Queen Elizabeth II, but since Elizabeth is
not an unusual name, there is little if any perceived allusion.
Given names of humans are taken seriously, but where Ô¨Åctional
characters, registered animals, and properties are to be named,
there is scope for in-group allusion. When I was a child, I read a
comic strip in one of the local newspapers about two characters
called Pip and Emma. To me they were just arbitrary names, but I
subsequently learnt that pip emma was World War I signallers,
slang for p.m. (compare ack emma for a.m.). Recently I came
across a racehorse called Turing, and I wondered if the horse had
been named after the ill-fated mathematical genius, Alan Turing.
A check of the breeding revealed the sire was Bletchley Park, the
site of Britain‚Äôs code-breaking operations in World War II where
Turing was a leading light.
Names in pop music often incorporate allusion and word play.
The rock-and-roll singer Chubby Checker has a stage name that is
based on the name of an earlier rhythm-and-blues performer, Fats
Domino. The Latin rock-and-roll group Santana have an album
called Abraxas after the Gnostic deity (see Chapter 5), and a
281
elusive allusions
number of bands choose names that have dark, sinister, or occult
connotations. One example is Black Sabbath, who featured a song
of the same name which made much use of the dissonant tritone,
known as the devil‚Äôs interval. The heavy metal band Iron Maiden
takes its name from a medieval instrument of torture, and Styx
takes its name from the river in Hades. Some names refer to non-
mainstream sex. Soft Machine takes its name from a novel by
William Burroughs, most of whose works contain lots of explicit
gay sex, and Steely Dan refers to a large strap-on penis featured in
another Burroughs novel, The Naked Lunch.
The choice of names for characters in Ô¨Åction is often allusive
and sometimes the names are thinly disguised. In the Ô¨Ålm The
Blair Witch Project (1999) the witch of the title is called Elly
Kedward, a thinly disguised form of Edward Kelley (1555‚Äì1597),
who claimed to be a spirit medium and alchemist. He acquired a
kind of vicarious fame by being the collaborator of John Dee, the
celebrated mathematician, astronomer, and occultist. There are a
number of references to Edward Kelley in the literature of the
occult. For instance, in the 1987 Ô¨Ålm Angel Heart, based on the
novel Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg, the devil, who calls
himself Louis Cyphre (Lucifer), hires a private detective. The
private detective eventually encounters a character involved in a
ritual killing who goes under the names of Ethan Krusemark and
Edward Kelley. In chapter 113 of Umberto Eco‚Äôs Foucault‚Äôs Pendu-
lum Edward Kelley is summoned up at a s√©ance. In this work
Kelley is treated as an historical Ô¨Ågure, but in The Blair Witch
Project and Angel Heart his name is chosen in an occult context, a
choice which is signiÔ¨Åcant to those familiar with the occult but
apparently arbitrary to anyone else.
282
secret language
Nicknames are allusive in that they pick up on a perceived
characteristic. Those that are popular in the media are usually called
sobriquets (or soubriquets). For example, the sobriquet Satchmo
has been given to Louis Armstrong. It is based on ‚Äòsatchel mouth‚Äô
and refers to his embouchure. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been
dubbed the governator, a reference to his role in the Terminator and
his position as governor of California. Sobriquets are often used in
the media as a form of elegant variation and the alternation between
the real name and the nickname can be confusing for the uniniti-
ated. Commonly encountered examples include the Big Apple (New
York), GOP (Grand Old Party, i.e. the Republican Party in the
US), and the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street (the Bank of England).
Parody and Satire
Parody and satire involve allusion. A parody is a mocking imitation
of any form of artistic expression whether it be a literary form such
as a poem, a story, a religious text, a non-Ô¨Åctional text, a novel, a
Ô¨Ålm, or a play, or other forms such as paintings, ballet, or music,
especially vocal music. Parody is most effective if the audience can
match its distortions and incongruities point by point with the
original. A parody may consist of a few lines of verse, as with many
children‚Äôs parodies of nursery rhymes, popular poems, and songs,
or it can extend over a long passage or even a whole work. Satire
may be based on creative work or the target may be a person or
group associated with politics, religion, the arts or some other
prominent sphere. Although a satire can be short, as with various
comedy sketches, most satire is in the form of complete works such
as a play, a Ô¨Ålm, or a novel.
283
elusive allusions
The allusive dimension of parody and satire will not necessarily be
detected by their whole audiences; some people may take them at
face value. Most of the poems in Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland
are parodies and the originals would have been well known to Lewis
Carroll‚Äôs readership, but with the passage of time their familiarity has
waned, with the exception of ‚ÄòTwinkle, twinkle, little bat‚Äô in chapter
seven, which is a parody of ‚ÄòTwinkle, twinkle, little star‚Äô. The verses
still seem entertaining, but the fact that most of them mock senten-
tious poems is lost. In the following abbreviated examples Carroll‚Äôs
parody is given to the left and the original to the right.
In chapter two we Ô¨Ånd a parody of Isaac Watts‚Äôs ‚ÄòAgainst
Idleness and Mischief‚Äô:
How doth the little crocodile How doth the little busy bee
Improve his shining tail, Improve each shining hour,
And pour the waters of the Nile And gather honey all the day
On every golden scale! From every opening Ô¨Çower!
The poem ‚ÄòYou are old, Father William‚Äô in chapter Ô¨Åve is a parody
of a poem by Robert Southey (1774‚Äì1843) called ‚ÄòThe Old Man‚Äôs
Comforts and How He Gained Them‚Äô.
‚ÄòYou are old, father William,‚Äô
the young man said,
You are old, Father William,
the young man cried,
‚ÄòAnd your hair has
become very white;
The few locks which are
left you are grey;
And yet you incessantly
stand on your head‚Äî
You are hale, Father William,
a hearty old man,
Do you think, at your age,
it is right?‚Äô
Now tell me the reason,
I pray.
‚ÄòIn my youth,‚Äô father William
replied to his son,
In the days of my youth,
Father William replied,
284
secret language
‚ÄòI feared it might injure the
brain;
I remember‚Äôd that
youth would Ô¨Çy fast,
But, now that I‚Äôm perfectly sure
I have none,
And abused not my health
and my vigour at Ô¨Årst,
Why, I do it again and again.‚Äô That I never might
need them at last.
In chapter six the Duchess recites a parody of a poem called ‚ÄòSpeak
Gently‚Äô attributed to G.W. Langford:
Speak roughly to your little boy, Speak gently to the little child!
And beat him when he sneezes: Its love be sure to gain;
He only does it to annoy, Teach it in accents soft and mild;
Because he knows it teases. It may not long remain.
In chapter ten there is a parody of Isaac Watts‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Sluggard‚Äô:
‚ÄôTis the voice of the Lobster;
I heard him declare,
‚ÄôTis the voice of the sluggard;
I heard him complain,
‚ÄòYou have baked me too brown,
I must sugar my hair.‚Äô
‚ÄôYou have wak‚Äôd me too soon,
I must slumber again.
As a duck with its eyelids, so
he with his nose
As the door on its hinges, so
he on his bed,
Trims his belt and his buttons,
and turns out his toes.
Turns his sides and his shoulders
and his heavy head.
This chapter also contains ‚ÄòWill you walk a little faster? said a
whiting to a snail‚Äô, which echoes ‚ÄòWill you walk into my parlour?
said the spider to the Ô¨Çy‚Äô, but does not follow the sense of the
earlier rhyme.
Satire is usually deadpan, to borrow a theatrical term. It makes
use of exaggeration and irony to show that it is satire. It is not
uncommon for an audience to take satire seriously and miss the
target. When the British television programme The OfÔ¨Åce was
285
elusive allusions
broadcast, many viewers took it at face value, at least for a period,
since it appeared to be a serious drama until one noticed oddities
piling up.
In 1729 Jonathan Swift published a pamphlet entitled ‚ÄòA
modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people in
Ireland from being a burden to their parents or country, and for
making them beneÔ¨Åcial to the public‚Äô. He writes as a well-
intentioned economist. The tone is learned and full of math-
ematical calculations. This leads the reader to take the piece
seriously, and it is only the narrator‚Äôs outrageous suggestion
that the Irish sell their children as food (the last paragraph of
the extract below) that unmasks the whole work as a clever piece
of sustained irony.
It is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great
town or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads,
and cabin doors, crowded with beggars of the female sex, fol-
lowed by three, four, or six children, all in rags and importuning
every passenger for an alms. [ . . . ]
I think it is agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of
children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their
mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplor-
able state of the kingdom a very great additional grievance; and,
therefore, whoever could Ô¨Ånd out a fair, cheap, and easy method
of making these children sound, useful members of the com-
monwealth, would deserve so well of the public as to have his
statue set up for a preserver of the nation. [ . . . ]
As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years
upon this important subject, and maturely weighed the several
schemes of other projectors, I have always found them grossly
mistaken in the computation. It is true, a child just dropped from
its dam may be supported by her milk for a solar year, with little
other nourishment; at most not above the value of 2s., which the
286
secret language
mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful
occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I
propose to provide for them in such a manner as instead of being
a charge upon their parents or the parish, or wanting food and
raiment for the rest of their lives, they shall on the contrary
contribute to the feeding, and partly to the clothing, of many
thousands. [ . . . ]
I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts,
which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.
I have been assured by a very knowing American of my
acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed
is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food,
whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt
that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.
The rest of Swift‚Äôs essay discusses in great detail the advantages
of using Irish children as a source of meat. There is an element
of parody in that Swift is mocking reformist literature of his
time, but without having any familiarity with these writings
present-day readers can still see a bitter humour deriving from
the use of learned language and a serious tone for an outrageous
proposal.
Parodies of genres as opposed to parodies of particular works are
not uncommon. Comedians often write sketches taking off the
pompous style of politicians or the jargon of sports commentators.
Here is a parody of the overblown, clich√©d style often found in
television documentaries (Blake 2007: 18):
Looking at this humble cottage behind me it is hard to believe
that we are standing in front of the birthplace of a man who
would change forever the way we live. After him life would never
be the same again.

elusive allusions
A well-known satirical work is The Devil‚Äôs Dictionary published
by San Francisco columnist, Ambrose Bierce, in 1911. Some of
his entries are given below (some in abbreviated form). The
work is based on the conventional dictionary, but dictionaries
are not the target of the satire. Bierce uses the form of a
dictionary to make satirical comments about a great variety of
subjects.
diagnosis, n. A physician‚Äôs forecast of the disease by the
patient‚Äôs pulse and purse.
esoteric, adj. Very particularly abstruse and consummately
occult. The ancient philosophies were of two
kinds,‚Äîexoteric, those that the philosophers
themselves could partly understand, and eso-
teric, those that nobody could understand. It
is the latter that have most profoundly
affected modern thought and found greatest
acceptance in our time.
faith, n. Belief without evidence in what is told by one
who speaks without knowledge, of things
without parallel.
grammar, n. A system of pitfalls thoughtfully prepared for
the feet for the self-made man, along the path
by which he advances to distinction.
love, n. A temporary insanity curable by marriage or
by removal of the patient from the inÔ¨Çuences
under which he incurred the disorder.
queen, n. A woman by whom the realm is ruled when
there is a king, and through whom it is ruled
when there is not.

FINALE
T
his book describes ways in which people choose to be
oblique in their use of language as a system of commu-
nication and situations in which they are constrained
from indiscriminate direct communication. Four factors motivate
oblique communication:
‚Ä¢ a desire to tease or amuse
‚Ä¢ practical security
‚Ä¢ maintaining an identity
‚Ä¢ fear of the power of words.
A desire to tease and amuse leads to word games, riddles, irony,
and the use of colourful slang. The need for security prompts
people to devise ciphers and codes, both the elaborate written
ones used by governments, the military, and the Ô¨Ånancial world,
and spoken systems like rhyming slang, back slang, and Pig Latin.
The factors overlap. If we use some esoteric form of language such
as an argot, we are maintaining our identity as a member of a
subculture and operating a system that has some degree of security.
291
The most striking examples of deviating from straightforward
communication are tied up with a belief in a real connection
between a word, particularly a name, and its referent. This belief
leads to a fear of the power of words and hence to strong taboos
and restrictions on the use of language, particularly names thought
to have power to provoke the supernatural.
The more spectacular examples of constraints on the use of
language come from cultures remote from the modern West,
particularly from the written records of the early civilizations of
the Ancient Near East and the later worlds of Greece and Rome.
These cultures form part of our heritage and their inÔ¨Çuence is
reÔ¨Çected in mild versions of earlier taboos and beliefs. Western
culture has become increasingly secular over the course of the last
hundred years. There has been a decline in the numbers of
religious believers and a watering down of what the remaining
adherents believe, so naturally fewer and fewer people feel con-
strained by religious taboos. However, a Christian view of the
universe is still an important part of our culture. Literature regu-
larly alludes to life after death and the idea that heaven is up and
hell is down, a belief that does not sit easily with the notion of a
spherical world. The Christian universe is peopled by angels with
wings and horned devils with pitchforks. This view is enshrined in
the language. When we say, ‚ÄòDamn you!‚Äô or ‚ÄòGo to hell‚Äô, we are
using expressions that once referred to wishing someone an eter-
nity in the Ô¨Åres of hell. When we say, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre an angel‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe
child has an angelic smile‚Äô, we are alluding to the goodness and
beauty of angels.
There has also been a decline in those beliefs that mainstream
religion brands as superstition. However, many people still avoid
292
secret language
black cats, green paint, and walking under ladders. If they spill salt,
which is supposed to bring bad luck, they throw a pinch of salt
over their left shoulder to counteract the ‚Äòcurse‚Äô. Some numbers
are considered lucky and others unlucky. Many buildings avoid
having Ô¨Çoors or rooms numbered 13. Astrology lives on in the
horoscopes published in many newspapers and magazines, and
contagious magic persists in the practice of touching someone
who has, say, won the lottery in the hope that some of their luck
will ‚Äòrub off‚Äô. If challenged about the folly of these practices,
people usually claim that they do not take superstitions seriously.
Nevertheless, superstitious beliefs are as enshrined in the language
as the Christian view. Sometimes when people say something like
‚ÄòI‚Äôve never broken a bone in my life‚Äô, they will add ‚ÄòTouch wood‚Äô
and proceed to touch something made of wood in the hope of not
tempting fate. And the very phrase ‚Äòtempting fate‚Äô reÔ¨Çects a pre-
Christian belief.
As mainstream Christianity has declined in the West, there has
been a rise in interest in a variety of other belief systems, some
borrowed from various pre-Christian religions of the Ancient Near
East and Europe, and others from Third World religions. These
systems often go under the label New Age, and they embrace belief
in the supernatural and in natural forces and energies other than
those detectable by current science. They include I Ching, Feng
Shui, nature worship, witchcraft, and satanism, though this last is
in fact an offshoot of Christianity. Some of those who are involved
in the revival of ancient religious practices and witchcraft make use
of herbs, gemstones, cleansing rituals with Ô¨Åre and water, and
spells old and new. The volume of literature on the occult being
published in print and on the Web outweighs what was produced
293
Ô¨Ånale
in the heyday of the grimoire. All the features of the old literature
are preserved: word play, anagrams, palindromes, acrostics, and
the like, as well as a belief in an iconic relationship between
performance and effect. Some Web sites, for instance, recommend
reversing a spell to undo its effect.
The decline of religion in the West has not ushered in a new era
of linguistic freedom. Though few people today fear curses and we
are no longer likely to be prosecuted for blasphemy, as is still the
case in some Islamic countries, we do have new taboos on polit-
ically incorrect language, particularly in regard to race. One can be
legally penalized for using language that is considered racially
abusive, and there is no doubt that words like nigger have become
loaded with negative connotations and can be deeply offensive. On
the other hand attempts to impose new, politically correct termin-
ology can be repressive and authoritarian. For instance, basic
words such as blind, deaf, and dumb have sometimes been pro-
scribed, as have a variety of terms for mental illness ranging from
mad to lunatic. It is common to reprimand speakers and writers
who are thought to have erred, and even to publish their offences
in shame Ô¨Åles. A cryptic crossword compiler has been cited for
using expressions such as troppo, non compos mentis, and a screw
loose. We saw in Chapter 8 that colloquial language is particularly
rich with respect to human impairments, so the PC lobby is likely
to have an uphill battle.
Chapter 7 included examples of cultures where names were
considered an integral part of a person and were concealed from
enemies for fear of sorcery. We in the present-day West do not
share this apprehension, but given names are important, and it is
signiÔ¨Åcant that when people make a major change of lifestyle, they
294
secret language
often change their given name. Although in general we feel no
inhibition about using names, there is some taboo connected with
the names of enemies. People often become distressed at the
mention of the name of someone who has caused them pain in
the past, be it the perpetrator of a crime or simply an ex-partner
where there has been a bitter falling out. They refrain from
mentioning the enemy by name, and relatives, friends, and
acquaintances are expected to observe the taboo. Circumlocutions
such as ‚Äòyou know who‚Äô or ‚Äòa certain person‚Äô are used instead, or in
some cases derogatory phrases.
A mild taboo sometimes surrounds the names of authority
Ô¨Ågures. A manager or employer may be referred to anonymously
as ‚Äòthe boss‚Äô, ‚Äòhis nibs‚Äô, ‚Äòher nibs‚Äô, or ‚Äòyou know who‚Äô. Other forms
of reference may be shortened versions of a title or ofÔ¨Åce (the
CEO, the CO, the VC) or nicknames. The names of controversial
Ô¨Ågures are also sometimes avoided. I can recall meetings of an
organization where an important but opinionated Ô¨Ågure was often
absent. The absentee‚Äôs conduct and views were inevitably the
subject of discussion, but he was not mentioned by name. Mem-
bers would say things like, ‚ÄòSomeone wouldn‚Äôt stand for that‚Äô, ‚ÄòIt
won‚Äôt get whatisname‚Äôs vote‚Äô, or ‚ÄòThat won‚Äôt go down well in some
quarters‚Äô.
Whereas in the past only governments and businesses had to
concern themselves with secure means of communication, it has
become relevant to all of us who use any form of electronic
communication for conÔ¨Ådential or sensitive purposes. Most of us
have user names and passwords to access the Web sites of employ-
ers, banks and other Ô¨Ånancial institutions, clubs, societies, and so
on. We are conscious of the need to think up passwords that can
295
Ô¨Ånale
be kept in memory without being easy to guess, to change them
from time to time, and to keep them secure if written down. Most
of us have no direct experience of ciphers, but we trust that the
Ô¨Ånancial transactions we carry out via the internet are enciphered
securely by some kind of random key.
A new form of obscure language which developed in the twen-
tieth century is what is known to the public as ‚Äòmodern poetry‚Äô.
Whereas poetry up to the early twentieth century had been
metered in form and transparent in meaning, it became common
to write free verse in a kind of asyndetic, stream-of-consciousness
style. The result was often vague or ambiguous, rather like the
language of the traditional prophet. There was also experimental
poetry with extreme liberties of morphology and attempts to
maximize sound symbolism, as in the work of the Russian futurist
poet Velimir Khlebnikov (1885‚Äì1922). As we saw in Chapter 2,
palindromic poetry has become popular in Eastern Europe, and
various form of word play are a feature of modern poetry. The
American poet Harryette Mullen, for instance, likes to juxtapose
similar sounding words (emblems of motion muted amused mulish)
and to use the occasional anagram: tomboy girl with cowboy boots
takes coy bow in prom gown (Mullen 1996: 642, 646).
In thinking about secret and oblique language it may be illu-
minating to consider a modern news broadcast. It is normally in a
national language, it is explicit, and it is spoken slowly and
clearly‚Äîessentially a form of written language that is read aloud.
This is a variety of language found in many public speeches and
lectures. It represents one extreme of clear communication to a
wide audience. At the other extreme we have close acquaintances,
friends, or family speaking some form of in-group language,
296
secret language
perhaps a dialect or argot, or a mixture of both, using a teasing,
jocular style, full of abusive banter, making heavy use of pronouns
rather than speciÔ¨Åc nouns, sprinkled with local allusions and
double entendres, not at all explicit because speakers can assume
a lot about what addressees know, and marked by a lot of phonetic
reduction. This form of language is also a means of communica-
tion, one that is more sophisticated than the formal language in the
way it exploits shared knowledge, but one that seems obscure if
not secret to outsiders. Most spoken language falls between these
extremes, and most of us litter our speech with the some local
slang, the odd pun, a bit of irony, or an occasional allusion. To the
extent that we do so, we too are using ‚Äòsecret language‚Äô.
