the official language. It is important to point out the different use of the verb nevar in
both languages. Thus, while Portuguese usually resorts to the synthetic form, Creole
resorts to the analytical one.
		 Hoje nevou: “Today it snowed”.
		 Hoji cai nevi: “Today snow fell”.
Regarding granizar, both languages respond to the same parameter, since the Â�analytical
form is especially used, not the synthetic one.
		 Hoje caiu granizo: “Today hail fell”.
		 Hoji cai granizo: “Today hail fell”.
In Spanish, however, as we pointed out before, there is a great tendency to Â�
amalgamate
the figure, due to the fact that the information given by these conceptual elements
Â�
usually appears enclosed in the verbal lexeme.

Argument structure of causative meteorological denominal verbs
Causativity is a complex process which implies, at least, two fundamental participants:
a cause that produces the action, and an effect or result, which corresponds to a change
of state. This cause-effect relationship, as Pena (1993:â•›249) points out, can be encoded
in languages in different ways. In our meteorological denominal verbs the cause
Â�
component is conflated to the derivative verbal unit, which assumes the existence of
this causative element. The cause, called the “Antagonist” by Talmy (2000:â•›413), acts
like a force which causes a change of state on an entity and that corresponds to the
noun which constitutes the nominal base of derivation. Therefore, in causativity we
find two temporal sub-events: the causing sub-event and the caused sub-event (Levin
& Rappaport 1995:â•›83), among which there is an important temporal difference, since
at the beginning the entity that undergoes the change of state has still not acquired
the quality denoted by the cause and, in the second instant, the aforementioned entity
ends up modified or altered by the acquisition of this quality.
When a verb presents this causative value, it can be paraphrased, as Serrano-
Dolader points out, by “to make (cause) someone or something get to the state or
become x” (1999:â•›4687). Derivative verbs would be defined by Pena as “morphological
causatives” (1993:â•›249); while verbs which appear on the paraphrase (make, cause and
even put) would respond to the denomination of “analytical causatives” (1993:â•›249).
Let’s see some examples in order to understand this process better:
	(18)	 El cielo se aborregó [se cubrió de borregos] al caer la tarde [to cloud over].
	(19)	 La atmósfera se abrumó [se llenó de bruma] [to get full of mist].
	(20)	 El cielo se aniebló/anebló [se cubrió de niebla] [to get foggy].
	(21)	
Cuando fuimos a Santiago, el tiempo se emborrascó/aborrascó [se puso
borrascoso/se llenó de borrascas] [to get squalled].
ïœ±ïœ´	 Elisa Barrajón López
	(22)	
Hacía un día maravilloso, pero por la tarde el cielo se encapotó [se cubrió de
capotes]8 [to get cloudy].
	(23)	
Al estar la ventana abierta, el aire ha aventado [el viento ha hecho que se
muevan, dispersen o impelen] las invitaciones de la boda [to winnow].
In the previous examples, the noun which acts as a nominal base is responsible for the
change of state undergone by the subject, that is to say, it is what makes the subject
get to the state described by it. Thus, for instance los borregos, la bruma, la niebla,
la borrasca, los capotes or el viento are the ones that cause that el cielo, la atmósfera,
el tiempo, las invitaciones de la boda, etc., acquire the state or quality denoted by the
derivative base. That is why Serrano-Dolader points out that the value these verbs
Â�
present is that of “to acquire or to make someone or something acquire some of the
defining qualities of the base noun” (1999:â•›4714). Therefore, in these cases, the verb
usually expresses the content of the cause and is the argument the verbs tend to select,
which would explain that it is not usually specified, even though there would be some
cases, like aventar, that would not fit this parameter, since the cause is usually shown as
the subject of this verb. The fact that the cause component is usually the element con-
flated to the verb, would allow one to justify that these verbal lexemes do not Â�
present
the same degree of syntactical impersonality as the locative ones, since, in them, what
is emphasized is the final state in which the subject or the direct object (in the case of
aventar) is left, which is the caused element, as a consequence of the process described
by the verb.
It is curious that some of these verbs have a metaphorical meaning in other
Â�
languages, like Slovakian or Russian. Both Russian and Slovakian do not have an
Â�equivalent for El cielo se aborregó, except in a metaphorical sense: Oboha je plná
barančekov (“el cielo está lleno de borregos” [the sky is full of lambs]). Its use is not
frequent, but rather more stylistic. In other cases, like La atmósfera se abrumó or
El cielo se aniebló/anebló, denominal verbs in Slovakian (zhmlieva) and in Russian
(затуманить) have a metaphorical use (“to conceal the truth; to talk using hints”)
when the synthetic form is used. However, the analytical construction responds to the
proper meaning: in Slovakian, it would be padá hmla [“for the mist to fall”]; and in
Russian, Покрыть туманом [“to cover with mist”].
In Hungarian, these structures are used with a subject, so, as occurs in Spanish,
these verbs present a lower degree of impersonality than in the locative case:
ïœ¸.â•… It is meaningful that Serrano-Dolader points out that this verb could be interpreted as
locative or as instrumental (1995:â•›124). We, however, consider it as causative, since the noun
which acts as a base (los capotes) is the cause that of the change of state in the subject el cielo
[the sky].
	 On meteorological denominal verbs in Spanish 	 ïœ±ïœµ
		 Beborult az ég: “The sky got covered with clouds”.
		 Párás lett a levegő: “The atmosphere got full of mist”.
		
Leszállt a köd: “the fog went down” (in this case, the verb to go down
is used).
In Polish there is a synthetic form for aborregarse, but there is not one for anieblarse.
In the case of aborregarse, it is not necessary for the subject to be specified, since it is
understood that it means the sky:
		 (Niebo) Zachmurzyło się: “(El cielo) se aborregó” [the sky clouded over].
		Była mgła: “Había niebla, era niebla, estaba niebla” [there was fog,
it was foggy].
The verb aborregarse does not exist in Romanian, as opposed to the verb anieblarse,
which has its corresponding subject:
		 Cerul se înnoră: “El cielo se aniebló/anebló” [the sky got foggy].
However, both Portuguese and Creole only have the analytical form:
		 O céu esta coberto de nevoeiro: “The sky is covered with fog”.
		 Céu sta coberto de nivoeru: “The sky is covered with fog”.
In any case, what can be observed when analysing languages which are different from
Spanish, is that these verbs are usually accompanied by a subject and that their degree
of impersonality is, therefore, lower. This is due to its causative character and to the
fact that it is precisely the cause component which appears amalgamated to the verb in
most of the examined examples.
Besides these verbs, we have found another small subgroup in which, as Ruth
Lavale (2008:â•›425) points out, the change of state is understood, in a broader sense, as
the change from existence to non-existence; that is to say, the action described by the
verb means the creation of the object designated by the base noun:
	(24)	 Con la tormenta relampagueaba [se producían relámpagos] sin cesar.
	(25)	 La noche pasada ha helado [se ha producido una helada].
	(26)	 En diciembre empieza a escarchar [formarse escarcha].
	(27)	
En noviembre, suele tempestear/tempestar [producirse una tempestad]
en esta zona.
The paraphrase “Producirse/formarse [conflated noun]”, indicates that one of the
implicit arguments of the verb (the one that should be realized syntactically as a
Â�
subject) is an entity which is not pre-existent to the verbal action, so what emerges
as a result of it, i.e. the change of state undergone in these cases by the base noun,
is a change of state from non-existence to existence. This executed or resulting entity is
ïœ±ïœ¶	 Elisa Barrajón López
strongly restricted, from the semantic point of view, by the verb, which goes so far as
to assume its content and makes it unnecessary to make it explicit. For these reasons,
this subgroup, as opposed to the previous ones of causative value and similarly to the
Â�
locative ones, presents a high degree of impersonality. The same impersonal character
can be appreciated in other languages. Thus, for instance, in the case of relampaguear,
Slovakian only uses the synthetic form, which would not be accompanied by any
Â�
subject; Russian would only use the analytical one:
		Blíska: “relampaguea” [there’s lightning].
		 Блещут молнии: “brillan los relámpagos” [lightning bolts are shining].
In Hungarian, Polish and Romanian, the structure would not have a subject either:
		
Szüntelenül villámlott a viraban: “Con la tormenta relampagueaba sin cesar”
[the storm, boltsflashed incesantly].
		
W czasie burzy błyskało się bez przerwy: “Con la tormenta relampagueaba
sin cesar”.
		
În timpul furtunii fulgera necontenit: “Con la tormenta relampagueaba
sin cesar”.
Portuguese and Creole do not have the corresponding synthetic form. They only have
the analytical one:
		
Com a tempestade se fazia relámpagos: “Con la tormenta se producían Â�Â�
relámpagos” [The storm produced lightning].
		
Cu es tempestade sa ta daba relámpago: “Con la tormenta se producían
relámpagos”.
Another verb used in an impersonal way in other languages would be the verb helar
[to freeze]. Slovakian uses the verb mrznuť [it freezes]. In Russian, we would have
the analytical structure: Покрываться льдом, oбледенеть [to get covered with ice].
In Hungarian and Romanian, we would also have the impersonal structure, with no
subject:
		
A múlt éjszaka fajito: “La noche pasada ha helado” [Last night there
was frost].
		 Noaptea trecută a înghețat: “La noche pasada ha helado”.
4.3â•… 
Argument structure of inchoative meteorological denominal verbs
In our corpus of examples, we have found some meteorological denominal verbs which
present a clear inchoative content, since all of them refer to the beginning of an action.
In this sense, we can mention the following references:
	 On meteorological denominal verbs in Spanish 	 ïœ±ïœ·
	(28)	
Cuando anochece (empieza a faltar la luz del día, a venir la noche), los
Â�
habitantes de Turfan se suben a las azoteas [daylight is disappearing/as
the night /falls].
	(29)	
La noche transcurrió tranquila y al alborear/alborecer (empezar a aparecer
la luz del día, el albor) ya estaban en pie [daylight is beginning to show;
dawn is breaking].
	 (30)	
El sol se oculta, se apaga el día y atardece (empieza a caer la tarde)
[dusk is beginning to fall].
In these cases, the content expressed by the nominal base (la noche, el albor, la tarde
[night, dawn, dusk]) is conflated with the verb, in a way that makes it unnecessary to
make it explicit. This is why these verbal forms present a high degree of syntactical
impersonality, which is only altered if it is necessary to sub-specify the content of
the base.

5.â•… Conclusions
With this paper, we intended to take a glimpse at the study of meteorological Â�denominal
verbs. In order to do that, besides dealing with the morphological processes which
take part in its formation, we have tried to establish the argument structure which
underlies each of the studied examples in order to determine the conceptual elements
condensed in the verbal lexeme, and to carry out, from them, a provisional semantic
subclassification, conditioned fundamentally by the semantic contents contributed by
each of the arguments conflated in the verb.
The synchronic study of some meteorological denominal verbs has lead us to infer
that these verbs represent a heterogeneous category in which it is possible to differen-
tiate between several semantic subclasses (locative, causative and inchoative), as well
as to underline their different degrees of syntactical impersonality according to the
implicit argument which restricts each case. However, it is still necessary to complete
this analysis with the study of other meteorological denominal verbs that, due to lack
of space, we have not been able to deal with here. With that, we intend to improve this
first semantic subclassification and to go deeper into the internal functioning of these
verbal lexemes.
In order to justify the analysis we are proposing here and to check if the
Â�
functioning of our meteorological denominal verbs responded to the same param-
eters in other Â�
languages, we have examined some structures in Slovakian, Russian,
Â�
Hungarian, Â�
Polish, Romanian, Portuguese and Creole, which appear synthesized in

Instrumental verb formation
A conceptual approach*
Javier Bolaños Navalón
University of Alicante
This chapter deals with instrumental denominal verbs. After examining some
general aspects of denominal verbalization processes, on both a morphological
and semantic level, it focuses on instrumental formations. Some previous theories
on the concept of instrument are briefly revised in order to test their validity for
the analysis of a corpus of instrumental verbs. The paper goes on to conclude that
it is essential to bear in mind the distinction between instrument and instrumental
construction, as well as the process of conceptual conflation inserted in the
lexeme itself in order to deal with these verbs. This article consequently offers a
classification based on a semantic, conceptual model.
Keywords:â•‡ instrument; instrumental construction; instrumental denominal
verbs; denominal verbalization; conflation

Denominal verb formation
Language is a complex phenomenon, due both to its richness in nuances and variables
and to its capacity of adaptation and transformation which reflects the communicative
need of the speakers, who use all the mechanisms available to modify it according to
their requirements. This malleability that language displays represents an aspect that
adds a degree of difficulty to the study of language, which must be addressed from
Â�different perspectives in order to provide a full image of the phenomena that take place
within it.
Probably one of the best examples of this ductile character can be found in the
so-called word formation processes, among which the most productive in Spanish is
derivation. Within derivation, two branches can be found depending on the result
the addition of affixes has on the bases. We speak of appreciative affixing in cases in
*â•‡ This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science through
grant HUM2006–09429.
ïœ²ïœ²	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
which the derived term simply presents a change in the nuance of meaning, adding
subjective-emotional senses and without grammatical recategorization. On the con-
trary, non-appreciative affixing implies the creation of new terms (nouns, adjectives,
adverbs or verbs) semantically different from their bases and, most often, belonging to
different categories (Lang 1997).
We can understand verbalization as the “word creation process that enables the
creation of verbs from bases belonging to various categories” (Serrano 1999:â•›
4685).
Although the bases can correspond to different categories, as stated by many authors,
they are often selected among nouns and adjectives.
The formation of verbs from nouns is especially rich thanks to the variety of
nuances in the meanings these bases lead to, so semantically heterogeneous, while at
the same time they reveal a highly complex phenomenon that should be addressed,
as indicated above, from various perspectives. The most traditional studies have paid
Â�special attention to their morphological aspects; however, the lexical formation process
through which an element from the noun category acquires predicative features must
take into account morphological, syntactic and semantic processes (Lavale 2008:â•›419)
since this is the only way to provide a complete vision of denominal verbalization.
So, in the following sections I will try to briefly go through some of the aspects
of denominal verb formation in Spanish, on a morphological, syntactic and semantic
level, in order to later focus on those constructions that, in my opinion, imply instru-
mental formation. I will briefly discuss some points of view regarding instrument
to see if these theories can be applied to the corpus of instrumental denominal verb
Â�
constructions which is the aim of my study, as well as the problems derived from this.
Finally, I will attempt to present the initial classification I propose for these formations
according to a semantic-conceptual model.
1.1â•… Morphological aspects
Numerous authors have observed the processes that come together at this level within
the verbalization phenomenon.1 I will merely point out that we must bear in mind
two procedures involved in the creation of verbs from nouns in Spanish: suffixing and
parasynthesis.
The former consists in the addition of a derivative suffix to a noun base. This can
be carried out immediately, i.e. directly adding the verb ending, or through mediate or
complex derivation, where the theme vowel is indirectly added to the derivation base.
Let us look at an example of each case: on one hand, martillear < martillo [to hammer
ïœ±.â•… For a detailed description of the morphological aspects of this process, see Pena (1993);
Lang (1997) or Serrano (1999).
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ²ïœ³
< hammer] adds the suffix -ar to the base2 in an example of immediate derivation; on
the other hand, the case of vaporizar < vapor [to vaporize < vapour] can serve as a
sample of mediate derivation, in which the theme vowel of the derivative suffix is not
added directly to the base.
Along with the process of suffixation, the other procedure that requires attention
is parasynthesis, conceived as a mechanism of simultaneous suffixation and Â�
prefixing.
Using martillo once again, we can find an example of parasynthesis with the verb
amartillar [to hammer]. It is important to point out that both derived words Â�
present
the same noun base; despite the presence of the term martillar, amartillar is not a
deverbal result of it, instead both terms are derived from the noun martillo, which
therefore allows us to talk of parasynthesis.
1.2â•… Syntactic aspects
Although it is difficult to separate syntactic and semantic aspects, I will now attempt
to establish some theoretical bases related to the syntactic level of denominal verb
constructions.
If there is a process that syntactically characterizes these formations it is the
Â�
so-called conceptual incorporation. According to Cifuentes (1999:â•›
126), it is a
mechanism through which a noun, which has a given function as regards the verb,
becomes a modifier of that verb, leading to a new complex verb with one argument
less than the original. Therefore, incorporation, as a denominal verbalization mech-
anism, implies integrating a noun into a verb to create a complex form that, within
a new semantic entity, presents both predicative values carried by the verb and ele-
ments or properties added by the incorporated argument. That is, two independent
elements become one, thus reducing and redistributing the argument content of the
resulting structure.
The mechanism of conceptual incorporation leads us to consider the existence
of two different structures that represent the same conceptual content: on the one
hand, an analytical structure, where the verb and its different arguments are explicit
and morphologically and syntactically independent from each other; and, on the
other hand, a synthetic structure that presents an argument of the verb incorporated
within it, and which, consequently, possesses a different argument weight to that of its
Â�analytical paraphrase
ïœ².â•… As pointed out by Serrano (1999), it is important to bear in mind the form of the
Â�
derivative verbal suffix due to the very nature of the verb.Although we can talk of suffixes like
-ar, for example, we must be aware that this form corresponds to the infinitive, meaning the
element suffixed is the theme vowel or, otherwise, its zero allomorph, though for reasons of
Â�
explanatory commodity we work with the infinitive as a sample of the whole verb paradigm.
ïœ²ïœ´	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
This proposal, in turn, poses two questions to deal with regarding the relation
between both structures: the equivalence between analytical and synthetic structure,
and the derivation of one as regards the other.
I believe, in agreement with other authors (Serrano 1999; Cifuentes 2006a), that it
is wrong to consider the analytical structure and the synthetic structure equal, as they
are two different constructions. It is undeniable that there is a relation between the two
and, derived from it, an interest that can be caused by the use of the analytical para-
phrase as a metatheorical tool arises. Nevertheless, this use of the paraphrase does not
lead me to an analytical position as the one proposed in the old lexical decomposition
of generative semantics. As well as the problems inherent to it, such as the use of the
language itself to decompose language, which leads to a never ending spiral of decom-
positions, the use of paraphrases as a comprehensive mechanism cannot be compared
with decomposition, since there exists a truly linguistic relationships between the
nouns forming the derivation base and their resulting derivations (Cifuentes 2006a); it
seems logical to consider that in a sentence like “el verdugo flageló al reo” [the execu-
tioner whipped the prisoner] we can see how the term flagelar bears a clear relation
to the noun flagelo [whip], meaning the instrument has conflated with the predicative
content of “action carried out with”. Nevertheless, this fact cannot lead us to equalize
the synthetic and analytical forms.
In addition, and also related to the ease with which the synthetic structure
can be compared with its analytical paraphrase, there is the underlying debate on
whether the latter is the origin of the former. Regarding this and following the same
line as in the previous question, I believe both constructions are different, and their
similarities are not found in derivation but in a shared conceptual origin. Therefore,
in the same way I do not think it is appropriate to equalize the two structures, I
do not agree with considering synthetic formations a result of a derivation process
from their analytical pairs. Instead, I believe they are different conceptualizations
with a shared conceptual origin and they represent the ability of language to update
a series of semantic contents in two different syntactic structures, similar to what
occurs in other types of constructions, such as local-partitive and holistic structural
alternations.
1.3â•… Semantic aspects
In the same way the process of incorporation seems to explain denominal verbaliza-
tion from a syntactic point of view, the corresponding semantic mechanism for this
process is conflation, a term proposed by Talmy (2000). This concept is closely related
to incorporation but, according to Cifuentes (2006a: 263), some differences can be
found between the two, which mark the point of view from which each process is
approached. While incorporation is based on argument reduction of the synthetic
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ²ïœµ
structure as regards its analytical pair through the inclusion of a verb argument within
the verb itself, the concept of conflation presents less constraints when it comes to
Â�
possible derivation bases, allowing a greater combinatory variety and focusing more
on semantic and conceptual aspects.
As I mentioned above, this separation between syntax and semantics is merely
methodological and, perhaps, excessively firm and simplistic, hence the huge
Â�
similarities between the two constructions.
Their main common point is the assumption of two different levels they operate
on: on one hand, concepts, and on the other, linguistic realizations. I mentioned when
talking about incorporation that denominal verbalization shows the relation between
the two structures: a synthetic one in which the elements involved in the derivation
process are conflated into a new form with a complex meaning, and an analytical
structure that displays the verb and its arguments in phonetically, morphologically,
syntactically and semantically independent entities. Nevertheless, I believe that both
structures cannot be understood to be equivalent nor can either of them be taken as
the origin of the other. That is, the denominal verb is not a formation created from the
syntactic structure of the analytical one, but both constructions are on the same level
and reflect the same conceptual origin.
Therefore, when speaking of conflation we should consider two operative levels: a
conceptual, metatheorical, level; and a linguistic level, to which the different actualiza-
tions of these conceptual contents would correspond, which the speaker can develop
thanks to the mechanisms of language. All of this is the product of our capacity to con-
ceptualize one same scene through different constructions, as pointed out by Grau-
mann (2004). Thus, starting with conceptual content like GOLPEAR/CON3/PALO the
speaker can choose to develop an analytical structure, as in “golpear con un palo” [to
hit with a stick], or a synthetic structure like “apalear” [to beat].
From my point of view and in agreement with Lavale (2008), the concept of con-
flation is what best explains cases of denominal derivation, since in these cases there
is a union of two elements from different categories, leading to a recategorization in
the resulting element which includes two or more conceptual units in a new complex
item: the denominal verb.
Nevertheless, this theory introduces a new question; if synthetic Â�
constructions
are the result of a process of conflation of conceptual contents, what concepts are
Â�
susceptible to being conflated?; that is, which conceptual structures do underlie
denominal verb formations?
ïœ³.â•… I have decided to analyze the preposition CON as a paradigm of the conceptual content
of instrument, since it regularly accompanies nouns that transmit this content in Spanish
analytical constructions.
ïœ²ïœ¶	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
It does not take long to realize, when looking at these samples, that not all
Â�
contents are susceptible to producing denominal verbs or, at least, not under any
type of conceptual structure. Let us think of the example given above; the concepts
GOLPEAR/CON/PALO are joined in an instrumental conflation and not in another
kind, which implies that apalear can be easily understood as an instrumental
Â�
conflation by speakers, even if they do not know what it means. Furthermore, within
the instrumental formations themselves it seems that not all nouns can develop the
same types of structures. Therefore, it seems clear that lexical creativity is limited
to certain conceptual structures or foreseen underlying patterns: it is interesting
to see how Val Álvaro (2007) points out that “in the case of planchar [to iron] we
have conceptualized the idea of “alisar con plancha [straightening with an iron]”.
But our knowledge of the world could have been different, and if it were normal to
execute by hitting with an iron, perhaps we would have conceptualized “to kill with
an iron”. However, Â�
speakers have opted for one conceptualization and no other and,
furthermore, it is interesting to note that both conceptualization proposals respond
equally to two Â�
possibilities within the instrument conceptual pattern.
Cifuentes (2006a) proposes a small typology of possible patterns that allow the
creation of these formations, although as he acknowledges, it is still a temporary
Â�
classification that requires further study and which may be altered in the future. In it
he gathers six kinds of constructions: inchoative, agentive, causative, privative, locative
and instrumental.
Inchoative content appears in verbs such as florecer, which proposes a conceptual
structure of the “convertir(se) en flor” [to become a flower] type, and reflects a change
of state process from one element that was not a flower to one that now is. However,
they can also be classified along with resultative structures like esclavizar [to enslave],
or with metaphorical senses such as endiosar [to deify].
Agentive formations reflect the conflation of the concept of action with its
Â�
prototypical agent, as in the case of profetizar [to prophesy], paraphraseable in a
Â�
construction along the lines of “to act like a prophet”.
The causative content, studied by Lavale (2008:â•›
423), is “what defines those
Â�
situations of reality composed of two events, one with the role of cause and the other
playing the part of the effect or what is caused”. Within this group frequentative
Â�
values can be distinguished, as in bromear [to joke], iterative values like in silabear
[to Â�
pronounce each syllable], or effective as in despadazar [to shred].
Another kind included in this classification is that of privative conceptualiza-
tion. In this group we find verbs such as despiojar [to delouse] where there is an
underlying grammatical structure of the “quitar los piojos” [to remove head lice]
kind. In our opinion, and with the lack of greater study, this type is closely related to
the locative kind, and could actually be considered a subtype of localization, as the
author points out.
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ²ïœ·
The group with which Cifuentes has gone into greater depth in his investigation
is that of local constructions. This pattern subsumes conceptualization with locative
schemas, both static and dynamic (positioning and motion), using Talmy’s (2000)
localization schema as a starting point. An example of this type of conflation could be
a verb such as archivar [to file], paraphraseable as “to put in a file”.
I have deliberately left the instrumental pattern last and will be focusing on it over
the following pages since it is the aim of my study. I must point out that this pattern
is extremely complex, especially due to the semantic heterogeneity both of the types
of actions and of the bases that lead to these formations, which complicates their sys-
tematization and classification. To illustrate this type of conflation we can resort to the
examples mentioned above of apalear or martillar, whose analytical pair can be found
in constructions like “golpear con un palo/un martillo” [to hit with a stick/a hammer],
or others like telefonear [to telephone], which has a conceptual structure along the lines
of “to call/to communicate by telephone”; in short, it is the conflation of the concepts of
instrument and the obvious prototypical actions carried out with them.
2.â•… 
Instrument: Definition and types
Once we have reached this point, the first question to address is: what do we
Â�
understand by instrument? Thus, in the following pages I will try to briefly explain
some Â�
perspectives on analytical instrumental constructions, mainly following the
works of Schlesinger (1995) and Conti (2004), in order to find out if they cover
the formation process involved in denominal constructions with an instrumental
Â�
semantic base, as they do with analytical instrumental constructions.
The bibliography on the concept of instrument has focused on studying the
Â�
realizations I have been calling analytical. That is, those in which the instrument
appears as a phrase, phonetically, syntactically and semantically independent;4
Â�
however, bearing in mind the corpus I have been working with, these conceptual
contents can also be present through the process of conflation as denominal verbs
that integrate the action and the instrument in a single complex form.
The dictionary of the Real Academia Española (2001) defines instrument as “what
we use to make or do something”. This definition may seem very broad and general, but
it is what Spanish speakers think of when introducing an instrument into a Â�
sentence.
This way, almost anything can constitute an instrument, so long as it can lead to the
performance of an action.
ïœ´.â•… Nevertheless, there are some references to instrumental denominal verb formations, as
can be seen in Sala (1996), Jonkers (1998), Beniers (2002), Graumann (2004), Emsel (2005) or
Harley and Haugen (2007).
ïœ²ïœ¸	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
Resorting to a more technical definition like the one read in Schlesinger (1995),
which defines instrument as “An argument referring to what assists another argument
in the clause, enabling it to perform the action referred to by the predicate”, we can see
that the broadness of the definition does not disappear, the instrument being quite
simply a phrasal element that allows another to perform the action indicated by the
predicate.
Schlesinger himself seems conscious of the scope of this definition, and proposes
a classification of instruments in ten types, which I will list below,5 in order to at least
minimally organize this miscellaneous grouping of elements:
1.	Tools: Jack cut the cake with a knife
2.	 Means of transport: She came by plane
3.	 Body parts: He peeled the apple with his left hand
4.	 Abstract instruments: You ought to persuade him with nice words
5.	Material: We washed the dishes with soap
6.	 Means of communication: We informed him of the accident by phone
7.	 Secondary tools: Burt ate the spaghetti with a spoon
8.	Ingredients: They built the house with bricks
9.	 Support tools: I changed the bulb with a ladder
10.	Instrument/patient: The biologist experimented with some rabbits
Using this typology, Schlesinger concludes that instruments can be grouped Â�
according
to the presence or absence of the CAUSE feature. So, he classifies tools, means of
Â�
transport, body parts, abstract instruments and materials as causal instruments, and
Â�
secondary tools, ingredients, support tools and instrument/patients as non-causal,
leaving an Â�
intermediate space for means of communication and some specific tools.
On that same line and aiming to reflect the duality of values that the instrument
shows, Conti (2004) establishes a distinction of instruments by configuring them
according to the “causal/instrument-utensil” pair, also known as “causal/non-causal”,
that can be seen in examples like (a) Juan cortó la carne con el cuchillo [Juan cut the
meat with the knife] as opposed to (b) Juan sorbió la sopa con la cuchara [Juan sipped
the soup with the spoon]. In the case of (a), “con el cuchillo” would be interpreted as a
causal element that would be included in the causative chain of the process expressed
by the predicate “cortar” as a secondary or second cause of the action, which could be
placed in the position of the subject in the absence of the first cause (el cuchillo cortó
la carne [the knife cut the meat]); however, in (b), “con la cuchara” would not be a
direct cause of the action, but would imply an initial target of the action or a second
ïœµ.â•… This same typology is used by Conti (2004:â•›170–1),from which I have taken the translations.
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ²ïœ¹
Â�
indirect cause (the possibility of placing the instrument in the place of the subject
would Â�
vanish in this case, since it is not a semantic subject of the action, and the
Â�structure *la cuchara sorbió la sopa [the spoon sipped the soup] would be anomalous).
I will not go on to develop Conti’s entire methodological system at this point, which
is very well explained in her work, but I will point out that the double interpretive
Â�
possibility of the instrument was already mentioned when the author included it on
the TRANSITUM function and assigned it the Concomitant role. Referring to this
theory, causal Â�
instruments are the reflection of the focalization of the origin on the
TRANSITUM function and the assimilation of the macro-role of Concomitant to the
cause, while instrument-utensils show the lack of focalization or eventive focalization
of the TRANSITUM; so the causal instrument acts as a direct second cause of the
action, while the instrument-utensil acts as an indirect second cause or first goal.
2.1â•… 
Adaptation problems of these proposals for analytical cases
In spite of what I mentioned in the previous sections regarding the characterization
of the instrument, when trying to apply these proposals to the series of denominal
formations included in my initial work corpus, I was able to observe a series of irregu-
larities or conflicts between these proposals and their accommodation in synthetic
formations.
If we pay attention to Schlesinger’s broad classification, I believe it suggests certain
mix of criteria. On the one hand, some of the types of instrument seem to be defined
according to their lexical nature, such as body parts or ingredients, while, on the other,
there are types that are clearly marked by semantic aspects related to the predicate in
which they are included, as is the case of secondary tools.
This dependence of the structure leads me to pose the basic problem encountered
when applying these proposals to instrumental denominal verbalizations; Â�Schlesinger’s
classification does not go so much by instruments as by instrumental constructions,
i.e. he does not attempt to classify instruments as an element of reality (a matter that
I do not think is relevant to linguistics), but rather the constructions in which these
elements appear; more specifically, in their analytical realizations.
The same occurs with the classification between “causal” and “non-causal”
Â�constructions,thatbothSchlesingerandContipresent.HeretoothereisanÂ�unbreakable
relation between the categorization of instruments and the analytical constructions in
which they are inserted, meaning they are different formations to synthetic construc-
tions, as I explained above. It seems coherent that if certain theories are limited by
the type of construction they are applied to, they should not be valid for different
Â�
constructions, though they may share a common conceptual origin.
Therefore, in my opinion, it is necessary to distinguish between instrument and
instrumental construction. When we mention instrument we are referring to objects
ïœ³ïœ°	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
that, as indicated by Schlesinger, assist another phrasal argument in carrying out the
action referred to by the predicate, while when using the term instrumental construc-
tion I also include the relations these elements hold with the verb and the constraints
and characteristics – both syntactical and semantic – that these relations establish.
I will propose an example to illustrate how the variation in the construction Â�
limits
the classification according to these theories. Considering the case I mentioned to prove
the behavior of non-causal instruments, (b) Juan sorbió la sopa con la cuchara [Juan
sipped the soup with the spoon], it is clear that con la cuchara plays the semantic role of
utensil instrument or non-causal instrument (very similar to secondary tools proposed
by Schlesinger in his initial classification, to say the least). But, is the spoon a secondary
tool or utensil-instrument per se? If the sentence is reformulated as in (c) Juan removió
la sopa con la cuchara [Juan stirred the soup with the spoon], we must admit that con la
cuchara now plays the role of tool or causal instrument, and is the direct second cause
of the verbal action and the semantic subject. The limitation of the classification accord-
ing to the whole construction is clear. Therefore, these classifications, just like the one
I will propose later on for instrumental denominal verb formations, do not intend to
classify instruments, but instrumental constructions, which are different in analytical
and synthetic formations, just as they themselves are different.
There are two specific problems that, in my opinion, are derived from applying
theories regarding instrument in analytical constructions to a corpus of synthetic
Â�
formations, ignoring the differences existing between the two constructions.
Firstly, and according to Schlesinger’s initial classification, there is a clear delimi-
tation conflict, both excessive and lacking. Most instruments that lead to denominal
verb formations belong to the conglomerate that the author includes as “tools”; this
category is, in my opinion, extremely broad and completely heterogeneous and does
not contribute much to the classification of the semantic process we are trying to
Â�
analyze. Furthermore, there are cases of verbs that seem, a priori, to present a similar
conceptualization process and that are separated by Schlesinger in different groups;
such is the case of patear < pata [to kick < leg] and aporrear < porra [to bat < bat],
that would be included according to this classification under “body parts” and “tools”,
respectively, both conflating a scene of the “to hit with [instrument]” type.
Secondly, if we look at the most widespread classification between “causal” and
“non-causal” formations, it seems that this separation is not productive in instrumen-
tal denominal verb formation, since an astounding majority of the cases registered in
the corpus correspond to instrumental constructions that present the CAUSE feature.
Therefore, the discrimination regarding this characteristic could lead us to the point
of not classifying anything because all the samples belong to the same group. Clearly
different examples like flagelar < flagelo [to whip < whip], that express an action of
the “golpear con un flagelo” [to hit with a whip] type, and pincelar < pincel [to brush
< brush], which, to a certain extent, conceptualizes a locative process similar to
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ³ïœ±
that of verbs that Levin (1993) labels “of image impression”, would both be included
Â�
indifferently as causal formations.
For all these reasons, and due to the fact that this study is focused on the Â�formation
process of these verbs and not the result of this process, I think it is necessary to pay
some attention to the categorization of instrumental denominal verb formations from
a different classification model to that applied to analytical cases. Nevertheless, I would
like to highlight that I do not, by any means, intend to discredit Schlesinger and Conti’s
proposals, but aim to make it clear that, in agreement with Cifuentes (1999, 2006a),
I believe that analytical and synthetic realizations, although related in their origin,
are different constructions and, therefore, should be approached from different
Â�
perspectives in order to observe the particularities of this phenomenon.
3.â•… 
An alternative proposal: A conceptual model
In my opinion, the constitution of a model to classify cases of instrumental Â�
denominal
verbalization should consider two fundamental aspects that characterize this kind
of structures: on the one hand, the very nature of the construction, a product of the
Â�
process I have mentioned as conceptual conflation; on the other hand, the idea I have
tried to convey in the previous sections regarding the need to distinguish instruments
and instrumental constructions.
The characteristic I consider fundamental in these formations is their constitution
from a conceptual conflation process, which implies the creation of a new complex unit,
i.e. the denominal verb, which includes various contents within itself: in the case of the
specific schema that is the object of my study, instruments and actions Â�performed with
these contents (although I consider that not all conflations that include instruments
belong to the group of instrumental formations). Thus, the model I propose bears in
mind that the formations subject to classification are complex constructions of which
the instrument is merely a part.
Furthermore, I believe that it is of vital importance that the model aiming to
classify these units distinguishes instruments from instrumental constructions. As
I already said in the previous section, I believe that not all conflations that contain an
instrument constitute an instrumental denominal verb formation. Bearing in mind not
the verbs, but their formation processes, and given the analyzes performed up to now,
I think it is possible to state that the instrumental pattern bears a close Â�
relation with,
at least, one other pattern proposed by Cifuentes (1999, 2006a): the local Â�
pattern. This
statement may seem somewhat bold, but I think that this link between Â�
localization
and instrumentality is not random, but is focused on the very nature of the instrument
that must be located in space and time in order to be used. This way, some confla-
tions that include instruments are local instrument conflations, and not instrumental
ïœ³ïœ²	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
constructions; hence, the importance of the explicative model distinguishes between
instruments and instrumental constructions, since although the verb does suggest ‘use
of an instrument’, the process through which it has been formed may be local, causing
classification problems such as those already mentioned by Sala (1996:â•›111).
Thus, what I propose is to create a classification of these formations from a
Â�semantic-conceptual model where the important element is not the verb itself; that is,
whatIaminterestedininthisclassificationareconceptualizationprocessesÂ�represented
by the verbs; i.e. how the instrument takes part in the conflation with the predicate
and what type of scene is conceptualized in it. In short, this study focuses on Â�analyzing
the formation of denominal verbs according to formation patterns of a semantic-Â�
conceptual kind. For example, any entry in which a locative process takes place where
the instrument is used to situate the base of localization will be Â�
classified in the same
group, since they respond to a similar syntactic and semantic Â�
behavior (same syntac-
tic structure, same structural alternations, etc.) as pointed out by Â�
Cifuentes (2008),
where he states that: verbs that share the same meaning components belong to the same
semantic type and have the same syntactic behavior. Moving back to the questions
I considered regarding instrument classification proposals in analytical constructions
by Conti and Schlesinger, indeed, the lexical nature of the nouns that act as the base
of conflation are important in this model, but not on the same line as Schlesinger,
but insofar as they condition the relation with the predicate and establish certain
Â�
semantic and structural constraints. Similarly, the classification depends on the con-
struction, and one same instrument can lead to different samples, but this is not
important Â�
bearing in mind that what we are aiming for is the classification of instru-
mental constructions, that is, of these complex denominal verb formations, and not
of independent instruments.
The analysis of the 130 samples that compose the corpus I worked with in this
investigation allowed me to see that instrumental formations seem to present a strong
relation with locative formations. As I warned above, it is possible for this relation to
lie in the very nature of the instrument, which must be situated in time and space in
order for another element of the sentence – prototypically the agent – to use it. This
fact also adds certain consistency to the explicative model, allowing us to see the rela-
tions between different conceptual patterns that compose it like a network of indistinct
categories with contact spaces between them.
Bearing in mind this link between instrumentality and localization and the
aspects of the semantic-conceptual model I proposed earlier, I established an initial
classification of instrumental denominal verb formations in three groups according to
the degree of localization of the derivation base.
Firstly, we would have those formations where the instrument is limited to the
minimum localization associated to that category, that is, its localization in the agent.
It is the case of instruments that do not force the verbal action on the patient, but that
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ³ïœ³
are formed according to a pattern where the agent makes use of the instrument and it,
in turn, allows the performance of the verb and receives it. Such is the case of trompe-
tear < trompeta [to trumpet < trumpet]. Clearly in this formation the instrument must
be situated in the agent’s time and space in order for it to be able to perform the verbal
action, but this action does not affect any element beyond the instrument itself, which
as well as assisting the agent, receives the action, since the agent acts upon the trumpet.
The second group is composed of those verbs that can present local conceptual-
ization but where the instrument does not participate as a localization element; that
is, the agent carries out a locative action, a motion, a situation or the removal of the
patient (figure of the local process) using the instrument to do so. The instrument only
takes part in the localization as a localising entity; that is, as the second cause of the
localization. We can see an example in the case of traspalar < pala [to shovel < shovel].
Here, the instrument, conflated with the action of motion, is used by the agent to act
upon the patient element that works as the direct object and constitutes the figure of
the locative process (el obrero traspaló la arena [the builder shoveled the sand]. Thus
the shovel participates in the localization process, but remains outside the components
of the motion schema (Talmy 2000).
Lastly, a third group would be composed of those cases that also suggest a Â�locative
process but where the instrument does take part in the process, acting as the located
element. In this group we find cases such as aporrear < porra [to bat < bat], where
a locative process takes place together with an instrumental process and where the
instrument stands as the located figure or object. So, not only does it Â�
participates in
the locative process, but also constitutes one of the integrating Â�
elements, since what
occurs is an instrument localization in a given way and with a specific aim and result.
Starting from the idea that these semantic patterns are not static groups but fuzzy
categories, this last kind would be on the limit of instrumentality, bordering with local
conflations, all that separates them being the preeminence that the instrumental action
has over the local process.
These general groups gather a varied number of cases and, as I mentioned previ-
ously, greatly limited due to lexical aspects of the formation base. This means that each
of them can present distinctive elements that I will try to explain below.
3.1â•… Unergative instruments
The group mentioned in first place, characterized by their implicit localization within
the agent, is what I have labelled unergative instrumental constructions or of unergative
instrument. This label is determined by the type of syntactic structure all the compo-
nents of this group show; formations included in this group present an intransitive
syntactic structure with an agent subject, where the instrument is conflated with the
verb and requires no further complements.
ïœ³ïœ´	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
Within this group I have distinguished two subgroups. On the one hand, we have
the so-called sound instruments; this type of conflation is composed of instruments
that produce – or can be used to produce – sounds and noises, musical instruments
being the prototypical element, as in the case of trompetear < trompeta [to Â�
trumpet
< trumpet], in the sense of “to play the trumpet”, or tamborilear < tamboril [to drum
< drum], “to play the drums”. The conceptualization scene is of the “X plays Y” type,
where X is the agent and Y is the instrument, and the concept “to play” refers to
Â�
producing a sound.
Within this subgroup we can find cases in which the conceptualization using “to
play” is more complex; these are cases in which the instrument is not a prototypical
musical instrument, although the conceptualization is still of sound instruments. Such
is the case of tabletear < tabla/tableta [to produce sound with planks < plank], where
the scene presented is “to make noise with planks” and where we must understand a
hypothetical “to play the planks”, or chancletear < chancla/chancleta [to flip flop < flip
flop] which means “to make noise with flip flops”. Nevertheless, the difference between
the two cases can be found at a comparative level with the analytical realization of
these constructions; a construction such as “he played the trumpet” as opposed to
“he trumpeted” implies an argument reduction that does not occur in other cases.
Â�
However, focusing my interest on synthetic formations, for now I will consider that
both prototypical sound instruments and non-prototypical ones follow the same
Â�
formation procedure and constitute a uniform class.
The other subgroup within unergative instruments is what I have labelled
Â�conflations of object or patient instrument. Logically, these formations are also
intransitive and present a subject agent, typical of the general group they belong to.
The verbs included in this group present heterogeneous meanings although all of
them can be reduced to the “X uses or handles Y” pattern, where X is the agent and Y
again represents the instrument, and the concept of using can be understood as the
application of the prototypical action carried out with the corresponding Â�instrument
in each case.
The label of this subgroup is given by the role of the instrument within the
Â�
structure; since the verbal action does not affect a patient, the instrument assumes
this action, i.e. the agent uses the instrument to complete the action of the predicate
and the instrument also, somehow, receives this action – is the object of the action. In
a case like latiguear < látigo [to whip < whip], the conceptual base scene is “to use or
crack the whip”; the agent uses the whip as an instrument that allows it to perform the
action, but the instrument also receives the action of the agent, since it does not go
towards a patient, but finishes with mere use of the instrument.
In spite of this separation I included in previous investigations and that I have
repeated here, I believe that, not having further proof, it is very likely that the subgroup
of sound instruments is in fact simply a very productive lexical group within object
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ³ïœµ
or patient instruments (it has 22 of the 130 cases in total, whereas only 13 examples
have been classified as object instruments), since their structures seem to coincide.
Cases such as the one seen in trompetear have the same pattern as floretear < florete
[to fence < foil], for example, which can be paraphrased as “to use or brandish a foil”.
Both structures can be reduced to an X ACTION Y construction, where X is the agent,
Y the instrument, and the action would be diversified by the derivation base (“to play”
in trompetear and “to blandish” in floretear).

3.2â•… Localization instruments
The second group is composed of formations that conceptualize a scene where the
instrument participates in the localization process, but from an external position.
That is, it acts as a localising element that the agent uses to carry out the locative
process. These constructions are clearly instrumental and cannot be confused with
locative conflations by any means, since the instrument does not correspond to any
element from the localization or motion schema proposed by Talmy (2000), but acts
as a Â�
second cause of the action.
These constructions present a transitive structure in almost all subgroups, since
the localization is made broader compared to unergative instruments and the action
affects a patient object that is usually a figure of the locative process and acts as a direct
object.
Within this type there are five subgroups, three of which represent dynamic
Â�
processes and two are related to situation or removal processes.
The first group includes what I call motion instruments. These constructions
respond to a conceptual conflation that could be expressed as “X moves Z with Y”,
where, again, X represents the agent, Y is the instrument and Z is now the object
moved, the figure of motion. An example of this type can be found in acarrear < carro
[to cart < cart] with the conflation “to move or carry with a cart”, although at present
its meaning has been broadened, which is frequent in instrumental constructions in
general.
ïœ³ïœ¶	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
This type of conceptualization is characterized by presenting typical elements
from dynamic locative processes or of motion, assuming the possibility of introducing
complements that express the origin and/or goal of the movement (Juan acarreó los
bultos desde el almacén hasta la furgoneta [Juan carted the packages from the store to
the van]).
Within this subgroup I have also decided to include verbs that conflate means
of transport, although means are not instruments, strictly speaking. As pointed out
by Conti (2004:â•›
176–177), the most significant difference between the two is the
Â�
assignment of semantic roles. While instruments establish a relation of possession
with the agent (X is in Y), means are characterized by posing a relation of container
(Y is in X). This difference implies some variations in the syntactic-semantic structure
between instruments and means of transport, since means do not present transitive
structures, but intransitive, due to the subject assuming the role of the figure of the
local process. In this situation we find examples like patinar < patín [to skate < skates],
with a paraphrase like “to move or go on skates”; in this case, the element moved
is the subject itself, which is also the agent of the action of patinar, as opposed to
motion instruments, where the figure of localization acts as the direct object, and the
Â�
construction presents one more argument.
Nevertheless, the inclusion of means of motion in the subgroup of motion
Â�
instruments is justified, I think, bearing in mind that the classification model I use
is based on the denominal verb formation process. In my opinion, this implies great
Â�
similarities between formations with instruments and formations with means of
motion, which is why I think it is appropriate to deal with them jointly.
As regards this first group I propose a second classification labelled Â�
constructions
with movement instrument. Their relation to the motion subgroup is wide, but Â�syntactic
and semantic constraints lead me to consider them a separate group.
They also plan movement, though it is not directional, but occurs in a restricted
space or area. Therefore, formations included in this group limit the appearance of
complements that indicate origin or goal of motion, since they are not clearly defined.
Also, they appear to simplify the use of these absolute uses of the verb, occurring in
intransitive structures and focusing their attention on the verbal action as opposed to
its application on the object.
We can use as examples of this subgroup cases such as cacear < cazo [to ladle <
ladle], hurgonear < hurgón [to poke < poker] or muletear < muleta,6 where the instru-
ment is used to carry out the movement of another element, though it is not of a direc-
tional kind, but occurs within an area.
ïœ¶.â•… Muleta in bullfighting is a stick with a red cape attached which the bullfighter uses to
distract the bull. Muletear means to distract the bull with the red cape.
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ³ïœ·
The third and final subgroup within dynamic localizations processes corresponds
to what I have labelled communication instruments. Here, a process of psychological
transference occurs, where the sender sends a message using an instrument, that is,
“X transmits Z with Y”. Some examples could be telefonear < teléfono [to telephone
< telephone] or telegrafear < telégrafo [to telegraph < telegraph], included in the Â�corpus,
although there are also examples such as faxear < fax [to fax < fax].
Together with these subgroups, within localization instruments, I have also
included cases referred to as addition instruments or of image impression. These verbs
are configured through a local process in which the object does not move, as such, but
is incorporated into the localization base, hence the name of this class. Therefore, this
type of formations presents a situational locative pattern that is conceptualized as “X
places Z with Y”, as in the case of cincelar < cincel [to chisel < chisel].
In these structures the localization figure, the ground or both can be actualized
leading to structural alternations of a local kind such as those proposed by Levin
(1993) and Cifuentes (2006b) regarding verbs of image impression and local processes
(el escultor cinceló la roca [the sculptor chiselled the rock], cinceló su firma [chiselled
his signature], cinceló su firma en la roca [chiselled his signature into the rock], cinceló
la roca con su firma [chiselled the rock with his signature]).
Lastly, if the possibility of conceptualising addition exists it must be possible to
conceptualize the inverse process; this type of structure is revealed by constructions
with a removal instrument. Within this group there are verbs that refer to actions of
cleaning, emptying or scrubbing (in the sense of scraping), all of which imply friction
upon an object that gets worn or removes something from a surface. For example,
cepillar < cepillo [to brush < brush], limar <lima [to file < file] or rasquetar < rasqueta
[to scrape < scraper].

ïœ³ïœ¸	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
Being a similar process to the one seen in verbs with an instrument of addition,
but in the opposite way, instrumental conflations of removal present similar character-
istics, and are also able to express either the element removed or the object from which
it is removed, or both notions according to a series of locative structural alternations
(cepilló el traje [he brushed the suit], cepilló la pelusa [he brushed the fluff], cepilló la
pelusa del traje [he brushed the fluff off the suit]. cepilló el traje de pelusa [he brushed
the suit of fluff]).
3.3â•… Contact instruments
The last group in the classification is composed of those verbs that are closest to the
process of local conflation (which can also occasionally integrate instruments). This
category includes formations that present a local conflation where the Â�
instrument
does take part in the localization process. I am talking about constructions that pose
a Â�
double locative-instrumental conflation in which I believe their formation has
Â�
followed an instrumental pattern and the localization is secondary or is governed by
the instrumental nature of the construction.
I have labelled this group contact instruments, since the scenes they conceptualize
imply previous contact with the patient object which, generally, acts as a direct object
and plays the role of ground or localization base, meaning these verbs present transi-
tive structures.
I have divided this group into two subgroups that differ for reasons related to the
duration of the process.
First come the cases I call punctual contact instruments. This category includes
verbs with meanings related to actions of impact, puncturing or piercing; that is, verbs
formed from the patterns “X hits Z with Y”, “X injures or kills Z with Y” or “X punc-
tures or pierces Z with Y”.
This group is by far the most numerous of the general classification presented,
taking up almost a third with its 41 samples in our corpus. These are cases such as
flagelar < flagelo [to whip < whip], banderillear < banderilla7 or taladrar < taladro [to
drill < drill].
If we observe a local conceptualization, it shows typical elements of the construc-
tions we are looking at, such as those we can see in local conflations. The difference
is that the localized figure or element is an instrument that plays an instrumental role
within the verbal action. Using the example of flagelar, it can be paraphrased as “to hit
something/someone with a whip” but it seems clear that there is also some relation
ïœ·.â•… In bullfighting, banderilla is a stick the bullfighter uses to stab into the bull’s back.
Â�
Banderillear means to stab these sticks into the bull’s back.
	 Instrumental verb formation	 ïœ³ïœ¹
with “to put the whip on someone”, although it implies localising it very specifically,
with a certain degree of violence, and to produce an injury caused by impact.
It is also typical of these constructions to allow structural alternations of a
Â�
local-partitive kind, which present a double holistic or partitive Â�
interpretation, i.e.
they can propose a structure in which the object upon which the action is Â�
performed
is dealt with as a whole, considering it as a direct object with a noun complement (el
verdugo flageló la espalda del reo [the executioner whipped the prisoner’s back]); or
the contact can be applied only to a part, introducing a local complement (el verdugo
flageló al reo en la espalda [the executioner whipped the prisoner on the back]).
In order to bring the classification to an end, I have grouped together those cases
that propose a lasting contact instrument, which includes those formations with a
Â�
contact instrument that imply actions of holding and cutting.
As regards the characteristics of this subgroup, they seem to coincide greatly
with instruments of punctual contact, meaning they compose a uniform category.
Â�
Nevertheless, their components express an action that can be considered by speakers
as a more dynamic and less instantaneous process. This feature implies a variation as
regards the structural alternations I proposed in the previous subgroup.

local-partitive
kind that are present in all of this group act as shown earlier. Â�
Nevertheless, these verbs
prefer the introduction of a partitive element using the preposition por, as opposed
to en, more frequently used with punctual contact instruments. Realization with en
is not grammatically incorrect, but it appears that the tendency towards por is justi-
fied by the greater dynamism of the construction (tijereteó la manga de la camisa/
tijereteó la camisa por la manga [he chopped the shirt sleeve/he chopped the shirt at
the sleeve]). In addition to this fact, we must add that constructions with a punctual
ïœ´ïœ°	 Javier Bolaños Navalón
contact instrument do not allow the complement introduced by por with the partitive
meaning, since its presence transmits the origin of the action or position of the agent
(acuchilló a Pedro en la espalda/acuchilló a Pedro por la espalda [he stabbed Pedro in
the back/he stabbed Pedro from the back]).
4.â•… Conclusions
In this paper I have sought to convey the complexity of dealing with the phenomenon
of denominal verbalization from various perspectives in order to explain, in a more
detailed fashion, the magnitude of this phenomenon.
I believe the problems mentioned regarding the application of the explanatory
proposals of instrumental constructions – which I have labelled analytical – to the
corpus of synthetic constructions I have used, justify the need to present a new pro-
posal capable of adapting to the different reality of these formations. The common
conceptual origin between analytical and conceptual structures makes certain explan-
atory elements coincide. Nevertheless, if our aim is to list the constitutive processes
of instrumental denominal verb formations, I believe it is vital to bear in mind the
distinction between instrument and instrumental construction, as well as the process
of conceptual conflation found in the very heart of these constructions.

The proposal made, starting from a semantic-conceptual classification of confla-
tion processes that take place in these verbs and summarized in Table 4, seems to cover
the samples gathered in the corpus. However, I must highlight that it is a temporary
classification, subject to modifications; denominal verb formations in general and the
instrumental formation pattern in particular require further attention and, for future
investigations, will need this initial proposal to be outlined in order to explain this
linguistic phenomenon more precisely.

Conflation processes in the formation
of Spanish verbs with a prepositional object*
José Antonio Candalija Reina
University of Alicante
This chapter analyzes prepositional denominal verbs; specifically, it focuses on
the importance of prepositions in the formation process of certain denominal
verbs from a diachronic perspective, paying attention to their origin and their
syntactic and semantic evolution. The paper outlines the local hypothesis
supporting the formation of prepositional denominal verbs; that is, it justifies
the semantic, syntactic and morphological conflation shown by these verbs in
terms of a local metaphor, since all the examined examples present a conflation
process that is based on a motion schema. This local-based schema selects certain
prepositions which anchor the location or the direction in which the event is
carried out.
Keywords:â•‡ prepositional denominal verbs; diachronic perspective; local
hypothesis; conflation
1.â•… Introduction
The last investigations about the syntax-semantics interface show a tendency to explain
the formation of denominal verbs from a synchronic point of view. Thus, Cifuentes
Honrubia (2006) and Serrano-Dolader (1999:â•›4685–4686), among others, have stated
that the group of verbs derived from previous bases can also include more recent verbs
interpreted as such today, although this could be in conflict with a historic perspective
of this process. Similarly, Varela (1993:â•›21) showed a state of morphological investiga-
tion in which there was a clear distinction between synchronic and diachronic facts,
the cessation of etymological disquisitions and a special attention drawn to semantic
and pragmatic motivation in lexical creation. Nevertheless, we think that our work,
which starts from the syntactic and semantic origins and evolution of the formation of

denominal verbs with an obligatory prepositional object, can contribute to Â�completing
the diachronic perspective and can integrate a more specific vision of the presence
of the preposition in these verbs, from both a historic and cognitive point of view. In
addition, it is very important to mention that this process has not been – and cannot
be – exempt of the meaning with which the various prepositional senses provide it.
Therefore, in first place we shall study the configuration of denominal verbs and then
the subgroup of denominal verbs in which there is a morphological correspondence
between prefix and preposition. We shall continue with the explanation of the local
base which is the source of the formation of this subgroup, in which it is possible to
track the original noun from which the verb derives metaphorically. We shall conclude
with the analysis of a small group of verbs and their obligatory prepositions.
2.â•… 
Argument structure of denominal verbs with a local base
The importance of semantic relations in the analysis of complex structures has been
highlighted in various studies. Piera and Varela (1999:â•›4386) recognize that if the core
of a word is a predicate (and the analytical construction of these verbs proves it), it
could appear with semantically required arguments. For this reason we can study the
semantic and syntactic relations between the morphological constituents of some
words from the point of view of the argument structure theory (Moreno Cabrera 1997,
2001; Mateu 1997, 2001, 2002; Hale & Keyser 1993, 1997). Firstly, argument structure
was understood as the set of arguments of a predicate, represented by labels of Â�thematic
functions, and included both subcategorized complements or inner Â�
arguments and
the subject of the predicate or external argument (Williams 1981). This definition
tended to identify the argument structure with the thematic structure, because the
argument structure was understood as an auxiliary tool for representing the thematic
functions which are assigned to the syntactic constituents. However, Grimshaw (1990)
Â�distinguished both structures by giving them autonomy, because they provide different
information for the projection of lexical units. Hale and Keyser (1999), in turn, consid-
ered that argument structure is the syntactic configuration projected by a Â�
lexical unit.
It is a system formed by structural relations that are established between the cores and
their arguments, as a part of their position in the lexicon. According to the Â�
number of
arguments, these authors established the following types of verbs:
a.	
Anadic: without arguments. Meteorological verbs, like llover [rain]or tronar
[thunder].
b.	
Monadic: with only one argument. Intransitive verbs, like dormir [sleep] or llegar
[arrive].
c.	 Dyadic: with two arguments. Transitive verbs, like comer [eat] or temer [fear].
d.	 Triadic: with three arguments. For example: dar [give], recibir [receive].
	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœ´ïœµ
For Hale and Keyser the main external argument is the AGENT and sometimes the
CAUSE and the INSTRUMENT. The inner basic argument is the THEME, but they
consider that the UNDERGOER, GOAL, LOCATIVE and SOURCE area also inner
arguments.
Levin and Rappaport (2005) give the label argument realization to the study of
the possible syntactic expressions of the arguments of a verb. They refer to all the
Â�
facets of syntactic expressions of verb arguments, including the whole set of options
of the grammatical relations which their syntactic category and their morphosyntactic
expression can imply.
In this context, they also underline that the verbal senses represent linguistic
constructions of the extralinguistic world. Thus, the theories both of lexical semantic
representations and argument realization must be designed to arrange variation and
uniformity patterns of argument realization. So, we can determinate which elements
of meaning are relevant for the projection from lexical semantics towards morphosyn-
tactic expression.1
The distinction between transitivity and intransitivity in these verbs is relevant to
determining the argument pattern or argument structure, since we are dealing with
verbs that require an argument prepositional object. Several authors have talked about
the concept of transitivity which is applied to these argument constructions; how-
ever, we think that the point is that we must define the prepositional meaning of these
constructions as an element which allows us to distinguish the type of transitivity in
which these verbs are included. Thus, we assume the concept of prepositional transitiv-
ity (transitividad preposicional) which has been used by Alarcos (1968), Cano Aguilar
(1981), Gutiérrez Araus (1987), Hernanz and Brucart (1987) or García-Miguel (1995).
Each transitive construction implies a directionality which comes from an AGENT and
goes towards a THEME/PATIENT (Langacker 1991). In this case, verbs with a prepo-
sitional object are mostly dyadic, since they require two arguments, which in turn can
be metaphorically conceived as the two poles of a local pattern of directionality.
Our investigation assumes that verbs which require prepositional objects can be
explained from a localist hypothesis, as Lyons (1972), Anderson (1971, 1997), Moreno
Cabrera (2003) or Delancey (1991) propose. We also follow the recent contributions
which take into account the metaphorically based grammaticalization processes that
analyze the abstract use of local prepositions (Melis 2003; Goyens, Lamiroy & Melis
2003; Fagard 2003, 2006; Candalija Reina 2008). Therefore, we understand that the
basic arguments in verbs that use local prepositions are three: AGENT (OR CAUSE),
ïœ±.â•… Levin and Rappaport (2005) understand that the list of semantic roles is not accurate in
the consideration of the components of meaning which determinate argument realization.
They consider, on the contrary, that what is necessary is a lexical semantic representation
which codifies the properties of the events.
ïœ´ïœ¶	 José Antonio Candalija Reina
THEME and LOCATIVE. We have applied the localist hypothesis and fictive motion
(Talmy 2000) in order to identify the AGENT (or CAUSE) with the SOURCE and the
LOCATIVE with the GOAL, leading us to three directional locally based patterns:
a.	 ABLATIVE: the THEME becomes the SOURCE: alardeaba de sus premios
[he bragged about his awards].
b.	 ADLATIVE: THEME or LOCATIVE becomes GOAL: apestas a pescado
[you stink ofâ•›2 fish].
c.	 UBI: LOCATIVE becomes GOAL: confío en tu honestidad [I trust in your honesty].
These patterns can be analyzed by means of the concept of incorporation or Â�conflation
in word formation processes in which the base is a noun. That is why we have
included these verbs in the analysis of denominal verbs with a local base (Cifuentes
Honrubia 2006).
Talmy (1985:â•›
62) in his analysis of motion conceptually isolated the elements
of Â�
figure, motion, direction, ground and manner/cause, but these elements can
be expressed linguistically by means of a verbal conflation (Cifuentes Honrubia
1999:â•›123). Talmy′s conflation concept can have similarities with the incorporation
phenomenon, as it is understood by Mardirussian (1975), Dik (1980), Mithun (1984),
Lazard (1984), Baker (1988), Wotjak (1990) or Moreno Cabrera (1991). Talmy himself
(2000) Â�
establishes a localization pattern in which movement consists of the following
elements: Â�
figure, ground, path and motion (or localization). In this pattern, the figure
acts as an object that moves, or which is localized in relation with another object, which
is considered as the ground. The figure follows a path or direction towards the ground
object. As regards motion, or localization, Talmy understands it as the presence per
se in the event of motion or localization. The grammatical specification of figure and
ground is a noun, whereas the path is usually prepositional or relational, and verbs
express motion or localization. This pattern stands for displacement and localization
Â�
altogether, because the absence of motion is understood as stillness, and the path as
the prepositional marker which establishes the local relationship between figure and
ground, when we talk about analytical construction. Synthetic constructions – that
is, denominal verbs – reflect the local relationship by means of prefixes or, if there is
no prefix, we must contextually presuppose it. So in this sense, we aim to analyze this
local relationship, although it is metaphorical, by studying the relation between the
Â�
analytical and the synthetic form of these verbs. Thus, we will prove the relevance of
the prefix or the preposition in determining the underlying local relationship.
ïœ².â•… Note that in English the construction is not adlative,so I believe that verb to stink governs
the ABLATIVE and chooses, consequently, the preposition of, which marks the source of
the smell.

3.â•… 
Preposition and prefix
The possible equivalence between analytical and synthetic constructions of Â�denominal
verbs has been questioned by several authors (Serrano-Dolader 1995:â•›
107ff;
1999:â•›4710ff; Gerdts 1998:â•›86). However, others, like Hale and Keyser, do not intend
to derive the denominal verb from the analytical form; they only suggest knowing
the argument structure of these verbs, because both forms, the analytical and the
synthetic Â�
structures, are related by this argument structure which allows them to
share certain properties. Thus, we start from an analysis of the argument structure
of these verbs which avoids equalling the meaning of synthetic construction with the
meaning of analytical Â�
construction and evades the criticism on the analysis of lexical
Â�
decomposition made by generative semantics.
In this sense, the study of the argument structure of denominal verbs poses
another problem, which has been discussed recently by some authors as regards the
equivalence between the prefix of these verbs and the preposition in the analytical
Â�
construction. As Cifuentes Honrubia (2006) states, we do not intend to create an
equivalence between the sense of the prepositions and the sense of the prefixes. We
simply want to show that both can express a relational local content. Such content
can be coincident in many cases on a conceptual level, and this can be a semantic
trail in the understanding of the denominal verb.3 The understanding of the sense of
the prefix is, in Cifuentes Honrubia’s view, conceptual, like the relationship between
the elements of figure and ground, forming the conceptual structure of the verb are
determined by the sense of the relation between the localizing object and the localized
object. Thus, if the verb appears with a prefix, this implies an extraordinary help for
the understanding of the local relation, even if there is no equality between the sense
of the prefix and the preposition’s sense (2006). Our point of view is the same, but
we must specify that the meaning of the verb may have semantically evolved from its
original formation, and that this process itself in the base lexicon (not derived from a
language, as Cifuentes Honrubia states). If so, it can be concluded that we are dealing
with diachronic phenomena, which develop across the evolution of languages, but also
in a certain synchronic stage.
In the configuration of the argument structure of denominal verbs we assume the
integral point of view of Labelle (1992, 2000): she postulates the relationship between
ïœ³.â•… Coseriu (1977) talked about paragrammatical relation in order to explain formation
Â�
processes of deverbal nouns – and this can also be applied to denominal verbs – as the
Â�
relationship which is explicitly shown in the denominal verb; that is, its paraphrase belongs
to a formula of analytical function, i.e. metalinguistic function, and does not belong to a
primary linguistic fact. However, the syntactic uses of the noun are a point of reference for the
Â�
formation of the denominal verb.
ïœ´ïœ¸	 José Antonio Candalija Reina
their conceptual, morphological and argument structure. As the author says, we can
conclude that:
1.	 When the noun, from which the verb derives, describes a displaced entity, the
localization where this entity ends appears in the argument position of direct
object. In this case, a prepositional phrase can identify the displaced entity.
2.	 When the noun which is included in the verb describes localization, the entity
which is localized appears in the position of direct object. In the same manner, a
prepositional object can specify localization.
In this sense, we can talk about the difference between locatum/location verbs, as Clark
and Clark (1979) propose. They identify two types of denominal verbs: locatum [to
saddle] and location [to cage]. Matera and Medina (2005) believe that the preposition
included in the semantic construction of locatum/location verbs is a category that
Â�contains lexical semantic features, which contribute to the different perception between
these types of verbs. In the case of the Spanish enjaular [to cage], they say that the verb
has the meaning of [+ terminal inherent point] and that the preposition en [in] adds the
meaning of inner matter. Whereas in a locatum verb like ensillar [to saddle] the feature
is [–terminal inherent point] and the preposition en [on] emphasizes the surface, that
is, the saddle is put on the horse and not inside it. But in both cases the authors find not
only the underlying local structure, but also the object motion which goes from outside
to inside when we cage a bird or the change of place when we saddle a horse.
There are a lot of works that define what a denominal verb is in the processes of
word formation (Almela 1999). All agree on pointing out that a verb is denominal
because it has been formed from a noun base. But only a few consider in this process
the relevance of the preposition in the analytical construction. As Serrano-Dolader
(1995) says, this type of explanations can be useful for spatial prefixes, but we think
that in verbs with prepositional objects (which are more related to notional or abstract
senses) the presence of the preposition reveals that the conceptual incorporation or
conflation process in the formation of these denominal verbs is local or spatial, as we
shall justify later.

The theory of incorporation: Incorporation and conflation
The process in which the noun becomes a part of a verb as the core of a predicate with
its arguments is known as incorporation or conflation. But these terms are not synony-
mous; because, whereas incorporation has morphosyntactic consequences which are
materialized in the affected elements (‘premiar’, ‘dar un premio’ [to reward, to award a
prize to]), in conflation the morphosyntactic consequence is a loss of independence of
	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœ´ïœ¹
the blended elements, since a recategorization takes place. Since we are talking about
denominal verbs in which recategorization consists of the change from a noun into a
verb, and therefore, a variation in the meaning of the synthetic structure with regard
to the analytical form, it would be advisable to use the term conflation to refer to the
verbs we are dealing with: in the verb abusar de [to abuse of] we can see that there is
conflation of the analytical expression hacer abuso de [to take advantage of], in which
we observe the recategorization of the noun into a verb.
According to the theory of incorporation, the incorporated element restricts one
of the thematic arguments of the predicate. Thus, if the implicated element is the figure
or ground, these must not appear again; or if the incorporated element is the prepo-
sition, the ground will be attached directly to the verb by means of a prefix. So the
preposition is not necessary. However, Cifuentes Honrubia (2006) warns that it is not
always possible to demonstrate the semantic relation between the simple word and the
derived word, because it may have been lost or the original meaning may have been
changed. In that case, it would be necessary to specify the incorporated element. In
sentences like
	(1)	
Engrasó la puerta con aceite de coche [He greased the door with car oil].
	(2)	
El barco encalló entre las rocas [The ship got stranded on the rocks].
the relation between the incorporated noun and the syntactic argument is a
Â�
subspecification relationship, since the syntactic argument specifies, settles or details a
specific type of the incorporated noun – always more generic – in a semantic relation
of hyperonymy/hyponymy: car oil is a type of grease and the rocks simulate a type of
street (narrow place)4 in which the ship is stranded and cannot go on.
In these sentences the local base is evident. However, Cifuentes Honrubia (2006)
shows a case in which the metaphorical-metonymical relation explains the supposed
lack of motivation in the semantic link between the simple word and the derived word:
	 (3)	
Se enredó entre/con tanto artículo [He got tangled/got into a tangle with so
many articles].
The semantic relation between “localization in red [net/mesh]” and “got into a mess/
muddle, to get mixed up” is made by means of the metaphor which implies that tanto
artículo [so many articles] is the argument conceived as a place where the action of the
verb occurs (entre, [between]), or as the circumstance which causes it (con, [with]).
Therefore, according to our hypothesis, the argument would correspond with the
Â�
thematic role of THEME/GOAL (preposition entre, [between]) or with the thematic
role of SOURCE/CAUSE (preposition con, [with]), and we can also understand that
ïœ´.â•… In Spanish the verb encallar derives from the noun calle [street].
ïœµïœ°	 José Antonio Candalija Reina
there is a directionality of the verbal action either in an adlative sense (entre, between)
or in an ablative sense (con, with).
Therefore, in contexts in which the verb is not locally conceived (se enredó con la
explicación [he complicated the explanation]), as Cifuentes Honrubia states (2006:â•›8, 10),
it wouldbepossibletopostulate,fromalocalistpointof view, thatthelocal baseunderlies
the argument structure of this type of verbs in which the supposed Â�
different Â�
meaning of
enredarse en/con el artículo [to get tangled with the article] and the Â�
meaning of se enredó
con la explicación [he complicated the explanation] have in common the Â�
physical and
concrete meaning of ‘red’ [net/mesh], which is the core of the denominal verb Â�
enredarse
[to tangle/ get into a tangle].
In this sense, the analysis of verbs with an obligatory prepositional object that we
show here aims to demonstrate that there is a metaphorical/metonymical motivation
between the original meaning and the current meaning of these verbs. This motivation
allows us to understand these conflations in a local and directional sense. Both the study
of the relation between the synthetic structure and the analytical construction and the
sense of the incorporated prefix – in some cases, from a diachronic Â�
perspective – will
support this hypothesis.
According to this, Beniers says that “something which in incorporation seems
to correspond to a historic evolution (Mithun 1984), in derivation is a matter of
Â�
synchrony and can occur with the same word: the understanding of the base noun
as a participant in the main sentence and its understanding as an element from a
modal sentence”, and he also states that there are verbs which have become demo-
tivated or do not admit a literal use. This author affirms that the original use of
the verb Â�
almacenar [to store], ‘poner objetos en un almacén’ [to put objects into a
store] is understood currently as ‘guardar cualquier tipo de elementos, materiales
o Â�
inmateriales de manera sistemática y concentrada, con la idea de recuperarlos
en algún momento’ [to put away any type of element, material or immaterial, in a
Â�
systematic and concentrated Â�
manner in order to recover them at any moment]. She
also states that the locative sense is less perceptible than the modal sense: ‘sistemática-
mente’, ‘de manera concentrada’, ‘como en un Â�
almacén’ [systematic, in a concentrated
manner, as in a store] (Beniers 2002:â•›417).
From our perspective, which despite being localist does not intend to exclude
other explanations, we think that Beniers’ argument is incorrect, because none of
the nine senses which the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española (DRAE) gives
has the meaning of “in a systematic or concentrated manner”. On the contrary, this
dictionary gives local senses, such as ‘edificio o local donde se depositan géneros
de cualquier especie, generalmente mercancías’ [building or place where someone
leaves items, generally goods]. It is different if almacenar has lost its local sense, as
happens in the immaterial or abstract uses, to which Beniers refers. This is a meta-
phoric/metonymical process ruled by the semantic evolution of the noun in the field
	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœµïœ±
of computing, for example, where to store or file refers to a virtual store or file which
is located in a virtual place in the computer, and the manner in which it is located
is not essential.
5.â•… 
The compulsory nature of prepositions in denominal verbs
with a prepositional object
Nowadays there are a lot of studies which confirm the importance of the prepositional
meaning for semantic and syntactic investigations. But it is also necessary to take
into account this meaning for morphological works such as in word formation. The
so called particles (wrongly labelled, in our opinion) both in traditional and current
Spanish grammar have been studied in most cases from a syntactic, relational, point of
view, from which their meaning was reduced to the physical size of the small parts of
the sentence. On the contrary, we have demonstrated that their meaning is present in
many aspects, and that its local and directional sense can be studied not only in their
physical occurrences but also in abstract contexts.
Regardless of the interaction between the argument structure and conceptual
structure that we have studied before, we can see how the syntactic relations in the
sentence have certain correlation with semantic features in the verbs analyzed; because
the preposition that depends on a noun (and is governed by it) is blended with the
same noun to become a new verb in which the obligatory preposition is motivated by
the nominal obligatory character from which it derives (abusar de< ‘hacer abuso de’;
to abuse, ‘make abuse of’). And this motivation is not only justified by etymological
syntactic factors (ab usare), but also by the conceptual structure, which configures
the directional meaning of the preposition by means of the ablative sense in the verb
abusar and the nominal construction hacer abuso [make abuse], which requires the
preposition de [of] and no other.
But the noun cannot appear again with the verb meaning; that is, the Â�
analytical
expression and the synthetic expression are not synonymous. Therefore, it is a
Â�
conflation of elements (the noun and the Latin prefix/preposition) that avoids the
presence of the noun with the preposition:
	 (4)	
Abusó de su confianza [He abused of his confidence] (metaphorical source
point).
	(5)	
Abusó de la mujer [He abused of the woman] (physical source point).
	 (6)	*Hizo abuso de su confianza [*He made abuse of his confidence].
	 (7)	*Hizo abuso de la mujer [*He made abuse of the woman].5

Conflation processes in denominal verbs with an prepositional object
and a metaphorical locative sense
We analyzed a group of verbs that require a prepositional object in order to study the
obligatory preposition motivated, in most cases, by Latin etymology or their Romance
origin. Thus, we can prove that the Romance preposition appears because the Latin
verb includes a prefix/preposition which indicates a source or a goal (ablative or
Â�
adlative directionality). This diachronic fact supports the localist hypothesis, which
allows us to understand that abstract uses of the obligatory prepositional object have
a local sense because there is a metaphor in the conception of the thematic roles of
THEME/PATIENT from the local SOURCE/GOAL thematic arguments. The nominal
base of these conflations also confirms the localist hypothesis, as these nouns contain a
local component (uso; use in abusar; abuse requires a place, for example).
Abusar de: ‘hacer uso de’. Ablative directional sense.
The conceptual construction in this conflation hacer abuso (Cifuentes Honrubia
1999:â•›125) requires the preposition de in the same way as the nominal phrase abuso
de tu confianza [I take advantage of your trust]. So we use this preposition because we
need to mark the source of the ‘uso excesivo’ [excessive use], and, therefore, we need
an ablative preposition. There is also an etymological motivation, because the Latin
preposition ab appears as a prefix, supporting the source meaning of the Latin verb
abutor, from which abuso derives.
Ahorrar de/en: [to save/to spare] ‘hacer horro [libre] en’. Preposition governed by
the adlative and local sense of the verb ‘liberar, poner en libertad’ [to free].
Neither María Moliner (1996) nor Cuervo (1998) give the sense of ‘no gastar,
guardar’ [not to spend, to save] with the preposition en. However, both agree on the
directional sense which derives metaphorically in the role of THEME, expressed by
the preposition de. This metaphor is built on the original sense of horro [free], as Cor-
ominas states, in which we see the place from which there is a liberation, as there is no
obligation or duty to spend, just like a slave is free from his obligation of slavery. The
liberation of a state of slavery or spending gives freedom to access money or objects
owned and to put them in the desired place. Therefore, we choose the preposition en
to mark the place in which we want our freedom to reside. The configuration of the
THEME in ahorrar en relies on metaphorical derivation which goes from the cognitive
awareness of the location of the saved object in a safe place to the place in which the
object is free and can be saved. Thus, we can talk about the transitivity which underlies
the translation of the action from an AGENT to a THEME (metaphorical place).
Theprepositionenappearsin1616(CORDE),whereastheprepositiondeislocated
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, so we think that the original Â�
ablative sense
is changed in the next century by the adlative sense of en, which confirms that there is
a process of grammaticalization in which the construction changes its Â�
meaning from
	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœµïœ³
a local sense to an abstract sense by means of a metaphorical Â�
phenomenon Â�
(Goyens,
Lamiroy & Melis 2003).
Alardear de: [to boast about]‘hacer alarde de’. Ablative directional sense.
Alarde derives from the Arabic noun card,6 which also derives from the Arabic
verb cárad, meaning ‘to show’, which is essentially a deictic verb. We can consider that
the deictic character of this verb (and also the deictic sense of the derived noun) is
directional, since we assume that, when we show something, the object is understood
as a place or source from which we are showing it to people. This place is metaphori-
cally conceived as a THEME (assuming the abstract process of grammaticalization
which we perform using the localist hypothesis). So the ablative sense is clearly
exposed by this verb in Spanish, for it derives from a deictic directional verb in Arabic.
But we must explain also how the sense of ‘alardear, presumir, jactarse o vanaglo-
riarse’ [to boast, to brag, to show off] is derived from the sense of the noun alarde. If a
‘revista de tropas’ [review of troops] consists basically in showing the troops through
which a leader or chief shows off his military power and strength, it is easy to under-
stand that this specific sense is metaphorically translated to the abstract and current
sense of boast.7
And to confirm the ablative sense of this verb, we can study the analytical form
from which the conflation of the verb has been made, parting from the noun alarde.
In ‘hacer alarde de’ [to brag about] the preposition de is present because there is an
ablative sense, but also because the noun alarde requires this type of preposition in
this type of construction.
Apestar a: (to stink) ‘hacer peste a’ Adlative directional sense.
Maria Moliner states in her dictionary that this verb only appears with the third
grammatical person (she says that it is terciopersonal). We do not agree with this
Â�
syntactic appreciation, since it is possible to find an AGENT (person or object) which
can be expressed by other grammatical persons:
	(8)	
Apestas a tabaco [You stink of tobacco].
	(9)	
La habitación apesta a humo [The room stinks of smoke].
Fernández Jaén (2008) has analyzed the verb oler (to smell) in Spanish, the prototype
of the linguistic category of olfactory perception, and he states that apestar is a more
marked conceptualization from the basic pattern expressed by oler, in which the nuance
of ‘oler mal’ [to smell bad] is lexicalized.

ïœ·.â•… Note that in English the verb also chooses the preposition of.
ïœµïœ´	 José Antonio Candalija Reina
In the example from La Regenta, by Leopoldo Alas, the AGENT (don Saturno),
which matches the figure of this construction, carries out the verbal action as an
Â�
element of source from which the smell emanates and moves to the ground, which
is the THEME (brea, tar), the GOAL which is marked by the preposition a [to]. This
directional sense is also confirmed by the etymological sense in a metaphorical/Â�
metonymical manner, as the illness of peste bubonica [the bubonic plague] has an
essential feature which is the emission of an awful smell. In this sense, we can talk
about fictive motion (Talmy 1996:â•›212–213), and, more specifically, this type of motion
would match the so called goal directions:
	(10)	
El Infanzón estaba en rigor como en alta mar, y cada vez que oía decir la nave
del Norte, la nave del Sur, la nave principal, se creía al frente de una escuadra
y se figuraba que don Saturno apestaba a brea. Pero el pobre lugareño seguía
diciendo que sí a todo (CORDE).
A new metaphorical process of grammaticalization is shown in the example from
Ricardo Palma, who at the end of the nineteenth century chooses the concrete
noun miseria [poverty] as an abstract noun in which there are two senses altogether
(a kind of dilogy): the smell of dirtiness coming from his clothes (specific meaning)
and from the social status of poverty, related to bad smells through lack of hygiene and
Â�
cleanliness (abstract meaning):
	(11)	
Éralo de la de San Jerónimo un indio que apenas podía llevar a cuestas el
peso de su partida de bautismo, arrugado como pasa, nada aleluyado y que
apestaba a miseria a través de sus harapos (CORDE).
In addition, the etymological sense of the Latin pestis, from which apestar derives,
confirms the directional adlative sense, since the verb in Spanish would be formed by
the noun plus the Latin preposition ad (ad pestis), understanding that the THEME
(in the abstract sense) could be a kind of subspecification of the type of peste [stench],
which can also be found in the analytical form ‘hacer peste a’ [to release a stench of].
Confiar en: [to trust, to rely on]‘poner confianza en’ Adlative/ubi directional sense.
The presence of the preposition en is explained by the conception of a Â�
metaphorical
schemewhichconceives theverbalactionas amotionfromtheAGENTtoaGOALwhich
is the PATIENT (the ground). The figure is the abstract object (fides in Latin) which in
this case is a THEME. The motion is an ubicación [a location] and in this sense has some
directionality. The analytical form ‘poner confianza en’ [to put trust in]8 would be a clue
to understanding the presence of the preposition as an obligatory element of the verb.

	 2.â•… To trust confidently, be sure.
	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœµïœµ
Cristalizar en: [to crystallize] ‘convertirse en cristal’. Adlative/ubi directional
sense.
The locative sense of the preposition en turns into a modal sense as the verb localizes
the place in which the AGENT acquires the specific geometric form of a crystal. In this
form the place indicated by en becomes a THEME by means of a metaphorical process.
We can also think of an incorporation or conflation of the noun cristal [crystal]
into the verb, as its sense could be convertirse en cristalâ•›9 [to turn into a crystal]. This
is the same case as the former verb because we have a motion which goes from the
AGENT to the THEME, which is understood as a place in which the action is located.
According to Cifuentes Honrubia (2006), there seem to be six types of Â�
contents
in denominal verbs: causative, inchoative, instrumental, agentive, privative and local.
This verb belongs to the inchoative subtype, because inchoatives, such as Â�florecer (<flor)
[to flower] [<flower] or esclavizar (<esclavo) [to enslave] [<slave] or the Â�
metaphorical
sense in endiosar (<dios) [to deify] (<deus/god) would have the sense of starting or
initiating the conversion process in the semantic content of the noun from which
they come. Thus, cristalizar en alludes to the beginning of the process which turns
Â�
something into crystal.10
Cuajar en: [to curdle, to set] ‘hacer cuajo en’. Adlative/ubi directional sense.
The meaning of the preposition also has a locative sense of location within the
Â�
limits of a container, because, similarly to the former verb cristalizar, the action of
Â�
cuajar (to set) consists of a liquid which acquires the solid form of its container.
Â�
Therefore, there is a locative double sense which is translated to the THEME in
Â�
metaphorical uses of the verb.
At the same time, we can also observe a conflation process, such as ‘hacer cuajo en’
[to make rennet in], as the verb cuajar comes from the noun cuajo.11 This verb belongs

assume inchoatives meanings (‘convertirse en/llegar a ser’) [to turn into/to become]. In the
same way, the author concludes with a classification in which a group of denominal verbs is
formed by a series of causative types in which there is also an inchoative content.They are also
called causative-inchoative denominal verbs. The analytical form of these verbs is ‘to make,
to turn into X’ and they are verbs which can be included in transitive active patterns and
Â�
intransitive evolving patterns, such as alcoholar [to turn into alcohol], argamasar [to mortar],
barbechar [to leave fallow], amalgamar [to amalgamate]

to the same category as the verb cristalizar, since there is a causative sense Â�promoted by
the form of the container, which acts as a cause that makes the liquid solidify Â�(Cifuentes
& Lavale 2009). The adlative/ubi sense is explained in the same manner as in previous
verbs, since they include the preposition en in the analytical form.
Entroncar con: [to be related to] ‘hacer tronco con’. Adlative comitative sense.
As we can see, the verbal meaning is formed originally by metaphors upon
Â�
metaphors, since the sense of entroncar [to be related to] comes from tronco12 [trunk]
which in turn derives from the Latin noun truncus ‘mutilado, sin miembros’ [mutilated,
withoutmembers].Therefore,thereisaninitialmoreconcretemetaphorwhichbecomes
progressively more abstract as we extend its meaning towards entroncar: truncus is the
trunk of a tree because it is something like a mutilated tree, whose branches have been
cut off. The tree is the metaphor of family ties, its trunk and branches representing the
relation between its members. Finally we come to the last grade of abstraction, using
entroncar as a metaphor to link objects by means of hierarchical relationships in the
same way as in family ties, represented by the family tree.
The obligatory preposition (which does not match the prefix en) is explained by
the family ties, as the verbal action has a COMITATIVE sense, which is represented by
the preposition con [with]. The locative/adlative sense, which the prefix en adds to the
noun tronco, can be understood as a fictive motion from the AGENT to the common
place in which the action took place, represented by the COMITATIVE (con). Thus,
the directionality is adlative and the GOAL is a LOCATIVE.
We can also consider a possible conflation of the noun tronco in the Â�
analytical
form ‘hacer tronco con’ (literally ‘to make trunk with’), which would explain the
Â�
comitative sense of the preposition.
Estribar en: [to rest on, to stem from] ‘poner en el estribo algo’. Adlative/ubi
Â�directional sense.
It is evident that the locative sense of the preposition en comes from the Â�etymology
of the verb ‘apoyar el pie en el estribo’ [to rest the foot on the stirrup],13 where the

	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœµïœ·
metaphorical process takes place, which Maria Moliner adduces in the meanings of
‘consistir, radicar, residir’ [to consist, to lie in, to reside in]. This process turns the
specific place (estribo, stirrup) into a THEME, as it is considered an abstract place.
So again, we have an adlative/ubi directionality. This theme could be understood as a
subspecification of the place where we put something.
The preposition en is also obliged by the conflation of the noun estribo within the
verb, so the preposition is necessary: ‘poner en el estribo algo’ [to put something in
the stirrup].
Fallar en: [to make a mistake in] ‘poner en la falla’. Adlative/ubi directional sense.
The preposition marks the place in which the mistake is located. This mistake is a
THEME, since it is considered as an abstract place, as we have studied before.
There could be a conflation in which the noun falla would be the core of the
Â�
construction, as stated by Corominas14 and Ernout-Meillet:15 poner en la falla
[to put on the fault]. Therefore, there is a double local conception, since we have

Â�
adlative directionality in the THEME as a GOAL and, on the other hand, there is a
Â�
LOCATIVE case (ubi), since the THEME is a place. And to prove this, we can point
out that this conflation of the noun falla in the verb fallere occurs in vulgar Latin or
late Latin.
Gozar de: [to enjoy] ‘hacer gozo de algo’. Ablative directional sense.
Not only the availability, but also the use of objects which produce pleasure,
are indicated as places of SOURCE or CAUSE, and these places are conceived as
THEMES. So, in this sense the verb requires the preposition de [of] to mark this
Â�
ablative directionality. In the same way, there is a conflation of the noun gozo
Â�
[pleasure] in the analytical form hacer gozo de algo [to take pleasure in something],
as Corominas proposes.16
Hablar de: [to talk about] ‘hacer fábula de’. Ablative directional sense.
It is obvious that the verb shows a construction in which the verbal action needs
a THEME, which is again conceived as a place from which someone speaks. And the
preposition must be de [of]. The etymology reveals that the verb governs the Â�
ablative
in Latin. Examples such as fabula de duobus fratibus and fabulari a fabulis, which
belong to late Latin, show us that the ablative was used with this noun to indicate a
late conflation like in the Spanish analytical form: hacer fabula de [to make fable of].
The ablative sense seems to be interpreted also by Maria Moliner stating that the
meaning of the verb is ‘emitir sonidos que forman palabras’ [to emit sounds which
form words], in which the sense of SOURCE is implied.
Necesitar de: [need] ‘tener necesidad de’. Ablative directional sense.
The type of argument required by this verb is a THEME/PATIENT which has a
rather more local concrete sense than an abstract notional sense. According to this, the
preposition is de, because the THEME/PATIENT is an abstract place.
We find the analytical form tener necesidad de [to have the need to] conflated in
the verb necesitar [to need] in the XVIIth century,17 since this verb did not exist in
Latin (the construction was attributive: necesse esse).
Radicar en: [to lie in] ‘hacer la raíz’. Adlative/ubi directional sense.

	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœµïœ¹
This is another case in which the locative sense of the verb chooses the preposition
en, because the noun raíz18 [root] needs a place to grow. Again, the object argument
for this verb is a THEME, as an abstract place in which the action takes place.
The analytical form would be hacer la raíz [to make the root], which brings the
locative sense to the conflation in the verb.
Rayar en: [to border on] ‘hacer límite en’. Adlative/ubi directional sense.
This verb reveals the complexity of the process of grammaticalization by means
of metaphorical abstraction, since the original locative sense of the verb, ‘tirar rayas,
rayar’ [to draw lines on]19 is marked by the preposition en to indicate the place in
which the raya [line]is drawn. This raya serves as a limit to mark the change from
one cognitive domain to another. So the limit is the place that metaphorically is the
THEME to which the verb tends to approach. In this way, the adlative/ubi sense
is clear.
Thus, the sense of raya as a marked limit could be the clue for the analytical form,
‘hacer límite en’ [to make limit on], where we again find the localization of the verbal
action.
Redundar en: [to result in] ‘volver a hacer ondas en’ [to make waves again]
Adlative/ubi directional sense.
The metaphorical association between the etymological local sense and the
abstract sense of this verb is also very complex.20 The concentric movement which the
waves make on a liquid surface could be the real term of the metaphor for the verbal
action which occurs between AGENT and THEME/PATIENT. The agent transmits
the action to the place of the THEME/PATIENT in an undulating manner.
The sense of ‘rebosar’ or ‘desbordarse’ [to overflow] is also a local sense, even
in the abstract meaning, since the THEME/PATIENT is marked as a place by the
Â�preposition en.

â•… DERIV. Redundar [APal. 516b], de redŭndare ‘desbordarse’ ‘abundar sumamente’, ‘caer de

ïœ¶ïœ°	 José Antonio Candalija Reina
We can also think of a conflation such as volver a hacer ondas en [to make
waves again]. In any case, the adlative/locative sense is the same as in the previous
verb rayar.
Soñar con: [to dream about] ‘hacer sueño’. Adlative/ubi and comitative sense.
This verb has a completely abstract sense because the AGENT performs the action
of imagining that a locative situation is real (the agent dreams that it is real). And in
this imagined place, the AGENT meets the THEME. In this case the Â�
preposition has
a comitative sense, because there are two elements that coincide in the same place.
This comitative sense of the preposition is the cause of the adlative-locative sense,
because the AGENT and the THEME go to the same point to meet as a result of the
AGENT’s wish.
We can also consider conflation from the analytical form of the noun sueño21
[dream] in ‘hacer sueño’ [to make a dream].
Tachar de: [to brand someone as] ‘hacer tacha de’. Ablative directional sense.
We believe that this verb has the ablative sense of SOURCE, perhaps by analogy
with the sense of acusar [to accuse], as the CAUSE of the accusation is implicit. So we
can include this verb in causative denominal verbs (Lavale 2007). And once again, it is
possible to seek conflation from the analytical form which uses the noun tacha in hacer
tacha de22 [to make stain of]. The abstract sense consists in the association between the
physical stain and the source of a mistake which someone makes.
7.â•… Conclusions
As we have shown, in the majority of these verbs it is possible to see that the Â�presence
of the preposition has something to do with the nominal base structure of these
Â�
constructions. In this structure the verb requires the complementation of the
Â�
nominal phrase by means of a specific preposition. When the noun turns into the
core of the verb, the original preposition remains with the verb, as a preposition or
as a prefix.
This phenomenon proves that these verbs require the preposition for Â�etymological
reasons and so diachronic features must be taken into account at least as much as

	 Conflation processes in the formation of Spanish verbs	 ïœ¶ïœ±
Â�
synchronic features in order to study lexicogenetic processes, which all stages have in
common. It is important to consider that the conceptual conflation of nouns in verbs,
even those that require a preposition, is a useful tool in word formation.
We have also proved that the analytical construction is not a complete Â�
synonym
of the synthetic construction, but it provides an explanation for the obligatory
Â�
preposition, because it is in fact the meaning of that construction which requires the
meaning of the preposition and makes the preposition necessary.
Most of the examples analyzed have an abstract sense that is produced by a
Â�grammaticalization process by means of metaphors, transferring the concrete nominal
senses into the abstract verbal senses in which they conflate.
Thus, the conflation of denominal verbs must be understood as another Â�process of
the grammaticalization ways that languages have, even in their etymological origins.
Furthermore, we have confirmed that the abstract sense of the prepositions in
these verbs is motivated by the local sense from which the prepositional senses derive.
We finally state that the prepositions in these constructions have a local base
pattern which has two directions: an ablative sense of source or an adlative sense of
goal, and this supports the localist hypothesis to which we have referred to in order to
explain these denominal verbs in Spanish.

Spanish deadjectival verbs
and argument structure*
José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
University of Alicante
This chapter studies the argument structure and the semantic conflation
processes which are implicated in the formation of deadjectival verbs. After
revising the different kinds of semantic incorporation shown by Spanish
deadjectival verbs, it follows that all of them reflect the same type of conflation;
i.e. attributive conflation. In spite of their diversity – specifically those cases which
show blurred limits between patterns, and those in which it is possible to isolate
different patterns depending on the meaning and context –, it can be said that
all of them attribute a property, quality or state to a base. In fact, the difference
between them lies in the peculiarities of the base in question and,
thus, in the way in which the process is developed.
Keywords:â•‡ deadjectival verbs; argument structure; attributive relationship;
conflation
1.â•… Introduction
A verb is considered deadjectival because it has been formed on an adjectival base,
i.e. it is an adjective that leads to verbal formation. The processes that give rise to
such formations are derivation and parasynthesis. I will not go in to the problems
posed by the acceptance of these processes,1 I will simply assume them. In Â�
derivation,
Â�
verbalization takes place by applying a verbal suffix, either immediate or mediate, i.e.
either joining the verbal ending directly to the base (recto [right] > rectar [to Â�
correct]),
or Â�incorporating certain affixes at the same time (hostil [hostile] > hostilizar [to harry]).
In parasynthesis, the joint implementation of a prefix and a suffix takes place (dulce
[sweet] > endulzar [to sweeten]).
*â•‡ This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science through grant
HUM2006–09429.
ïœ±.â•… For example, in Almela (1999:â•›
24ff) it is possible to view a discussion on the various
Â�
proposals for procedures of word formation.
ïœ¶ïœ¶	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
It is a common principle that all lexicogenetic formations imply form and
Â�content.2 But while the formal relationships between components of complex
words have been repeatedly studied, the semantic relationships occurring between
them, motivated Â�
synchronously (Piera & Varela 1999:â•›4372–4373), have been Â�
little
addressed. Quoting Marchand, Reinheimer-Rîpeanu (1974:â•›50) stated that it is the
relationship between the verb and its nominal base which should constitute the
analysis from the point of view of content. Therefore, and within the set of Â�
semantic
aspects that it is possible to deal with, and adapting the words of Santiago and Â�Bustos
(1999:â•›4511), it is important to note the semantic properties which are associated with
verbalization and that can be interpreted in argument or logical-Â�
semantic terms. By
no means do I intend to limit what might be word formation to this type of analysis
at the conceptual level, since, as Santiago and Bustos (1999:â•›4512) Â�
adequately say,
this kind of semantic correspondence is not enough to account for the complexity of
lexical extension processes. In any case, the importance of semantic relations in the
analysis of the structure of complex words has been Â�
highlighted, stressing the the-
matic or argument relations which it is also Â�possible to discover inside them. Thus, it
is recognized (Piera & Varela 1999:â•›4386) that if a word head is a predicate – as in the
case of verbal formations we are focusing on –, in parallel with semantic relations
developed by syntactic units, it is able to take arguments, i.e. semantically selected
or required complements.
Something that has been highly and rightly criticized (Serrano-Dolader
1995:â•›107ff; 1999:â•›4710ff, for example), is attempting to take advantage of the obvious
Â�
relationship between analytical formations (the paraphrase) and synthetic formations
(e.g. engrasar/poner grasa en [to grease/put grease on], embarcar/poner en el barco [to
embark/put on the ship], afear/hacer feo a Y [to make Y ugly], escabrosear/hacerse
escabroso [to roughen/make rough]) as an explanatory mechanism, in the sense of
claiming that the analytical construction is the base from which to create the verb.
What has also been heavily criticized from the generative paradigm is the alleged
claim of Hale and Keyser seeking to compare the derived or synthetic formation with
the analytical formation, coming to relate this possibility with the proposals of gen-
erative semantics (Pullum 1996; Jackendoff 1997:â•›231ff; Fodor & Lapore 1998 1999).3
But Hale and Keyser (1999:â•›460) explicitly noted that the verbs are not derived from
analytical paraphrases,4 but that they merely intend to know the argument structure of
the verbs. It is, obviously, different if analytical form and synthetic form share certain
properties, derived from their related argument structure.
ïœ².â•… See Pena (1999:â•›4359), for example.
ïœ³.â•… For a response to the criticism see Mateu (2002:â•›63–75).
ïœ´.â•… It is something that was already denied by Clark, Clark (1979:â•›769).
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¶ïœ·
In any case (a) I do not intend to match the meaning of the synthetic Â�construction
with the analytical construction, (b) I do not wish to return to the old analysis of
Â�
generative semantic lexical decomposition, among other reasons, and apart from
those given at the time to criticize it, because comparing the classical example of to
kill, as cause to die, with an example like abaratar [to cheapen], is absurd: abaratar has
an obvious linguistic relation with barato [cheap], and therefore derives from it, while
matar [to kill] does not derive historically from morir [to die].
Thus, if we establish that the argument structure of abaratar is paraphraseable as
hacer barato a Y [to make Y cheap], we are not repeating the analysis and errors of com-
paring to kill with to cause to die, because we don’t want to point out their Â�
identification
of meaning, but that there is a change of state, in the sense that we Â�
attribute – or inten-
sify – a new property, quality or state to the attribution base, Â�
conveyed as a direct object.
2.â•… 
Conflation and argument structure
Incorporation is a mechanism through which an element, that serves a specific
Â�
function as regards a verb, becomes a modifier of that verb, obtaining a new complex
verb with one argument less than the original verb, i.e. it is the integration of nouns
into the sign body, within the formation of the verb. Therefore, we could understand it
as a procedure for the formation of words, as set out by Baker (1988:â•›78). Conflation is
therefore used to describe constructions where a verb and one of its arguments form
a single unit. However, conflation and incorporation affect not only nominal content,
but a diverse combinatorial option (as suggested by the analysis of Vera Luján 1987),
an aspect that we already mentioned in Cifuentes 1999, 2004, 2005 and 2006.
In a broad sense, two types of incorporation have been established: Â�
morphological
incorporation, in which the element becomes a verbal morpheme, and is fully
Â�
integrated both phonetic and morphologically; and syntactic incorporation, where
the noun becomes a phrasal unit with the verb, but it still retains its morphological
Â�
autonomy, although it loses the typical syntactic characteristics of its former function,
using as a common example of languages with this kind of incorporation cases such as
the English or the Spanish hacer mención [to make mention].
In the generative model, incorporation is understood in a narrower sense. In the
technical sense of Baker, incorporation is defined in terms of syntactic derivation,
because it affects the adjoining of lexical category X0 to another lexical category Y0, an
operation of movement that in nominal incorporation is triggered by the Â�impossibility
of X0 to receive case in position is generated.5 In other words, incorporation is defined
ïœµ.â•… More recently, Baker (1996) restricts the application of the term even more, claiming that
the root of the noun incorporated is morphologically fully integrated within the verb.
ïœ¶ïœ¸	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
as a process which motivates a semantically independent word to become an Â�
element
integrated within another linguistic unit, resulting from the application of the rule
move α (Baker 1988:â•›
51), whereby the element moves from its thematic position
towards the verbal lexical item. Furthermore, according to the Projection Principle,
such a shift may not alter or destroy the thematic structure of the utterance, so the
Â�element always leaves a permanent trace that leads an object which receives a thematic
role from the verb and meets the needs of the verbal subcategorization.
Thus, it is possible to describe incorporation in syntactic terms, saying that an
object is moving into a word that contains the verb of the sentence, but can also be
conceived in terms of derivative lexical morphology, whereby we get a new verb with
one of the arguments included as a morpheme from a verbal predicative schema.
Baker (1996:â•›280) recalls the discussion on understanding incorporation as a primarily
syntactic phenomenon or a primarily morphological phenomenon.6 In the lexical
proposal, incorporating configurations are lexical compounds, and thus, syntactic
atoms; incorporated nouns are not syntactically visible and, therefore, this proposal
cannot deliver semantically transparent syntactic representations. In the syntactic
proposal, incorporation is the result of a syntactic transformation, namely, head
movement; the main claim in this theory is that incorporated nouns are syntactically
visible because in the deep structure they are the nominal head of a NP.
In any case, the typological perspective of languages seems to discourage the
Â�
possibility of understanding denominal or deadjectival formations as a type of
Â�
incorporation. Thus, in Mithun (2000:â•›917), nominal incorporation is used as a basic
mechanism of word formation, since it provides a means of creating new lexemes for
unitary concepts (something similar to what Baker also said), but does not accept the
possibility of understanding denominal or deadjectival verbs as a kind of nominal
incorporation stricto sensu.7
Very interesting is the proposal of Hale and Keyser (2002), for whom Â�
conflation,
in Talmy’s view (2000), is a specific type of incorporation (2002:â•›11), a type that meets a
particularly strict version of the Head Movement Constraint, whereby the Â�phonological
matrix of the head of a complement is inserted into the head that governs it, Â�
producing
a single word. However, both conflation and incorporation share the property of
ïœ¶.â•… See Van Geenhoven (1998:â•›
97ff) for a confrontation between these perspectives. Later,
Baker-Aranovich and Golluscio (2005) rearrange the clash of perspectives on Â�
incorporation
into three sections:â•›
the typological functionalist perspective, which may have Mithun as
its main leader; the generative syntactic perspective, with Baker as its main representative;
and the generative lexical perspective, of which Rosen could be a participant. Similarly,
Van Â�
Geenhoven (1998:â•›108ff) aims to establish her proposal as an intermediate between the
Â�
morphological or lexical perspective and the syntactic perspective.

Â�
adapting to the Head Movement Constraint and to the Empty Category Principle, as
well as the property of forming a word by attaching the head of a complement to the
head of its syntactic governor (2002:â•›50).
However, Hale and Keyser prefer to use the name conflation to refer to the semantic
process involved in the formation of denominal and deadjectival verbs, and not only
to differ from the use Baker makes of the “incorporation” concept (even accepting that
they are closely related notions, and perhaps the same), but because they think that there
could be a difference between the two concepts, which (if accepted) would reside in the
government, a relation which plays a role in constraining both processes. In Â�
conflation,
the elements involved in the syntactic relations meet the so-called strict Â�complementation
(2002:â•›59), i.e. both are in the maximal categorical projection of X, or in other words,
specifiers do not conflate, because the categorical projection of a specifier never stands
at the same level as a potential target, governed by V. Incorporation, on the other hand,
is not restricted to this requirement: a verb cannot conflate with the Â�
specifier of its
Â�
complement, although it can incorporate it. The explanation in the generative model is
that conflation is not a process, i.e. not a movement operation. Instead, the Â�
phenomenon
which is called by that name is merely the binding relation held between the Â�
semantic
features of a verb and the features of the nominal head of its complement. This in turn
is a result of the selective relation between the verb and its complement. Selection
occurs between the verb and the head of its complement, but selection is not a relation
held between the verb and a specifier that may be present in the complement of the verb.
By contrast, incorporation is constrained by government, a relation which subsumes
Â�selection but is not confined to it: because a head governs the specifier of its complement,
there is nothing to stop it, so it is incorporated from that position (2002:â•›103).
Baker (2003:â•›167–169) is also concerned with the difference between conflation
and incorporation, and considers, in line with Hale and Keyser, that they are obviously
closely related phenomena, but in incorporation – when a noun is incorporated with
a verb – both categories retain their syntactically distinctive identities. By contrast,
in conflation there is no syntactic independence of elements, but only a recategori-
zation (which would explain the consequences identified above by Hale & Keyser).
And indeed this is what happens with denominal and deadjectival verbs: the lack
of independence of the conflated elements can be proven, inter alia, by the repeti-
tive argument which we have been using to point out that analytical and synthetic
Â�
constructions do not mean the same.
Thus, it is clear that conflation and incorporation are closely related phenomena,
but can differ, since incorporation seems drawn from perspectives that exclusively
value morphosyntactic consequences of the process, with a continued differentiation
of the elements affected by incorporation. In conflation lexical and conceptual factors
take precedence, since its morphosyntactic consequences are the loss of independence
of conflated elements, because there is a recategorization. In deadjectival verbs, the
ïœ·ïœ°	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
Â�
recategorization is a step from adjective to verb and, consequently, implies a change in
the meaning of the synthetic structure as regards the analytical construction; a change
that, as already discussed, may result in independent meanings of conflated elements
not being transparent in the new verb, as well as their relationship. In conclusion, and in
spite of the fact that in many occasions conflation and incorporation can be identified, it
is possible to differentiate them, provided we adopt a morphosyntactic perspective, not
a conceptual or semantic perspective, which is what we will generally do in this paper.
3.â•… Deadjectival verbs
Lidia Sala (1996:â•›105) says that paraphrases attributed to derived words are intended
to reflect the compositionality of the predictable meaning and the morphological
Â�
structure, i.e. the semantic contribution of the incorporated element will allow us
to determine the verb’s argument structure. In this sense, and as we have pointed
out above, without identifying the meaning of the paraphrase and the meaning of
the derived verb, different studies on Spanish deadjectival verbs have established,
Â�
generically, four types of essential meanings, which can therefore lead to four types
of distinct argument structures. We assume these structures, but we consider them
within one single overall frame where all are linked: attribution.
Most papers on the meaning of Spanish deadjectival verbs have focused on an
analysis according to suffix type; however, we are going to overlook this differentiation,
because we are not able to properly correlate a meaning for a particular form (which
does not mean that we follow the so-called ‘disengagement hypothesis’).8
Pena indicated in 1980 that Spanish breaks the Latin distinction of Â�
differentiating
state verbs and inchoative verbs: in Latin there are two semantically well defined Â�verbal
categories: -ēre verbs and -scere verbs, and although both indicate state or property, the
second category adds the inchoativity feature, so that acēre means ‘to be sour’ and
acēscere ‘to become sour’. We can see this more clearly in the following correlation
given in the RAE (2009:â•›615):
		
Clarus > clarēre (‘estar claro’[to be clear]) > clarēscere (‘ponerse claro
[to become clear, clearen]’).
		
Dulcis > dulcēre (‘ser dulce’[to be sweet]) > dulcēscere (‘ponerse dulce
[to become sweet, sweeten]’).
ïœ¸.â•… The issue of form-meaning correspondence in word formation has led in recent years
to the ‘disengagement hypothesis’, mainly promoted by Beard (1995), and also by Corbin
(1987) and Szymanek (1988), who suggested that, since the form-meaning correspondence in
Â�
morphology is hardly given one by one, semantic effects of word formation should be strictly
separated from formal effects.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ·ïœ±
		
Niger > nigrēre (‘ser negro’[to be black]) > nigrēscere (‘ponerse negro
[to become black, blacken]’).
		
Rubeus > rubēre (‘ser rojo’[to be red]) > rubēscere (‘ponerse rojo
[to become red, redden]’).
Thus, numerous Latin verbs in -scere have correlates in -ēre, but also in -īre. Â�However,
while Spanish did not inherit -ēre verbs, it did inherit many of the verbs in -īre (establir
[to establish], garantir [to guarantee], finir [to finish]), and also derived new verbs
ending in -ir following these same patterns, although most of the verbs in -ir were lost
or were replaced by verbs ending in -ecer. However, Latin could express this meaning
of state using other verbal endings, e.g. uerāre (‘to be true’).
The issue we will pose, therefore, is if Spanish, somehow, expressed and
still expresses the state meaning which was common in Latin, and that might be
Â�
paraphrased as ‘ser/estar Adj. [to be Adj.]’.
From Pena’s analysis (1993) it is concluded that in Spanish there exists the Â�possibility
of attributive argument structures with deadjectival verbs, since he points out some cases
of intransitive verbs ending in -ear with a single argument, which either incorporate the
base as a modal modifier of the derived verb or as an adscriptive Â�
predicate: bufonear
(‘actuar como un bufón [to act as a buffoon]/Y es un bufón [Y is a buffoon]’). The Â�
double
reading set for the previous example is resolved in examples of verbs derived from color
adjectives ending in -ear, which are able to express a state: negrear [to blacken]: ‘to appear
or show black colour’ = estar negro[to be black] (1993:â•›243).
From the analysis by Serrano (1999) we can also infer that it is possible to
Â�
recognize verbs indicating property, status, or situation (like escasear [to be short
of]), but notes (referring to verbs in -ear) that they are very few, since he considers
that Spanish rarely verbalizes such static concepts. He also mentions verbs derived
from color adjectives to point out that they express very similar values to statives
(‘to be X color’, ‘having or displaying X color’): purpurear [to be purplish], ama-
rillear [to be yellowish], Â�blanquear [to whiten], etc. but these verbs can also indicate
aspectual values qualified as ingressive (to acquire a shade of X, to turn X colour).
However, Rainer (1993:â•›Â�
460–461) argues that it is highly questionable that such
verbs express a truly stative predication (‘to be X’), because mi coche es amarillo
[my car is yellow] does not mean the same thing as mi coche amarillea [my car is
Â�
yellowing]. Rainer is right, although, examples such as su cara amarilleaba a la
hora de comer [his face looked yellowish at lunchtime] could accept both the stative
value and the ingressive value.
The NGLE (2009:â•›603) establishes that, although scarce, there are some verbs that
support the paraphrase ‘ser X [to be X]’, and highlights examples like transparentarse
[to show through] (‘to be transparent’) and mezquinar [to be mean] (‘to be petty with
something’).
ïœ·ïœ²	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
Grossmann (2004:â•›465) has accepted that it is possible in Italian to form stative
or continuative deadjectival verbs from the viewpoint of the action, and his approach
could be extended to Spanish, which together with the possibility of Latin verbs with
stative schemas, facilitates the acceptance of this type of construction in Spanish:
Y cojea [Y limps]: a) Y es cojo [Y is lame], b) Y is lame as regards activity: está cojeando
[he is limping].
The conclusion, therefore, that we can reach is that the type of argument structure
ser/estar X [to be X], although not very common, is possible in Spanish, and other
examples moving in a region of meaning that acts as a boundary between state and
ingressive values are also common.
ThemeaningofcomportarsecomoX[tobehavelikeX],althoughitisÂ�acknowledged
and accepted, has also been the cause of some discussion in Spanish Linguistics. Thus,
for example, Pena (1993:â•›237) or Rifón (1997:â•›47) claim that in verbs ending in -ear
with this type of argument structure, the adjectival base of the formation is normally
recategorized in a noun designating people characterized by their typical behavior,
their standard way of proceeding, and almost always includes negative or pejorative
values, such as gandulear [to be idle] or vagabundear [to wander]. A claim probably
influenced by the idea of Bosque (1990:â•›106–107) is that the change from the adjectival
category to a noun in people adjectives is “extremely fluid”, going from designating
properties, characteristic of adjectives, to designating a class or group, characteristic
of nouns. According to Pena (1980:â•›81), in these cases the adjective/noun is applied to
the subject to indicate not a note of static significance, but of dynamic significance, an
action. The adjective/noun marks the subject as the usual actor for a certain type of
event, so these verbs express a process, unlike property or state verbs, and require an
external agent as the grammatical subject, unlike the inchoative (which we will look
at now). The process consists therefore in the effective realization of a plurality of acts
expressed in their individuality by the corresponding subject. In this regard, as Pena
points out, there is a close parallel between the verb indicating the performance of
a sum of acts and the adjective/noun that characterizes the subject in that it usually
performs these acts.
Serrano (1999:â•›
4691) also realizes the undefined or categorical ambiguity
of Â�
virtually all the bases on which this kind of verbs are formed. And he rightly
shows the link between these verbs and certain clearly denominal verbs, such as
Â�
mariposear [to buzz around] or piratear [to pirate]9, explaining the Â�
similarity
between pure Â�
denominal verbs (mariposear) and deadjectival verbs with an
Â�indefinite base Â�(gandulear [to be idle]) because the verbalization of the base nouns
ïœ¹.â•… Understood as similative in theAnglo-Saxon tradition,which surely starts with Marchand
(1969:â•›320): Plag (1999:â•›125) or Lieber (2004:â•›77), for example.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ·ïœ³
(mariposa [butterfly]) emphasizes not the noun referentiality, but properties that are
deemed Â�characteristic and defining of it, which compares its interpretation to that of
Â�adjective/nouns Â�(gandul [idle]).
Verbs created from nouns designating inhabitants of a country, region, etc. are
less problematic, but they are also subject to change, because when adjectives are
Â�
verbalized they are no longer relation adjectives and must be previously re-interpreted
as Â�
qualifying adjectives, more exactly (as indicated by Pena 1993:â•›
248) as adjectives
characterizing an ordinary way of being or behaving, something already argued by
Val Álvaro (1992:â•›
617). The change from relational adjective to qualifying Â�
adjective
requires that the relationship, which, in principle, denotes belonging to a place,
becomes denotation of a characteristic property (francés [French] >afrancesar Â�[literally
to frenchen]), a stereotypical property of a cultural and encyclopedic nature, obviously
(Bosque 1990:â•›123).
It is very interesting in this regard what the R.A.E. says (2009:â•›
589): although
Â�limited to verbs ending in -ear, it sets their paraphrase as ‘actuar como X [to act like X]’
or ‘hacer de X [to play the part of X]’ (perfectly falling under the idea of comportarse
como X [to behave like X]) and recalling the frequentative aspect values identified by
all authors who have dealt with the issue, it states that this type of intransitive verbs are
interpreted attributively, both from nouns and from adjectives.
Thus, I differentiate a second type of argument structure, identified by the
Â�paraphrase comportarse como X [to behave like X], which is linked to the first structure
(ser/estar X [to be X]) by its attributive interpretation. The issues discussed relating
to possible changes from relational adjectives to qualifying adjectives, and, especially,
from adjective to noun, which seems to imply the aforementioned structure, will
not prevent us from considering it, since our starting point are verbs created from
Â�
adjectives, and if in the formation process it is understood that there is a change in the
argument structure of the elements involved, in that some adjectives become nouns,
this does not impede its consideration as an argument subtype.
The other two types of argument structures considered – inchoative and causative –
have been commonly referred to and have not posed any kind of inconvenience for their
inclusion as verbal formation schemas.
Causative verbs are transitive verbs in which the referent of the subject of the
Â�
construction is usually the intentional cause of a change of state or property of the
direct object, where the adjective is the resultative head of predication, and can also
be used, usually, in intransitive constructions with an inchoative value, either in active
form, or with a pronominal clitic. We understand by inchoative verb that in which the
referent of the construction’s subject is affected, regardless of its will, by a change of
state (Iacobini 2004:â•›174): empobrecer [to impoverish] (to make Y poor), emprobrecerse
(to become poor), abrillantar [to brigthen] (to make Y bright), ensordecer [to deafen]
(to become deaf), abribonarse [to be idle] (to become idle).
ïœ·ïœ´	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
Both causative and inchoative structures designate a change of state, i.e. a
Â�
transition of the entity affected by the event from one state to another specific state,
its semantic characteristics being intimately related to the property of the Â�
adjectival
bases (Grossmann 2004:â•›
462). As with the argument structures we have already
seen, causative and inchoative can be understood as attributive forms: deadjectival
Â�
causative constructions involve the attribution of a quality, property, or state as a
causation effect, so the affected entity changes its mode of being, and that mode of
being may be reversible or not reversible, which does not prevent the language from
considering it not reversible if there is not, for example, a new causation (Val Álvaro
1992:â•›617). Inchoative constructions produce the same type of attribution, with the
difference that causation in attributing the change of state is not outlined. Both types
of verbs indicate a change of state process, since adjectives denote properties that can
be interpreted as states.
Semantic interpretation depends not only on the reading of the adjective, but
the ability that the subject has to experience change of state without need of an
Â�
external argument that marks the change process also influences (Rifón 1997:â•›
100):
If the Â�
subject is not able in itself to experience the process, an agent element must be
assumed to cause the change undergone by that argument: los niños se escandalizaron
[the children were shocked] vs. el país se humanizó [the country became humane].
It has been common to point out the ingressive aspectual content that can be
expressed by many inchoative verbs, indicating ‘imminence or entry into a state’ (Pena
1980; 1993; Rifón 1997). For example, amarillear [to be yellowish] could mean ‘to
turn yellow’, i.e. ‘to begin to be yellow’. The aspectual analysis of deadjectival verbs is
very interesting, although I will not go into it now because it does not constitute the
aim of this paper. However, I will briefly comment, following Rifón (1997:â•›103ff), the
significant possibilities which this implies: analyzing verbs ending in -ecer, Rifón states
that if inchoativity is the expression of entry into a state, inchoative action will only
be fulfilled at the end of the entry, i.e. when the inchoative schema argument is in the
state indicated by the base noun of the verb, and, after commenting on various tests
to prove telicity, he states that these verbs, in intransitive constructions, can express
inchoativity/ingressivity and telicity, while in transitive constructions they can express
causativity and telicity.
According to Rifón (1997:â•›132–133), the imperfective state means that the Â�
subject
is in a state without showing the beginning or the end of it, the state Â�
remaining the
same for an extended period of time. Perfective state indicates that the state is given at
an exact point of a temporary process, and once past that point, that state may disap-
pear. Perfective states are always seen as a result of a process, i.e. they cannot exist by
Â�
themselves, but as a result of a change. Instead, imperfective states do not have to be the
result of a process or be subject to change. In that regard, it is very interesting to observe
the specification made by Rifón (1997:â•›134–135) concerning the Â�
paraphrase ponerse y
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ·ïœµ
hacerse [to become], very common even in the definitions of deadjectival verbs pro-
vided by the Diccionario de la Lengua Española (R.A.E. 2001). According to Rifón, as
opposed to ser and estar [to be], which are attributive stative verbs, there are a number
of dynamic verbs indicating change of state, and they do so designating the process that
changes the subject of the construction from one state to another. Some dynamic verbs
express change to a perfective state and others to an imperfective state. So, poner(se)
[to turn] or quedarse [to become] indicate change to a perfective state, which as such is
the result of a process in which the subject temporarily remains, combining with this
verb perfective adjectives and those with double perfective and imperfective expressive
ability. On the other hand, the verb hacer(se) [to become] designates imperfective state,
with different results when it joins with relative or absolute adjectives. With relative
adjectives it involves an implicit gradual change, while together with absolute adjectives
it does not express this gradation in change.10
The relationship between causative and inchoative forms has been much debated in
the generative paradigm. Burzio (1986), for example, takes the causative form as basic
and derives the inchoative form from a rule which intransitivizes verbs, and Â�
therefore
eliminates the thematic role of the external argument. Hale & Keyser (1985) start from
the inchoative form and derive the causative through a lexical process which adds a
cause abstract predicate, with its external argument, to the lexical-Â�conceptual structure
of the inchoative form, which will be subject to this abstract predicate. Pesetsky (1990)
also starts from the inchoative form and, with the adjunction of the zero morpheme
cause, derives the causative form. However, for him the process of adjoining the suffix
is not a lexical process, but it takes place within syntax; it is a Â�
process of incorpora-
tion. Borer (1991), on the other hand, considers that causative forms have a lexical
source, and inchoative forms can be derived syntactically. Gràcia (1995) assumes it is
the affix that provides the external thematic role of the causative form, and she defends
the Â�
presence of this cause affix in all forms with a causative value. In this way there is
a uniform solution for all causative verbs: causative and inchoative forms must derive
from a verbal root linked to which the cause or inchoative suffix is attached, respec-
tively. The external argument of causative forms will always be provided by the cause
suffix. Meanwhile the internal argument of causative and inchoative verbs is inherited
from the root or is created by a verbalizing process when the root is nominal.
All these aspects of derivation are very interesting, but not at all conclusive in
Spanish, because if a structure were derived from another it should be possible to
check it historically, and the history of language tells us that all constructions were
linked and there is no preponderance of one over the other, at least in a general way.

deadjectival verb and adjective type.
ïœ·ïœ¶	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
The conclusion that we reach after this quick review on deadjectival constructions
is, therefore, that it is possible in Spanish to establish four argument structures, each
one linked to different paraphrases and variations according to aspectual meanings.
Similarly, the boundaries between each of them do not exist, which will facilitate the
interpretation change from one to another.
All four argument structures are closely linked to each other, because, in a sense,
they are all variations of an attributive structure that affects either the subject or the
direct object. We do not intend to compare this to the analysis of Plag (1999:â•›125)
according to which all meanings of English verbs formed with the suffix -ize are
derived from a single semantic representation. What I would like to propose is that
all argument structures of Spanish deadjectival verbs are equivalent to attributive
constructions (including predicative constructions), and therefore Spanish dead-
jectival formation is a way of conceptualizing attribution, and, precisely, breaking
boundaries between different subtypes, as well as the functioning duality of many
verbs is proof of it.11
The four structures that we consider are the following:
a.	 X be Adj, which we paraphrase as ser/estar X.
b.	X behave as Adj., which we paraphrase as comportarse como X.
c.	X become Adj., which we paraphrase as hacerse X.
d.	X cause [Y to become Adj.], which we paraphrase as hacer X a Y.
4.â•… 
Patterns of conflation in deadjectival verbs
4.1â•… X cause [Y to become Adj.]
The hacer X a Y schema, where X is the adjectival base and Y the direct object (DO),
is the pattern of conflation most commonly used in Spanish to create deadjectival
verbs. Around 60% of the verbs used have this structure. All verbs are obviously
transitive. Ablandar [to soften] or abrillantar [to brighten] could be two of many
examples of this type, which mean, according to the definition of the DRAE: “poner
blando algo [to make something soft]” e “iluminar y dar brillantez [to illuminate and
give Â�
brightness]”. From the above meanings, it is very easy to establish the argument
structure of verbs created through conflation, because all of them have a subject
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… The thesis of Gumiel - Nieto & Pérez (1999) holds that deadjectival verbs share some
crucial properties with resultative secondary predicates. From the moment that we intend to
defend a unitary attributive meaning for all attributive argument structures of deadjectival
constructions, we somehow establish a close link with the previous paper.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ·ïœ·
that causes a state change in the DO, and that state change is a result of a Â�
causative
Â�process Â�paraphraseable as ‘make the DO ‘adjectival base’; they are, Â�therefore, Â�transitive
constructions.
In spite of having mentioned a causative schema, the conceptual semantic
schema is really attributive, linguistically similar to a DO predicative construction.
If the Â�
predicative function consists of the attribution of a property, quality or state
to a given base (in this case, a DO), there is no doubt that marked verbal forma-
tions update this schema in that they attribute the DO the property of the adjectival
base of the Â�
formation, and do so through a causative process paphraseable as hacer
[to make]:
	(1)	
Ablandar [to soften]=hacer blando Y [to make Y soft].
	(2)	
Abrillantar [to brighten]=hacer brillante Y [to make Y bright].
There are many verbs expressing a quantification of the attributive pattern, understood
as hacer más X a Y [to make Y more X]. This especially happens in adjectives that
indicate dimension or size. In these cases we understand that there is no other than the
specified schema, but we must just consider the aspects of quantification which it has,
such as aligerar [to lighten] or alargar [to lengthen],12 due to the idiosyncrasies of the
adjectival base of the formation,.
Obviously, due to the circumstances of the history of language, there are cases of
deadjectival verbs which have “dropped” the adjectival base of the formation, Â�
usually
because the verb is a Latin formation and is not transparent today. For example,
Â�
letificar [to liven up] or mitigar [to mitigate], are deadjectival verbs and, proceeding
from Latin, are not transparent in current Spanish and, even using the same pattern of
ïœ±ïœ².â•… Grossmann (2004:â•›462–463) indicates that, in general, if it is a gradable adjective, which
has an antonymous relation with another adjective, the meaning of the verb is paraphrase-
able as hacer más X a Y [to make Y more X], versus non-gradable adjectives, which have
no Â�
relationship of complementarity with another adjective. In the first case, they are verbs
Â�
involving a change between two relative states; in the second, hacer X a Y [to make Y X], there
is a transition between two absolute states. In verbs derived from antonymous Â�
adjectives, the
patient of change goes from a smaller degree of property to a greater degree, and is, Â�
therefore,
a continuum between two poles (abaratar [to make cheaper]). On the contrary, in verbs
derived from non-gradable complementary adjectives, the patient of change goes from not
having the property in question to having it (impermeabilizar [waterproof]). Derived verbs
from gradable complementary adjectives can support two interpretations depending on the
context, unlike the antonyms where there is not an interval between them: one of the two
represents the zero point of a scale, i.e. the absence of the property indicated by the other
meaning: concretar [to specify].

I agree with Serrano-Dolader (1999:â•›4685–4686) when he says that the grammatical
synchronic nature can qualify derived verbs from bases prior to all those that may be
today interpreted as such, although it could clash with a strict historical interpreta-
tion. This perspective enables him, for example, to reinterpret as derived verbs those
that have gone directly from Latin to Spanish when there is a corresponding base in
Â�
Spanish. Rainer says (1993:â•›17) that a synchronic study of word formation can cover
formal and semantic similarity relationships between the terms of a language at a
given point in time, regardless of whether or not such similarity relations are the result
of a genetic kinship. I.e. in this synchronic perspective, the target is not to know how
new formations have been formed by evolving from their respective bases, but how
they are integrated into associative structures, inter-related both formal and signifi-
cantly. As concluded by the NGLE (2009:â•›582), the most important objective, from the
ïœ±ïœ³.â•… The word ledo exists, defined in the DRAE as “1. adj. Cheerful, happy, placid.” For the
Latin adjective mitis, -e there is no equivalent in Spanish,and the Italian adjective mite,similar

	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ·ïœ¹
Â�
synchronic point of view, is to obtain a relation of interpretative transparency between
the base and the derived word.
Similarly, we should point out that, on many occasions, the adjective is not consid-
ered in its basic meaning, but it must be understood as metaphorical or metonymic. For
example, verbs like acholar, denigrar or pandar proceed from the schema hacer cholo a
Y [to make Y cholo], hacer negro a Y [to make Y black], y hacer pando a Y [to make Y
bent], but these adjectives are not taken in their usual meaning, but must be understood
with a metaphorical/metonymical change in meaning:
Acholar: ‘Shame, embarrass, scare’, from cholo: ‘Mestizo of European and indig-
enous blood’. From the idea that ser cholo [to be cholo] causes embarrassment, it is
possible to understand the current meaning of the verb.
Denigrar: ‘1. tr. Sully, offend someone’s opinion or reputation. 2. tr. Insult (wrong,
offend)’, from Latin denigrāre, ‘to make black, to stain’. The value of negro[black] is not
physically understood, but intellectually, from the link in Spanish between black and
negative.
Pandear: ‘1. tr. To cheat in gambling, especially bending cards, from pando: from
the Latin pandus, curved. 1. adj. bent. The relationship between curvar [to curve]
orpandear [to bend] and trampear [to cheat] is obvious if we consider that one of the
ways of cheating in card games consists in bending the cards.
4.1.1â•… Variations
The attributive pattern of the DO predicative enables some interesting variations
according to the adjectival base of the formation, which configures three-argument
deadjectival verbs, and not two-argument verbs, as seen so far.
Thus, there are some examples where the conflation hacer X a Y needs a third argu-
ment (apart from the subject and DO) that typically is preceded by the Â�
prepositions a
or con. There are less than 20 three-argument deadjectival verbs with this schema, but
they are the most numerous as regards variations. They are verbs that allow reciprocal
alternations,16 since the DO can be double and can indicate, in many cases, contact,
and therefore the need for two arguments. For example, verbs such as igualar [to level]
or unir [to join] enable these constructions:
	 (3)	 El albañil igualó la viga a/con el techo.
	 (4)	 El albañil igualó la viga y el techo.
	 (5)	 Mar unió a Javier con Elisa.
	 (6)	 Mar unió a Javier y Elisa.
ïœ±ïœ¶.â•… See Cifuentes Honrubia 2010:â•›24–26, 211–213.
ïœ¸ïœ°	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
Some verbs that require three-argument schemas, whose prepositional complement
is introduced by a preposition different from con, are much less numerous, almost
anecdotal.17
	 (7)	
atenúa la nefasta acción de la toxina y puede inmunizar al organismo contra
ulteriores ataques de los mencionados bacilos 1929.
	 (8)	
et me hayais de adiestrar en el oficio vuestro todo lo que yo buenamente
Â�
podiere aprender, 1502.
	 (9)	
luego pudo hazer lo mismo en los Diezmos y assí capacitar al secular para su
conozimiento. 1695.
As we can see from the examples, inmunizar18 [to immunize] implies making the DO
immune, and seems to require the item to which it is immune, usually introduced by
the preposition contra [against]. Adiestrar19 [to train] outlines the conflation to make
skilful, and also seems to need the object that has the ability. Finally, capacitar20 [to
qualify] involves making capable, and as in previous cases, the object of this ability
is needed. In all of these cases it seems as though the verbs inherit the complement
that the adjectival base of the formation develops: ser immune a (contra) algo [to be
immune to (against) something], ser diestro en algo [to be skilful at something], ser
capaz de (para) algo [to be capable of (for) something].
4.2â•… X be Adj
In Spanish the difference between the attributive pattern ser X [to be X] and the attrib-
utive pattern estar X [to be X], seems relevant if it is assumed as reflecting one of
the most important grammatical distinctions of Spanish. However, it seems clear we
must point out two things: 1. there are many intermediate cases, and 2. the differences
must be conceptual, not grammatical, so the key differentiation must reside in the
consideration of attribution as more or less temporary or essential, and not so much
in paraphrases.
4.2.1â•… Ser X
The attributive pattern is usual in Spanish. This is a semantic conflation where, quite
simply, a property, quality or state is attributed to the subject indicated by the Â�
adjectival
base of the verbal formation. Obviously if the construction was transitive in the model
ïœ±ïœ·.â•… All of the examples incorporated in the text are obtained from the CORDE or, where

	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¸ïœ±
hacer X a Y (and as we have pointed out, the possibility of three arguments remains
open: subject, direct object and prepositional complement), and the verb conflates a
DO attributive/predicative pattern, the constructions will be intransitive in this case,
where the only required argument is the subject, from whom a property, quality or state
expressed by the adjectival base of the verbal formation is attributively predicated.
Examples like proliferar21 [to proliferate] (from prolífico [prolific]) or promiscuar22
[to mix] (from promiscuo [mixed]) express a clear ser X schema:
	 (10)	 El epitelio de la mucosa bucal prolifera y forma eminencias hacia, 1870–1901.
	 (11)	
y como para él, lo mismo eran los nacionalistas y los autonomistas,
los Â�
porteños y los provincianos, los federales y los unitarios, con todos
Â�promiscuaba, 1884.
The attributive pattern ser X has been commonly identified as a valid pattern of confla-
tion for deadjectival verbs. However, some particularities already noticed in this regard
bring forward interesting ideas. Thus, for example, the RAE (2009:â•›603) asserts that
transparentar(se) [to be transparent] “is used in the sense of ‘being transparent’”. And,
indeed, the DRAE’s second meaning also confirms that value.23 However, if we consult
the data in the CORDE, we will find that the verb has simultaneous uses of conflation
understood as ser transparente [to be transparent] and other possible conflations:
	 (12)	 Ni pintada; parecéis, en lo que se transparenta por la muselina el talle, 1763.
	 (13)	 y las mantillas que sutiles transparentan lo vario de los ropajes, 1768.
	 (14)	
en silencio tan completo, se trasparenta un objeto inmenso... la Â�
eternidad,
1837–1840.
	 (15)	
velado siempre de nubes densísimas, que a veces transparentan engañosas
ilusiones, 1850.
Firstly, the examples prove that the verb may be transitive, and although examples
with transparentarse do not properly suggest a state paraphraseable as ser (or estar),
clearly some kind of process is involved. Something similar happens with other verbs
that could present the conflation ser X, because they can adopt uses both transitive and
intransitive, such as controvertir24 [to dispute] (regressive derivation of Â�
controvertido
[controversial]), hiperbolizar25 [to hyperbolize] (from hiperbólico [hyperbolic]),
ïœ²ïœ±.â•… DRAE: 2. intr. To multiply abundantly.
ïœ²ïœ².â•… DRAE: 2. intr. To participate either in heterogeneous or opposite, physical or immaterial
things.
ïœ²ïœ³.â•… DRAE: 2. intr. Applied to a body: to be transparent.
ïœ²ïœ´.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. To discuss carefully and at length material advocating opposing views.
ïœ²ïœµ.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. To use hyperboles.

Â�
aconsonantar26 [to rhyme] (from consonante[consonant]), variar27 [to vary] (from
uariāre, formed from uarius, -a, -um, according to Ernout and Meillet (1959)),
or Â�
igualar28 [to equalize] (from igual [equal]). Although intransitive uses can be
Â�understood as ser X, transitive uses may be understood as hacer X a Y29, among other
schemas. In addition, there is no significant difference in the chronology of the two
uses, which means that we can establish not only motivation of one use over another,
but that the two uses can arise independently, although they are obviously related:
	 (16)	
sin aver ávido hasta el día de oy quien aya controvertido esto ni puéstolo en

	(25)	 orgulleçio & cogio ssoberuja & quisso sse egualar con el. 1260.
The examples given clearly demonstrate the alternation of deadjectival verbs in
Â�
constructions of attributive argument conflation and DO predicative constructions, as
noted in the previous paragraph, as well as others which we will discuss later.
It is obvious that, despite there being far fewer examples created from this type
of pattern, it is possible to find cases in which the adjectival base does not exist in
Spanish: estridular30 [to screech], derived from the Latin stridŭlus, ‘scratchy’, and
ïœ²ïœ¶.â•… DRAE: 2. tr. To use the consonant rhyme. 3. intr. Applied to a word: to be the consonant
of another.
ïœ²ïœ·.â•… DRAE: 4. intr. Applied to a thing: being different from another.

which have only allowed derived forms in Portuguese (estrídulo) and Italian (stridulo):
ser estridulo:
	(26)	 Al pie de la torre sentíase estridular una cigarra; 1929.
4.2.2â•… Estar X
There are examples in Spanish clearly showing this attributive pattern of argument
conflation that reject a possible interpretation with ser, which, as we have said, does not
mean that there is no relation between the two attributive patterns (and all Â�
attributive
patterns). Let us consider, for example, the verb enfermar31 [to fall ill], which rejects
the Spanish paraphrase ser enfermo, conceptualising more adequately as estar enfermo.
The earliest examples confirm this, transitive examples appearing much later32 (hacer
enfermo a Y [to make Y ill]):
	(27)	 ovo a enfermar muy fuert’ la mesquiniella, 1230.
	(28)	 El mucho vino faze enfermar el cuerpo, 1250.
	(29)	 y una mudanza tan grande basta a matar o enfermar un pupilo. 1550.
However, the verb is more complicated than it initially appears, since it is a Latin
Â�formation: infirmō ~āre ~āui ~ātum, and it is transitive, as opposed to the Spanish,
essentially meaning ‘to weaken’ or in the technical sense, ‘to annul’33. I.e. the Latin verb
would correspond to what we have called a DO attributive conflation: hacer ‘infirmus’
a Y [to make Y ill]. The metonymy between ‘not firm’, ‘weak’ and ‘ill’ is very clear,
but while classical Latin seems to have verbally developed a deadjectival construction
through the argument conflation hacer X a Y in early meanings, Spanish focuses on
the last link in the chain of meanings, and, despite having the Latin verb, seems to have
developed the formation from the conceptual schema estar X, i.e. estar enfermo [to be
ill], with the meaning of ‘having illness’, and could later develop another Â�
transitive
schema, similar to the Latin, hacer X a Y, but with the Spanish meaning itself, even
though the DRAE also collects the Latin inherited meaning ‘to weaken, remove
Â�firmness’.34
ïœ³ïœ±.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To cause illness. 3. intr. To contract illness.
ïœ³ïœ².â•… We consider no examples where enfermar is constructed with the verb hacer [to make],
because the DO is still the subject of enfermar and can, therefore, be conceptualized as estar
enfermo [to be ill]: pora fazer enfermar a qual omne quier de qualquier enfermedat. 1279.
ïœ³ïœ³.â•… OLD: 1 To weaken physically (people or things). b to deprive of military strength. 2
To make faint-hearted, unnerve. 3 To lessen the authority or effectiveness of. bto lessen or
destroy the force of (an argument,contention,or sim.),refute,deny,etc.4 To make void,annul,

Examples of this verbal schema are shown by cases like hermosear [to beautify],
asperear [to be rough], ronquear [to be hoarse], pintonear [to ripen], callosar [to
toughen], languidecer [to languish] or chochear [to dodder]. Some cases are difficult
to demonstrate accurately, because they are not listed examples in the CORDE/CREA,
and we can only interpret them from the DRAE’s definitions, such as pintonear35 or
callosar36 (also found in the María Moliner dictionary), and, in principle, they seem
to tend towards the conflation estar pintón [to look ripe] or estar calloso [to be tough].
Other examples, such as hermosear37 or asperear38 also confirm this, but in their
intransitive variant, because the transitive seems to form the hacer X a Y39 schema:
estar hermoso [to be beautiful], estar áspero [to be rough]:
	(30)	 Los valles hermoseavan con prados regándolos con las fuentes 1542.
	(31)	 y si hará un cierto ruydo, como de cosa áspera o que asperea. 1605.
Examples with Ronquear40 [to be hoarse] are very interesting, because they seem to
indicate that the subject says something estando ronco [being hoarse], because in
Spanish it is possible to ser de voz ronca [have a hoarse voice], but a person never es
ronca but está ronca:
	(32)	
No me siento -ronqueó Barquín haciendo contrapunto a la voz de flauta de su
hermano. 1941.
In the last mentioned examples, chochear41 [to dodden] and languidecer42 [to languish],
if we say that someone chochea, it is not that they sea chocho [are permanently senile],
but that they esté chocho [are temporarily senile]. Similarly, if someone languidece they
está lánguido [are languid]:
	(33)	 ¿Este buen viejo chochea? -me preguntó Quevedo, y prosiguió-: 1727–1728.
	(34)	
y aquella organización sensible y armoniosa languidecía de placer y de amor,
1851–1855.
As noted at the beginning, there are abundant verbs and examples where it is difficult
to define whether we are dealing with the conflation ser X or estar X . Thus, intransitive
ïœ³ïœµ.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. Referring to fruit: to acquire a ripe color.

examples of azulear43 [to turn blue] are difficult to delimit attributively as estar azul
orser azul.
	(35)	

luz 1863.
The same could be said of many other cases like bizquear44 [to squint], caducar45 [to
deteriorate], cojear46 [to limp], etc. in intransitive uses, where it is difficult to differen-
tiate ser/estar bizco [to be cross-eyed], ser/estar caduco [to be deteriorated], ser/estar
cojo [to be lame]:
	(36)	 Cuando se encolerizaba se volvía fea y parecía bizquear, 1956.
	(37)	 junta mente començo a caducar la lengua latina: 1492.
	(38)	
porque el que cayó del cielo a la tierra, como sea más flaco, y tenga necesidad
de materia parece cojear. 1580.
4.2.3â•… Variations
Some deadjectival formations created by the attributive pattern ser/estar X are very
interesting, since being transitive, they need to implement a relationship on the item
affected by the action, the DO. This relationship can normally be paraphraseable using
con [with] or de [of]. E.g. asesinar47 [to murder], asesorar48 [to advise], hostilizarâ•›
49
[to harry], idolatrar50 [to worship], galantear51 [to flirt], garantir52 [to guarantee], etc.
In all these cases the conflation is ser asesino de [to be a murderer of], ser/estar asesor
con/de [to be an advisor of], ser/estar hostil con [to be hostile to], ser idólatra con/de
[to be idolatrous of], ser/estar galante con/de [to be gallant with], ser/estar garante de
ïœ´ïœ³.â•… Despite the definition of the DRAE, transitive examples are possible: éste para herir los
semblantes de finísimos picotazos de aguja, colgar gotitas de fluxión en las fosas nasales, azulear
las mejillas y enrojecer los párpados. 1883
DRAE: 1. intr.Applied to something object: to display its blue color tinge. 2. intr. To go blue.
ïœ´ïœ´.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. To be cross-eyed or simulate it.

ïœ¸ïœ¶	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
[to be a guarantee of]. Obviously I have not included meanings derived by metonymic
or metaphorical cognitive motivation, which can also coexist with those projected by
attributive conflation, as noted in the previous section:
	(39)	 Porque demás de que son muy dificultosos de asesinar éstos,1657.
	(40)	 acaba de asesorar al tribunal en el sentido de los apetitos, 1881.
	(41)	

	 (42)	 Reloj es el que yo vi idolatrar tus auroras,1597–1645.53
	(43)	 Y también debéis notar que ha sido galantear todo aquesto, y amor no; 1610.
	(44)	
mi proposicion no se dirige solo á garantir á los dos señores preopinantes
	1822.
Verbs like confraternizar54 [to fraternize]or intermediar55 [to mediate]are a Â�
different
case, while also expressing an attribution conflation (ser fraterno [to be fraternal], ser
intermedio [to be intermediate]), and, as in the above cases, there is an item affected
by the verbal schema projected by the adjective. This affected item does not appear
as the DO, but as a prepositional complement, introduced by con [with] or entre
[between]. I.e. it would be a similar schema to the previously proposed examples,
with the Â�
difference that the previous verbs were intransitive and the relational item
is Â�
conflated within the verbal schema. In the verbs we are looking at, the relational
item is not integrated in the verbal schema, but it appears syntactically introducing an
prepositional adjunct:
	(45)	
y refugiados en un portal los cazadores, confraternizaron en seguida con los
Â�nacionales. 1868.
	(46)	
Y tiene como poderes propios “el de interpretar e intermediar entre dioses y
Â�hombres” 1940–1942.
Parallel examples to those discussed in the previous paragraph, such as confraternizar
[fraternize], can also express reciprocal alternations, not transitive, as in the above
examples, but intransitive. I.e. the complement introduced by the preposition con can
also appear inside the verbal subject:
	(47)	 Ejército y pueblo confraternizaron, y la aspiración se cumplió. 1890.
ïœµïœ³.â•… The first uses of the verb are clearly intransitive and show attributive conflation.
The Â�conflation ser idólatra con/de [be idolatrous of] is clearly later formation: razón es de
Â�
reprochar el continuo idolatrar de nuestros falsos christianos,1467–1482.
ïœµïœ´.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. To treat with friendship and camaraderie.
ïœµïœµ.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. To mediate (to exist in the midst of other things).
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¸ïœ·
The verb aparentar [to seem] is very interesting, since it is a transitive verb and does
not repeat the indicated schema where it is necessary to understand a relationship for
the item affected by the verbal action (DO): ser firme y aparentar ligereza (1773). I.e.
the DO is ‘what seems’, not what is affected by ser aparente [to be apparent]. However,
its use may have a metonymic explanation, especially if we consider that the first verbal
uses are similar to confraternizar or intermediar:
	(48)	
Bien nos conujene aparentar con Pompeyo por seyer participantes
	1379–1384.
	(49)	 Aurame de consolar el aparentar contigo, 1595–1603.
The metonymic relationship between who seems and what is seemed could cause
and explain the especially current uses of aparentar, somewhat different from the
citations.
4.3â•… Y behaves as X
The conflation comportarse como X is one of the most common verbal schemas for
deadjectival verbs. It is also an attributive schema which affects the verbal subject, as
in previous examples, but differs in that it does not exactly indicate a state (with ser or
estar or a neutralization of both), but a process, more specifically an activity performed
in a certain way according to the property expressed by the adjective.56 Val Álvaro
(1992:â•›620) claims that this is a dynamic event which, unlike inchoative structures, is
controlled by the subject. Thus, we can see in any example of agringarse57 [to act like
a foreigner] that the subject cannot ser gringo, and it is impossible to paraphrase it in
Spanish as estar gringo because it is a permanent property. I.e. the state change which
the subject undergoes does not result in the attributive property ser gringo, but it can
merely comportarse como un gringo [behave as a foreigner]. However, this type of verbs
formed from adjectives linked to a place, region, country, etc. are very controversial,
as we shall see later.
ïœµïœ¶.â•… In Spanish, the interpretative paraphrase comportarse como X is an attributive
Â�
construction, therefore when como [like] is used in the sense of ‘en calidad de [in the
Â�
capacity of]’ before a predicative, it is assimilated to prepositions. Thus, we do not mean
that the Â�
deadjectival verb means comportarse como, but they have a similar attributive
Â�interpretation.
ïœµïœ·.â•… DRAE: 1. To acquire the look or customs of a foreigner.
“Aura va pa la ciudad, se agringa del todo, y si te he visto no me acuerdo. Y si le va bien, es hasta
capaz de avergonzarse del criollo viejo que le dio el ser...” (1904).
ïœ¸ïœ¸	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
We could say something similar about other examples such as aseglararse58 [to
Â�secularize], apicararse59 [to become crafty] or bobear60 [to fool about]. In all cases, the
pattern of verbal conflation is comportarse como seglar [behave like a layman], pícaro
[to behave like a villain] or bobo [to behave like a fool]. The first example, aseglararse,
is an identical case to agringarse, and while nobody is born secular or religious
(though they can be born foreign), it is true that, in the Catholic religion, the priest
never ceases to be a priest, though he may stop professing his vows. In any case, it is
someone who es clérigo [is religious], and behaves like a seglar [layman]. I.e. he can-
not become a Â�
layman, because he is a clergyman, but behaves as such. As in the other
case commented, one cannot estar seglar [be a layman temporarily]: one is or is not,
and once one is, one cannot stop being it, even if their behavior is another. Behaviors
such as pícaro or bobo are different, since they are not permanent qualities, although
it is possible to ser pícaro [be cheeky] or ser bobo [be silly], but also to estar pícaro
[behave cheekily] or estar bobo [behave foolishly]. In any case, the processes that the
verbs seem to describe do not indicate that someone who is not es/está pícaro or bobo,
becomes ser/estar pícaro or bobo. There is no such state change, but simply someone
behaves this way during a certain period of time, but we cannot say, in principle, that
that person sea/esté boba or pícara [is silly or cheeky]. The examples in the CORDE
greatly simplifies the explanation:
	(50)	 Muy dulce es el rato de bobear para el que no es bobo. 1653.
	(51)	 Deja ya de bobear. 1852.
The Spanish language perfectly reflects the difference between hacerse bobo [to become
a fool] vs. hacerse el bobo [to act a fool]. A change of state occurs in the first case,
and this would represent an attributive schema like hacer X a Y [to make Y X], but
applied to the subject, as we will discuss below. In the second case, there is no such
state change, because he who hace el bobo [acts a fool], in principle, simply behaves
like a fool, but is not a fool.
Thus, we are looking at the attribution of a property, quality or state, not of a
Â�
simulated form (although it may be), but of a form that makes the subject which
Â�
possesses it change its state temporarily.
As was the case with all the previous examples, and as a general rule, it is possible
to find examples where the quality, property or state referred to by the adjective is not
directly understood, but in a metonymic or metaphorical way. Thus, examples such as
ïœµïœ¸.â•… DRAE: 1. prnl.Applied to a clergyman or a religious person: to relax in the requirements
of their state, performing it and living like a layman.
ïœµïœ¹.â•… DRAE: 1. prnl. To acquire villanous ways or manners.
ïœ¶ïœ°.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. To do or say silly things.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¸ïœ¹
guapear, patojear or peludear express the motivated relationship of meanings. In the
case of guapear61, the first three meanings have a direct relationship with the Â�different
meanings of the adjective62 (resembling a metaphorical extension from meaning
3 to meaning 4), which occur by metonymic motivation of the adjective’s meaning
1. Patojear63 or peludear64 are precisely cases of verbal formations from metaphorical
or metonymic motivation of the adjective meaning: Patojo means: ‘1. adj. That has
bent or disproportionate legs or feet, and resembles a duck while walking, moving
the body from one side to another’. It is clear that the hesitation in walking can be
applied to other aspects of life, such as intellectual ones, and makes verbal meaning
1 possible. Similarly, peludo [hairy] means: ‘1. adj. Who has long hair’, which can
cognitively motivate verbal meaning 1, since to have long hair is a difficulty for many
daily activities.
Another aspect that will be a general rule with all deadjetival formations is that
it is possible to find verbs where the adjectival base of the formation does not exist in
Spanish. Reblagar65, for example, from the Latin ualgus66, [knock-kneed] would be an
example, because there is no adjective in Spanish, only in the technical language of
medicine would we find the word valgo or valgus67, which does not seem appropriate
to derive the verb.
Along with the previous pattern, which constitutes intransitive constructions,
it is very interesting to observe that the conflation comportarse como X gives rise
to Â�
transitive constructions, thus including (as in the previous Section 4.2.3.) confla-
tions which should be interpreted similarly to comportarse como X con [to behave
like X with], i.e. the DO is the patient or recipient of the activity expressed by the
ïœ¶ïœ±.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. colloq. To show courage and gallantry when faced with dangers. 2. intr.

verb, and, at the same time, such verbal formations must also denote a relationship
(which we represent using a preposition) with the DO. Examples such as chulear68 [to
strut around], regalonear69 [to spoil] or fisgonear70 [to snoop] are proof of this, their
Â�
verbal conflations being similar to comportarse como un chulo/regalón/fisgón con X
[to behave like someone smart/spoiled/snooping with X]. Chulear, as well as many
other Â�
examples, allows intransitive constructions, which means that it also presents
the Â�conflation comportarse como X in these meanings, but now we are interested in
transitive constructions:
	(52)	
El viejo es tan marrullero, que me temo ha de chulearnos llegándolo á conocer.
1761.
	(53)	
calladitas alrededor de esta tonta de la Iris, regaloneándola y consintiéndola
en todo 1970.
	(54)	 Todo lo fisgoneaban, todo lo sabían y todo lo conocían, 1888.
These examples prove that the subject se comporta como un chulo con [behaves like
a show off with] us, se comporta como un regalón con [behaves like a spoiled brat
with] silly Iris, and se comporta como un fisgón con [behaves like a snooper with]
everything.
4.4â•… become X
There is a large group of verbs constructed from the conflation hacerse X [to become
X], which may be conveyed by a pronominal verb, a simple verb or a transitive verb in
a reflexive construction. We are looking at a very similar pattern to that indicated in
Section 4.1., but being intransitive/pronominal constructions, there is not a Â�
different
DO to that affected by the action developed from the adjective, but the change of state
affects the subject. As we have just pointed out, this can occur with both intransi-
tive verbs like amarillecer71 [to yellow], empalidecer72 [to go pale] or enflacar73 [to
get thin], interpretable as hacerse amarillo, pálido or flaco [to become yellow, pale or
thin], and with verbs of obligatory pronominal construction which have an impact on

subject, like amoratarse74 [to turn purple], ufanarse75 [to boast] o bestializarse76
[to turn beastly], interpretable as hacerse morado, ufano or bestial [to become purple,
proud or beastly].
	(55)	

	(60)	

bestiali-zarse 1925.
We can also find verbs that have meanings constructed from one of the conflations
already outlined above, but which enable some pronominal use in this pattern of
conflation, like engordar77 [to get fat], avasallar(se)78 [to submit] or agudizar(se)79
[to sharpen], interpretable as hacerse gordo, vasallo or agudo [to become fat, a vassal
or sharp]:
	(61)	 que la Gulf Oil seguirá engordando con el sudor de nuestros obreros 1977.
	(62)	 Trueque amor, contrate y venda si al interés se avasalla; 1626–1630.
	(63)	
parece que el sonido se agudiza hasta que el tren contrario pasa ante

Many verbs for which the dictionary does not enable two constructions, Â�
transitive
and pronominal, have two uses, like bestializarse, since although the DRAE shows
it as a pronominal verb, we find transitive uses; or malignizarse80 [to become evil],
which the DRAE treats as pronominal, but which also allows not pronominal
Â�intransitive uses:
	(64)	 Y así, lejos de encanallar y bestializar los bailes modernos 1922.
	(65)	 Cuando un lunar maligniza, suele sangrar y doler. 2002.

ïœ¹ïœ²	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
Indeed, as we can see in these recent examples, the analysis of the CORDE and
the CREA shows that one same verb can have various uses (transitive, intransi-
tive, Â�
pronominal), whether or not they are included in the DRAE, even though the
Â�
dictionary’s Â�
definition may restrict these uses. Moreover, we can find some verbs that
develop various Â�
conflations for different meanings of the adjectival base. For example,
despertar81 [to wake up], from despierto [awake], may involve the pattern of confla-
tion hacer despierto a Y [to make Y awake] in transitive uses (some considered from
a Â�
cognitive motivation), or the conflation estar despierto [to be awake], in meaning 5,
and the conflation hacerse despierto [to become smart], in meaning 6.
What I would like to conclude on this aspect is that different types of conflations
are blended in the uses of the different verbal constructions.
We found some cases, similar to examples discussed in other sections, indicating
reciprocal alternation, like solidarizar82[to support], thus indicating that the subject
can be multiple, or that there may be a prepositional adjunct in alternation:
	(66)	 fue el único que se solidarizó con ellos 1921.
	(67)	
Más tarde, cuando practicado “por indivudual”, como decía nuestro amigo
el cosechero de Los Barrancos, aquella especie de culto al sol, se solidarizan y
crean el bando. 1941–1961.
4.4.1â•… Quedarse X [to remain X] and dejar X a Y [to leave Y X]
Finally, I wanted to point out that certain verbs, intransitive and pronominal, involve
a pattern of conflation which is not exactly hacerse X [to become X], or estar X [to
be X], but which seems better interpretable as quedarse X [to remain/end up X]; i.e.
there is some kind of process, it is not merely a state, but it underlines the result. The
R.A.E. (2009:â•›2842) characterizes it as a process which leads to a transitory state, and
Demonte & Masullo (1999:â•›
2512) consider it as a semi-attributive verb that takes
as its complement a predicative element which introduces the resulting state of a
change, transitory or permanent. If someone enviuda [becomes widowed], that per-
son clearly es or está [is] widowed, but what the verb means is not the state, but the
process that led to this result: se ha quedado viudo [he ended up widowed]. Similarly,
we can interpret that if someone se emboba [becomes besotted], it is not that this
subject sea bobo [is stupid], nor that se haya hecho bobo [he has become stupid] nor
ïœ¸ïœ±.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To cut, interrupt sleep who is sleeping. 2. tr. To renew or bring to memory
something already forgotten. 3. tr. To make someone back on itself or consider. 4 tr. To move,
excite. To whet one’s apetite. 5. intr. To stop sleeping. 6. intr.Applied to a person who was rude,
silly or simple: Become more aware, advised and well-informed.
ïœ¸ïœ².â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To make someone or something jointly shared with other person or thing.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¹ïœ³
that se comporte como un bobo [he behaves stupidly], but that se ha quedado bobo [he
has ended up besotted].
There are many different verbs that allow this relationship of meaning, which, on
the other hand, it is often difficult to distinguish adequately from previous schemas.
But, I insist, it is fundamentally a matter of profiling the result of a process which leads
to a state, although, occasionally, the verb can also indicate the state. It seems, there-
fore, that it is a case of a time limit, the start of a state, and if this time limit is broken,
the verb goes on to indicate another attributive conflation. Verbs like enviudar83 [to
be widowed], contentarse84 [to be contented], enmudecer85 [to be silent], ensordecer86
[to go deaf], encanecer87 [to go grey], inmovilizarse88 [to be immobilized], purificarse89
[to purify] or embobarse90 [be besotted], at some point enable the referred meaning:
quedarse viudo, contento, mudo, sordo, cano, inmóvil, puro or bobo [to end up widowed,
contented, silent, deaf, grey, immobile, pure or besotted]:
	(68)	 quando la muger enviudare e mantoviere viudeza, 1264.
	(69)	
Por el momento debe usted contentarse con el bacalao frito de su abuela.
1908–1930.
	(70)	 Entonçes enmudecí, y la verguença abaxó los mis ojos a tierra 1425–1450.
	(71)	 gritavan de tal manera que ensordecían los trabajadores.1554.
	(72)	 Pero también yo encanecí temprano, y parezco de doblada edad. 1499–1502.
	(73)	
Después de la unión de los sexos, estas hembras se inmovilizan por completo
allí donde tienen clavado su pico,1893.
	(74)	
E después contenpla en cómo fue llena en el tienpo de los doctores sant Agostín

	(75)	
pero se emboba de suerte con la dulzura del sonido que se alegra de que le
alaben, como si la tuviera. 1653.
In any case, we must make it clear that these are subject attributive constructions,
temporal and aspectually marked, but subject attributive constructions nonetheless.
ïœ¸ïœ³.â•… DRAE: 1. intr. T be widowed.
ïœ¸ïœ´.â•… DRAE: 3. prnl. To be contented.

ïœ¹ïœ°.â•… DRAE: 2. prnl. Applied to a person: to be astonished, lost, surprised.
ïœ¹ïœ´	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
Similar to the above-mentioned constructions are schemas composed of verbs like
aplanar91 [to smooth], asegurar92 [to secure], exentar93 [to exempt], soltar94 [to drop],
vaciar95 [to empty] or yermar96 [to go to waste], where conflation also indicates the
result property, quality or state of the attribution, although in this case applied to
the DO, and is often paraphrased as dejar X a Y [to leave Y X]: dejar plano, seguro,
exento, suelto, vacío or yermo [to leave smooth, secure, exempt, free, empty or wasted].
Â�
Somehow, this pattern of conflation is the transitive correlation of the previous confla-
tion quedarse X [to end up X], and is similar to it in every aspect: If someone vacía
[empties] something, they obviously hace vacío [make it empty], i.e. there is a state
change, but particularly emphasizing the result, i.e. that lo deja vacío [is left empty]:
	(76)	 cuando ya el silencio que os aplanaba recalcó tu metedura de pata. 1984.
	(77)	 donde puedes asegurar estos tales thesoros, 1471–1476.
	(78)	
mas los otros señores inferiores pueden exentar a sus vasallos de pecharles a
ellos, 1589.
	(79)	 los alcaldes manden lo soltar a las pesquisas. 1196.
	(80)	 e estudiemos vaciar nuestros corazones de las terrenales consolaciones, 1417.
	(81)	 mata los omnes sin derecho. & yerma las poblaciones. 1250–1300.
Considering metaphorical and metonymic cognitive relationships in meaning
Â�
relations also allows us to better understand certain verbal meanings which seem to
move the verbal value to the result of the action described by the property, quality,
or state of attribution. E.g. verbs such as fecundar [to fertilize], enfriar [to cool] or
enhestar [to erect], can indicate the result of property, quality or state attribution, a
result cognitively motivated by the consequence of the action. This way, its meaning
seems more appropriate if paraphrased as quedar/dejar [to end up/to leave]+ verbal
Â�participle, something that does not precisely happen with causative verbs like ablandar
[to soften] or abrillantar [to brighten].
Fecundar:‘1.tr.Biol.TojointhemalereproductivecellandthefemaleÂ�reproductive
cell in order to create a new being. 2. tr. To make something productive. 3. tr. To directly
make something fertile or productive through generation or similar’. Meaning 1 does
not exactly indicate the action hacer fecundo a Y [to make Y fertile] but the result of
that action: quedar fecundado [to end up fertilized].
ïœ¹ïœ±.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To level (make something level).
ïœ¹ïœ².â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To make something steady and secure, to fix it solidly.
ïœ¹ïœ³.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To leave exempt.
ïœ¹ïœ´.â•… DRAE: 2. tr. To let go or give freedom to who is arrested or convicted.
ïœ¹ïœµ.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To leave something empty. To empty a bottle. To empty a pocket.
ïœ¹ïœ¶.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To let land go to waste.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¹ïœµ
Enfriar: ‘1. tr. To turn cold or make something go cold. 2. tr. To reduce affection, to
moderate the force and heat of passion. 3. tr. To limit the effectiveness of actions. 4.
prnl. Applied to a person: to go cold. 5. prnl. To catch a cold’. Meaning 1 seems more
linked to the result of the action of property attribution than to the action itself, as
proven in meaning 4.
Enhestar: ‘1. tr. To raise, to put something upright and lift it. 2. tr. Ant. To raise
people of war. Meaning 1 also seems to more suitably express the result of the action of
hacer enhiesto a Y [to make Y erect], which means to remain in that position.
Furthermore, as enfriar or enhestar have highlighted, it is clear that when consid-
ering the meaning of deadjectival verbs, we only consider the meaning provided by the
adjectival base of the formation, leaving other verbal meanings, if any, to be explained
by metaphorical and metonymical processes. For example, amargar [to make bitter]
has the following meanings according to the DRAE in current Spanish:
1.	 tr. To give an unpleasant taste or flavor.
2.	 tr. To cause distress or annoyance.
3.	 tr. Applied to a person: to experience resentment due to frustration, failure,
annoyance, etc.
4.	 intr. Applied to a person: To have bitter taste or flavor.
Meaning 1 is supported by the schema hacer amargo a Y [to make Y bitter]. Meanings
2 and 3 are derived by cognitive relations from 1, because the quality changes from
being applied physically to intellectually. Meaning 4 has a state attributive schema:Â�
ser/estar X.
When these verbs have the possibility to affect the subject, for example through
pronominalization, or to affect the DO, by becoming transitive, obviously their
Â�
meanings agree on the exchange, as in yermarse (quedarse yermo [to be wasted]) or
enmudecer (dejar mudo a Y [to leave Y speechless]):
	(82)	 que las villas se pueblan con mucho lazerío e yerman-se por mucho vicio; 1250.
	(83)	 que con su sombra enrronquesce y enmudece los perros,1540–1550.
Hacerse, volverse, ponerse and quedarse are typical paraphrases of deadjectival verbs,
included many times in dictionary definitions. When we pointed out that the inter-
pretation of deadjectival verbs is paraphraseable by one of them, we did not want to
say, of course, that they mean the same, but that they express similar content, which
we have organized around the inchoative paraphrase hacerse (to become, to turn), and
the resultative variant quedarse (to end up). It should be noted that all these verbs are
understood as semi-attributives in Spanish grammars, i.e. verbs which can also be used
as full verbs but that in certain constructions (semi-attributive uses), the attributive
expression is essential. All these verbs indicate change of state, but are differentiated by
ïœ¹ïœ¶	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
the aspectual contents they indicate (NGLE, (2009:â•›2838–2855), which are those that
can be expressed by deadjectival verbs, hence their interpretative paraphrases, such as
the link between hacerse and volverse to ser, or between ponerse and quedarse to estar.
We do not intend to propose more types of argument structures for deadjectival
verbs. We understand that there is an inchoative structure, paraphraseable as hacerse,
but with a wide variety of aspectual nuances which allow interpretations with Â�ponerse,
volverse or quedarse. They are somehow included when considering the interpreta-
tion using quedarse of a resultative value, closer, if possible, to the state verbs ser and
estar, just as we have also identified other aspectual values, like the state start, which
are not interpretable by a single verb, but by a paraphrase such as empezar a estar [to
begin to be].
The same kind of interpretation must be considered for causative variants of
hacer using poner, volver or dejar. They express aspectual values which deadjectival
Â�
causative verbs may indicate, and we interpreted the resultative content which they
may Â�
indicate as a greater closeness between these constructions (interpretable as
Â�
causative Â�
predicative constructions) and constructions interpretable as attributives
with ser and estar. State start values which causative constructions can indicate also
imply an approximation to the state.
4.5â•… Others
We will now go on to consider some cases which appear to move away from the pattern
of attributive conflations looked at so far. Thus, we have found four verbs that could
be linked to a pattern of motion, namely alzar97 [to lift], profundizar98 [to deepen] and
ahondar99 [to deepen] on the one hand, interpretable as desplazamiento a lo alto, a lo
profundo and a lo hondo [motion upwards, to the profound, and to the deep], and, on
the other hand adjuntar100 [to attach], interpretable as desplazamiento como adjunto
[motion as an attachment].
The first case, alzar, is a Latin formation, and perhaps, coming from the Latin
Â�adjective altus, from which altiāre and later alzar derive, is not transparent for the Â�average
Spanish speaker. In any case, we will analyze it from this derivational perspective.
The first information to consider is, according to Ernout and Meillet (1959), that
altiāre is not formed exactly on altus, -a, -um, but on the comparative, thus explaining
the possible duality of forms altō, -ās, replaced in Romance languages by altiō, -āre.
â•‡ïœ¹ïœ·.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To lift (move upwards).
â•‡ïœ¹ïœ¸.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To deepen.
â•‡ïœ¹ïœ¹.â•… DRAE: 3. tr. To introduce something deeply into something else.
ïœ±ïœ°ïœ°.â•… DRAE: 1. tr. To send, together with a letter or other document, notes, bills, samples.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¹ïœ·
This would be consistent with the first of the meanings found in Cuervo’s dictionary
for alzar: hacer más alto [to make higher]’. Considered in this way, it is not Â�
necessary
to resort to motion conflation to explain the verbal formation, since the meaning is
explained from the metonymic motivation of hacer más alto [to make higher]: the
quantification of that schema, from the comparison, as well as the measure provided
by the value of the adjective, gives dynamicity to the action and makes it easy to
Â�
understand motion and a change of place as consequences. I.e. desplazamiento a lo
alto [motion upwards] would be motivated by hacer más alto Y [to make Y higher];
Â�
therefore the DO attributive conflation would explain the verbal formation at the
source. Obviously, other meanings of alzar would be motivated from this meaning ‘to
lift’, as a result of hacer más alto.
Furthermore, there is a second explanation contributing, together with the
Â�
previous one, to strengthen the hypothesis of motivation: according to Cuervo
(1994), the meanings of alzar are divided into two groups, which correspond to the
two Â�
fundamental meanings of alto [high]: extended vertically and separated from the
ground. The first meaning of the first group is the one we pointed out earlier, ‘to make
higher’, while the first meaning of the second group is ‘to put on top, to move to the
top’. We will focus on the first part of this second meaning, ‘to put on top’. It is usual
in Spanish to use as a paraphrase of deadjectival formations poner X a Y [to turn Y
X], equivalent to those considered of process hacer X a Y [to make Y X], or of result
dejar X a Y [to leave Y X]. For example, ablandar [to soften] is defined in the DRAE as
poner blando algo [to turn something soft], acedar [to be sour] as poner acedo [to turn
sour], achatar [to flatten] as poner chato algo [to make something flat], etc. This means
it is an attributive process equivalent to hacer X a Y [to make X Y], and if the result is
focused, we can paraphrase it as poner [to turn] or more clearly with dejar [to leave].
I.e. the consequence of hacer más alto Y is the result of que Y quede alto [Y ending up
high]. The result can lead to a state, clearly a local state, due to the type of adjective
and process involved, and thus explain a change of position: poner alto a Y [to make Y
high] > poner en alto [to put on high]. Semantic sliding between the change of position
which poner entails and the motion it implies, make the current meaning of ‘to lift’ eas-
ily understandable by the proximity of meanings101.
Thus, this second explanation coincides with the first in considering the Â�conflation
hacer más alto a Y [to make Y higher], and both contribute to denying the need for a
differentiated pattern of semantic conflation specific for the case of alzar.
Profundizar [to deepen] or ahondar [to deepen] can be explained in exactly the
same way as alzar. Moreover, we must observe that ahondar is defined in the DRAE
as hacer más hondo Y [to make Y deeper]. We already discussed that there are many
ïœ±ïœ°ïœ±.â•… See Cifuentes, 1999:â•›73–81 on the matter.
ïœ¹ïœ¸	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
verbs expressing a quantification of the attributive schema, understood as hacer más
X a Y [to make Y more X], and this is the case especially with adjectives that indi-
cate dimension or size, like hondo [deep] or profundo [profound], as proven in the
Â�following examples:
	(84)	 y el que sembrare laderas: ahonde quanto mas pudiere la reja: 1513.
	(85)	
echara mugrones adobara vallados/ ahondara las açequias: çerrara portillos:
1513.
As we pointed out with alzar, the two above-mentioned hypotheses could act together
to cognitively derive from hacer más hondo [to make deeper] the motion meaning
of ahondar: the dynamism of the quantification could cause the idea of motion, by
Â�
metonymic linkage, and also by the idea of result which the local state of poner hondo
[to make deep]> dejar hondo [to leave deap]> estar hondo [to be deep]> Â�desplazamiento
hondo [deep motion] could give rise to.
Apart from the undeniable semantic relation between ahondar and profundizar,
the explanation for this last verb is exactly the same as for ahondar. Here we provide
some examples which illustrate the idea of hacer más profundo [to make deeper]:
	(86)	
assí que la natura no puede mouer la materia ni se puede el calor natural
Â�
profundar enla materia ni se puede enseñorear sobre ella & enella, assí
commo el sol quando fiere enla grand agua que no se puede mucho profundar
el su calor enella, 1495.
	(87)	
Vemos tambien por experiencia, que, con el curso de las aguas, y robo de las
arenas, se abren, y profundizan los Cauces de los Rios, 1755–1779.
Adjuntar [to attach] is somewhat different, because as shown in the examples which
are at the source of the verb, it does not necessarily have a directional sense, but is
Â�
perfectly interpretable as hacer adjunto a Y [to make Y attached], as well as other
Â�
values indicating result, poner/dejar adjunto [to put/leave attached], or state, estar
adjunto [to be attached]. If the DRAE’s meaning of ‘To send, together with a letter or
other document, notes, bills, samples, etc.’ should be considered in a sense of motion,
it seems perfectly possible that this is a consequence of the specialization of meaning
by combining it with the type of objects it affects (letters, texts, notes, etc.), which are
also subject to motion:
	(88)	
Y porque en el dicho juicio de la Cámara pendían al presente muchas causas
indecisas, consentían los Estados en favor á la justicia que Su Majestad,
demás del número acostumbrado, pudiese á sus costas de ellos adjuntar al
Â�
dicho juicio de la Cámara diez personas doctas por dos años y si necesario
fuese por tres, 1550.
	(89)	
Puso El Pardo en la perfeción que tenía, y le adjuntó las cuatro torres, galerías
y foso con jardines, imitando a una casa de campo, 1619.
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ¹ïœ¹
Therefore, adjuntar does not seem to require a different pattern of conflation to
the attributive pattern, which we have been generically discussing for all Spanish
Â�deadjectival verbs.
We are not going to comment on the possible values that might be shown in Â�certain
deadjectival verbs which include the value of a given prefix (des- or re- for example)
in their meaning, added to the attributive value of the respective conflation. These are
usually deadjectival verbs that give rise to a new verb by joining the prefix (reverdecer
[to become green again], recalentar [to reheat], desafear [to make less ugly], etc.), since
they do not add anything new except what can be said regarding the prefix.
5.â•… Conclusion
After the analysis of the different types of semantic conflation present in the formation
processes of Spanish deadjectival verbs, I would like to conclude that all patterns share
the same type of argument conflation: attributive conflation. I believe this to be so
despite the diversity mentioned and, especially, the fuzzy limits between patterns due
to intermediate examples between both, as well as there being verbs which, according
to meaning and context, show more than one type of conflation. In all analyzed cases
there is an adscription of a property, quality or state to a base of attribution, differing
in the base type and the kind of process involved.
Trying not to confuse the linguistic level of paraphrases and the conceptual
level of verbal formation, but taking it as the object of our analysis, we found that
there is some sort of attributive/predicative schema, either to subject or to DO, in
all the Â�
above-mentioned paraphrases. This is precisely what we aim to point out at
the Â�
conceptual level: there is one single argument schema – the attributive – with
Â�
differences according to the process involved and the attribution base.
There are some schemas that affect either the subject or the DO. Thus, hacerse
X, estar X, ser X, comportarse como X and quedarse X affect the subject. In turn,
hacer X and dejar X affect the DO. There is a third possibility in which, although the
Â�
attribution of the property affects the subject of the construction, a DO is required to
be the object of the activity developed by the subject. For these schemas we have the
variants ser X con or comportarse como X con. There also exists the possibility of some
three-Â�
argument verbal schemas, which, in any case, do not alter the specified schema.
Obviously when the attribution base is the subject, the construction is intransitive, and
when the attribution base is the DO, the construction is transitive. However, when the
attribution base is the subject, but requires a patient to receive the activity developed
by the subject, the construction is transitive.
A great problem is posed by pronominal verbs, i.e. those verbs that imply an
Â�obligatory pronominal increment which necessarily matches the subject. We Â�considered
ïœ±ïœ°ïœ°	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
these cases intransitive. However, their historical analysis shows that, in most cases,
they are reflexive transitive verbs, which makes it difficult to delimit the verbal schema
completely. But I actually do not consider this a problem, since the data shows Â�
precisely
the fuzzy boundaries between different subtypes and the high possibility of one same
element behaving in different ways, according to meaning and context, within the
attributive schema that precisely justifies all these possibilities.
Another interesting differentiating feature is to understand the verbal action as a
process, a state, or a result. Ser X and estar X obviously represent a state, however, hacer
X or hacerse X involve a process of state change. Similarly, comportarse como X also
indicates activity, although not a state change. Finally, with the paraphrases Â�
quedarse
X and dejar X (or poner X) we fundamentally note a result, i.e. a sort of Â�
halfway
point between activity and state, inasmuch as there is activity, but it is focused on the
Â�
endpoint, which leads to a state, and, sometimes, a state start. This aspectual content
was commented on in Section 3. The state start value is also signified through the
Â�
frequentative aspect, which we mentioned several times. Thus, the attributive schema
is a radial category, without precise limits, where a verb, according to the meaning and
context, has the possibility to cross from one schema to another without problems, as
we have seen in the examples of our analysis.
Process Result State State
Start
The last feature we want to use to account for the attributive category is the
Â�
attribution of a property, quality or state in a permanent or transitory way. The
boundaries between them are fuzzy and changeable, according to the context and
meanings. Estar X, comportarse como X, quedarse X or dejar X indicate the Â�attribution
of a temporarily property (although the latter two appear also to be able to do so
Â�permanently). Instead, hacer X, hacerse X or ser X indicate a more or less Â�
permanent
attribution. To highlight the flexibility of the limits of this duality, we consider, for
example, the difference between ser X and estar X: the grammatical construction
poses in itself many problems of demarcation in Spanish, but from a conceptual
viewpoint their differentiation is even more fuzzy. However, there can be (as in the
rest of differentiating elements) examples clearly linked to ser X and examples clearly
linked to the estar X paraphrase. Further proof of such flexibility could be to recon-
sider an example previously given: agringarse [to act like a foreigner]. Obviously,
stricto sensu, there are qualities which are obtained at birth, such as the place of
origin, so Â�
theoretically someone can comportarse como X but never llegar a ser X
[become X] (afrancesarse [become French], españolizar [make/become Spanish]),
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ±ïœ°ïœ±
as discussed above. However, this is a somewhat questionable constraint, because
someone canagringarse, afrancesarse or españolizar completely, so much so that they
can be considered a Â�
genuine gringo, French or Spanish person. I.e. according to the
conceptualization of the speaker, it is possible to produce a real state change, not
merely a behavior change, and thus to understand that Â�
someone se ha agringado,
afrancesado o españolizado completely, i.e. se ha hecho gringo, francés or español [has
become completely foreign, French or Spanish]. These verbs indicating Â�
provenance
from a place enable transitive and intransitive Â�
constructions (afrancesarse vs.
Â�
afrancesar); state change can be full or partial in either of the two possibilities, i.e.
limited either by time or by their characteristics: hacerse francés (total change) or
comportarse como francés (limited change), and hacer francés a X (total change) or to
make Y have a limited behavior as a French person. The limits, therefore, between a
more or less fortuitous behavior and a genuine state change are established, Â�according
to the context and meanings, by the speaker. And the speaker is lucky enough to
express that with one same deadjectival schema.
The representation of what we just stated can be drawn as follows:
Permanent Transitory Process Result Affected
Subject
Affected
Direct
Object
Possibility
of Affected
Patient
Hacer X + + +
Ser X + + +
Estar X + + (+)
Comportarse.
como X
+ + + +
Hacerse X + + + (+)
Quedarse X (+) + + + (+)
Dejar X (+) + + +
I would like to stress that, in spite of the diversity of conflations, I understand that
the attributive schema works for all examples, with different possibilities of Â�incidence or
focus,andtransitionsbetweenthem,aswellasvariouspossibilitiesofuse.Onesameverb
can be transitive or intransitive, pronominal or not, with or without an affected patient,
it can be a verb of process, result or state, with a permanent or Â�
temporary property. It
is the focus of the speaker, depending on the meaning and context of the construction,
which allows the configuration of one kind or another, or at an intermediate point,
because the speaker has at his disposal a wide range of possibilities Â�
provided by the
attributive schema, which is what the deadjectival verb expresses. Below we have tried
to represent this with all the identified transitions:
ïœ±ïœ°ïœ²	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia
Comportarse
(Perfective)
+Con Dejar
(Result)
To begin
to estar
[be]
3 Arguments
Hacer
(Imperfective)
Hacerse
(Imperfective)
Ser/estar
Quedarse
(Result)
Reflexive
Frequentative
(To begin to
estar [be]
+Con
To begin
to estar
[be]
Thus, the argument configuration of Spanish deadjectival verbs is organized in
the following categories and intermediates: it is possible to define a stative Â�
argument
structure, infrequent in Spanish, where it is sometimes necessary to distinguish
Â�
perfective behavior from imperfective behavior, represented by the paraphrase
ser + Adj. and estar + Adj., but normally they will belong to the fuzzy area of delimi-
tation. These are intransitive constructions where the attribution affects the subject.
This type of structure also makes constructions to require a patient on which the
attribution process developed by the verb rests. There is a second type of argument
structure – causative – paraphraseable as hacer + Adj. + Direct Object. It, in turn, can
develop aspectual variants leading to stative argument structures, which, somehow,
act as intermediaries with them (the paraphrase dejar + Adj. + Direct Object), as well
as frequentative and ingressive causative values which, in many cases, are indicated
by the verbs. The causative variant also allows constructions with three arguments,
and always makes for transitive constructions where the attribution base is the direct
object. The imperfective argument structure, hacerse + Adj., and perfective argument
structure, comportarse como + Adj. do not have clearly defined limits, as demonstrated
in the examples of verbs constructed from adjectives of origin or place. These two
structures are linked to stative constructions through formations Â�
indicating result,
with the variant quedarse, or the ingressive aspect, which constitute the bridge or
	 Spanish deadjectival verbs and argument structure	 ïœ±ïœ°ïœ³
intermediate step towards state. In all cases they are intransitive constructions, with
or without pronominalization, where the attribution base is the subject. Compor-
tarse como constructions also, clearly, allow argument schemas that require a patient
affected by the process developed by the verb, making the construction transitive,
in this case. Somehow, the intermediate point between causative constructions and
inchoative constructions should be Â�reflexive transitive constructions, which appear to
be at the origin of pronominal inchoative constructions.
In conclusion, therefore, and despite the reported argument diversity, it is possible
to understand a single argument schema in Spanish for deadjectival formations: the
attributive schema. The differences in the above-mentioned schemas come from the
impact on the subject or direct object, from the aspectual variations commented, and
from the possibility of more arguments.

Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs*
Ruth Lavale Ortiz
University of Alicante
This chapter focuses on the causative behavior of sensory emotional denominal
verbs. Under this label, as well as the so-called psychological or emotional verbs,
some other verbs are also included. These verbs may convey a physical change
of state or a psychological change of state, so they may be paraphrased as ‘to
cause + conflated noun’; the semantic content of the implicated bases seems
to strongly influence the final meaning of the resultant denominal verb.
Furthermore, as well as the causative component, sensory-emotional
denominal causative verbs carry some other meanings, such as location
or possession.
Keywords:â•‡ denominal causative verbs; argument structure; conflation;
sensory-emotional verbs
1.â•… Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to extend our study of denominal causative verbs. In
Lavale Ortiz (2007) we presented a provisional classification of this type of verbs after
the analysis of 150 denominal verbs. Currently, we have expanded the corpus to all
denominal verbs collected in the Diccionario de la lengua española (DRAE 2001). Since
the academic dictionary does not state in many of the entries whether or not a verb
derives from a noun, we have turned to the Diccionario crítico-etimológico Â�
castellano
e hispánico by J. Corominas and J.A. Pascual (DCECH 1980) to check whether the
verb came from the noun base or if, conversely, it was the verb that existed before
the noun. From this large set of denominal verbs, we have extracted those with a
Â�causative Â�meaning and, among them, we have discovered an interesting subset of those
Â�
considered in the literature as psychological verbs, emotional verbs, verbs of will or
understanding, etc.
*â•‡ This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science through
grant HUM2006–09429.
ïœ±ïœ°ïœ¸	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
Our purpose is to analyze this subset of denominal verbs with causative Â�meanings:
their lexical-semantic traits, their possible classification into different types, their
Â�syntactic behavior and their relation to other concepts such as location and Â�possession.
Prior to this analysis we will introduce two key aspects: what is a denominal verb and
what I mean by causative meaning.
1.1â•… Denominal verbs
Verbs from noun bases are formed by the classical procedures of word formation
Â�
(derivation and parasynthesis) and syntax-semantic conflation processes that make
it possible to synthesize content from different conceptual categories (verbal and
nominal) which together behave as a denominal verb. Therefore, in their formation
morphological, syntactic and semantic processes take place. We briefly explain these
procedures in the following sections.
1.1.1â•… 
Word formation: Derivation and parasynthesis
Methods of forming words in Spanish are varied and allow us to create words from
other existing ones or provide certain words with expressive or stylistic content.
The mechanisms to form new lexemes are mostly of a morphological type, since it
addresses the combination of words and other smaller units.
Forming denominal verbs involves processes that are under the general rubric
of addition. As Pena (1991:â•›
79–80) has pointed out, addition is the increase of the
base by adding external elements to it; within this overall process we differentiate
between affixation, which involves the addition of affixes, and composition, reflecting
the Â�
addition of one base. Denominal verbs are formed with the addition of affixes to a
base. Affixes, in turn, may be of various types, but we are mostly interested in prefixes
and suffixes to explain the formation of verbs we are talking about.
Prefixation and suffixation are under the term derivation. According to Lang
(1997:â•›
22), in derivation one of the components can not appear as an independent
lexeme – that is, the affix –, since it needs to be added to a base that does have syntactic
independence. In derivation, therefore, we join affixes that are either placed before
(prefixes: anteponer [to put before]), postponed (suffixes: calcificar [to calcify]) or
interspersed (infixes: mordisquear [to nibble]), to a base.
Along with prefixation and suffixation we find a miscellaneous procedure:
Â�
parasynthesis. Parasynthesis, according to Pena (1991:â•›116), is a particular kind of deri-
vation Â�
characterized by a double affixation: the simultaneous addition of a prefix and a
Â�
suffix. It is understood as a simultaneous addition because the language does not have
an intermediate base upon which to derive this formation with a single affix; this is the
case of words like enflaquecer [to grow skinny], because it is not possible to have a dual
process of *enflaco to which -ecer is later added, or of *flaquecer, to which en- is later
added. For the formation of denominal verbs, Lang (1997:â•›
221–222) acknowledges
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ°ïœ¹
that prefixation is usually accompanied by parasynthesis and, in these cases, there is
much debate as to whether prefixation plays a syntactic role by changing the category
of the base (i.e. participates in heterogeneous derivation, compared to the traditional
view that considers prefixation as a derivation of a homogeneous kind, which does
not change the category of the word). However, we agree with Lang that the change in
grammatical category is not a main feature of prefixation, but is a phenomenon typical
of parasynthesis.
As for the vitality of these word formation processes, we can say, following Lang
(1997:â•›57 and 242), that suffixation is the process that has greater vitality, followed by
prefixation and composition in more specific areas, like in the creation of Â�
compounds
consisting of verb and noun. Parasynthetic formations generating verbs from Â�adjectives
and nouns are also very productive formations, especially with the presence of the
Â�prefixes a-and en-, and the suffixes -izar, -ificar, -ar and -ecer.
In the formation of words through these morphological procedures we must take
into account a number of restrictions that apply to both the base and the word that
arises as a result. Lang (1997:â•›68–71) states that the base places a series of Â�restrictions on
syntax, because some affixes only attach to verbs, others only to nouns and Â�
others only
to adjectives, so it is not possible to apply any suffix to any base. As for the Â�
restrictions
that exist in the lexeme that results, Lang states that, syntactically, words that emerge
through a process of word formation must belong to the major lexical categories, i.e.
they must be nouns, adjectives, verbs or adverbs. On the other hand, from a semantic
point of view, the meaning of the word that results from a formation process depends
on the meaning that the constituents forming it have. It is a componential meaning,
so we can say that the meaning of the derived or compound word is predictable: it
depends on the meaning of each of the elements that constitute it. However, as Coseriu
(1978:â•›249–259) noted:
Las relaciones entre las bases a las que se aplican los procedimientos de
formación de palabras y sus productos resultan de la comparación semántica
entre estas bases y las equivalencias explícitas de los productos; así, beauté, con
respecto a beau(x) – belle(s), contiene las determinaciones complementarias
«predicatividad» y «sustantividad». Ello quiere decir que los productos de los
procedimientos formativos no son nunca equivalentes en el significado a las
bases a que se aplican y, por esta razón, tampoco pueden ser generados por
transformaciones que ‘conserven el significado’: los productos de la formación de
palabras contienen siempre más que sus respectivas bases léxicas.
The meaning, therefore, can be somewhat predictable, but the product that emerges
after the application of a rule of word formation will always have more Â�
meaningful
content than that of the independent elements that compose it. In any case, we should
not forget that there are pragmatic and contextual factors which also determine the
specific meanings of each lexical piece (Varela 1993:â•›
25) and that, over time, the
ïœ±ïœ±ïœ°	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
word may have meanings that are not predictable because they do not derive from its
Â�
components’ meanings (Portolés 1993:â•›
347). With this we are referring to semantic
changes that involve the lack of transparency of the original semantic motivation and
that are caused by semantic extension procedures such as metaphor and metonymy.
In the realm of verbalization, we note that bases from which we can form verbs
are varied, but they are mostly adjectival and nominal ones, although it is also Â�
possible
to create verbs from verbal bases, through the application of appreciative suffixes
or infixes. They are mainly formed through the processes mentioned above: verbal
Â�
derivation, which applies a verbalising suffix, and verbal parasynthesis, which applies
both a verbalising suffix and a prefix. Lang (1997:â•›213–214) notes that the number of
suffixes to create verbs is limited; productivity is restricted to -ar, -ear, -ficar, and -izar,
since ecer has a smaller productivity.1
Our analysis will focus on denominal verbs. According to Val Álvaro
(1994:â•›Â�
232–233), denominal verbs have two properties that are relevant to repre-
sent their semantic regularities and combining ability. The first is that they involve a
Â�
lexical formation process whereby a noun category is provided with verbal predicative
Â�
ability, and the second is that, from a morphological point of view, the procedures
and Â�
morphemes that allow their construction coincide with those used in deadjectival
verb formation. Denominal verbs are built, therefore, as deadjectival verbs, through
the same process and, in many cases, their meanings are similar, although noun and
Â�
adjective designate different entities: the noun base can highlight, not the object,
but its characteristic properties; it therefore coincides semantically with deadjectival
verbs. This explains the interpretation, for example, of abarquillar as ‘to shape like a
wafer’ (Val Álvaro 1992:â•›623 notes). In the process of formation of a denominal verb,
the noun is semantically conflated to a structure that contains the necessary elements
to have predicative ability and to express events of reality. The noun is attached to the
verb as an argument of a different nature and, therefore, the semantic relationship that
links the noun with the verb can be multiple. As noted by Pena (1993:â•›234), the noun
can be incorporated as:
(a) agentivo (asesor asesorar, asesino asesinar), (b) instrumental (cincel cincelar,
guadaña guadañar), (c) como argumento efectuado, interno o cognado implicado
por un agente (pacto pactar, parodia parodiar), (d) como argumento resultativo
aplicado por el agente a un tercer argumento (aceite aceitar, almidón almidonar,
alfombra alfombrar), (e) como experimentador en una estructura monoactancial
o biactancial (granizo granizar, nieve nevar, deseo desear, envidia envidiar), (f)
como argumento experimentador o como argumento resultativo causado según
quelaestructuraargumentalseaintransitiva(=incoativa)otransitiva(=causativa)
ïœ±.â•… For productivity of suffixes in English, see Plag (1999).
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ±ïœ±
(asustarse asustar, llenarse llenar, acongojarse acongojar, lesionarse lesionar, secarse
secar, etc.), (g) locativo (almacén almacenar, jaula enjaular), (h) modal (galope
galopar, porfía porfiar), etc.
This variety in the way of incorporating the noun to the verb means that the Â�
meanings
that denominal verbs can express are varied. In general, the types of content that
are expressed by denominal verbs are mainly six (Cifuentes 2006:â•›
249): causative,
Â�
inchoative, intrumental, agentive, local and privative. I am focusing on the study of
the causative content of denominal verbs (see Lavale 2007).
1.1.2â•… 
Incorporation and conflation
Incorporation and conflation procedures explain denominal verb formation from a
syntactic-semantic point of view.
Incorporation explains that a noun and a verb that acted independently join to
form a single lexeme. According to Cifuentes (2004:â•›95–96), incorporation implies that
an incorporated element restricts one of the thematic arguments of the Â�
predicate, i.e.
the verb and one of its arguments form a unit. Therefore, the elements of a Â�construction
can appear in an independent and distinct way in an analytical Â�
construction, or can
be expressed in a condensed or synthetic form after the Â�
incorporation process.2
Â�
Sometimes, as the author points out, the argument is incorporated into the verb and
is restricted so that the element encapsulated in the verb does not reappear (as, for
Â�
example, with the noun reflejos [reflections] in the verb reflejar [to reflect]: “La luz
se reflejaba en el agua” [The light was reflected in the water]). However, on other
Â�
occasions it is possible that the semantic relation between the simple word and the
derived word is lost, in the sense that there is no transparency, which allows the incor-
porated element to be subspecified (as in “Engrasó la puerta con aceite” [He greased
the door with oil], where oil would be the type of fat or grease used).
According to Gerdts (1998:â•›92–93), the incorporated noun is usually the Â�
subject
of a transitive predicate or the subject of an intransitive predicate, but oblique noun
phrases can also be incorporated. Furthermore, the incorporation decreases the
ïœ².â•… The relationship between analytic and synthetic constructions has been widely discussed.
In our work we use this relationship as an explanatory tool: the analytic formation (in the
case of causative verbs, the structure hacer/causar + infinitivo [to make/cause + infinitive],
as in hacer mención (to make mention) or causar emoción (to cause emotion) can serve as a
paraphrase to explain the content of the synthetic form and the argument relations that occur
in the denominal verb (mencionar [to mention],emocionar [to touch]).Although the contents
that both structures express are not comparable, the fact is that the two are related. However,
the analytical paraphrase cannot be considered as the origin or basis on which the syntactic
expression is formed (see, in this regard, Cano 1977:â•›
241; Serrano 1995:â•›
107, 110; Cifuentes
2004:â•›107; Val Álvaro 1994:â•›232, among others).
ïœ±ïœ±ïœ²	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
Â�sentence valency with respect to the analytic structure (incorporation by composition,
according to the author) but, as we have seen, a complement can appear specifying the
incorporated noun (incorporation by classification).
As Cifuentes points out (1999:â•›138–139), denominal verbs show a Â�
morphological
incorporation, in which the noun, as a verbal morpheme, is morphologically and
Â�phonetically integrated into the verb, and they form a phonetic, semantic and Â�syntactic
unit. In denominal verb incorporation, there is an integration of elements into other
linguistic units as a result of the application of the rule move α by which the noun
moves from the subject position to the verb. Both the generative and cognitive Â�models
recognize that the structures poner grasa en [to put grease on] and engrasar [to grease]
are not semantically and syntactically equivalent, but both derive from a Â�
common
structure or pre-conceptual level, although the resulting verb presents a Â�
special mor-
phosyntax because it is a complex unit.
Other authors such as Beniers (2002:â•›407) believe that denominal verbs can not
be described as the result of an incorporation process. She notes syntactic Â�
similarities
between the incorporation procedure and the derivation of a verb from a noun –
for example, the consideration of the base noun as an argument –, but warns of the
Â�morphological differences, since, in the formation of denominal verbs, there is no verb
prior to the supposed incorporation with a restrictable meaning, but this is the case in
incorporation. However, there are similarities between the two processes:
Ya Kenneth Hale y Samuel J. Keyser comprobaron que los principios establecidos
por los generativistas para la incorporación se dan también en la formación de
verbos denominales. Lo importante es que en el momento de constituir un verbo
denominal, lo mismo que para interpretarlo, se requiere asumir una relación
semántico-sintáctica con el sustantivo contenido; desde luego, ésta es mucho más
abierta que la del sustantivo incorporado por no tener a un lado al verbo que sirve
de contexto definitorio explícito en la incorporación. (Beniers 2002:â•›407–408)
At the end of the article, Beniers recognizes that denominal verb formation and
Â�
incorporation are procedures that share features from a syntactic point of view, but,
morphologically, they are different processes. This conclusion is not entirely at odds
with our hypothesis regarding the possibility of explaining denominal verb formation
from three perspectives: by morphological processes of word formation; syntactically,
as a result of incorporation; and, semantically, as we see below, as a conflation process.
From a semantic point of view, the formation of denominal verbs can be explained
by the conflation procedure. The term conflation refers to the linguistic condensation
of elements, which were individually and independently manifested into a single form.
It is therefore a concept similar to incorporation, but there are differences among
them: while incorporation focuses on the syntactic description of the union of the
verb and its argument – i.e. it is interested in the morphosyntactic consequences of this
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ±ïœ³
process and conserves a differentiation between the elements affected –, conflation
focuses on the lexical-conceptual implications of this union, as the morphosyntactic
consequences are the loss of independence of the elements and the passing from a
noun to a verb.3
Incorporation, therefore, takes into account morphosyntactic factors and confla-
tion focuses on the semantic factors that occur after the melting process. Semantic
factors are crucial to the understanding of this process, since the condensation of the
elements may cause the meanings of the elements merged and their relationship not
to be transparent in the new verb. Therefore, the term conflation would include that of
incorporation.
1.2â•… Causativity
Causativity is a semantic category that humans use to understand the world, so it is
an essential cognitive element. Authors such as Fillmore (1976:â•›
182) claim that the
abstract category of causality is a universal principle that can be reflected and expressed
in all languages in the world.4 This concept of physical or real world shows that events
do not occur in isolation, i.e. without the presence of a cause, meaning that cause
and effect are inseparable. Linguistic causativity allows us to differentiate events that
happen by themselves (not causative) and those that are the result of another event
(causative); it allows us to express how speakers conceive the relationship between
the different events that happen in extra-linguistic reality and becomes a cognitive
Â�
component that allows us to categorize reality. Therefore, while in the physical world
all phenomena constitute a causal continuum, in the field of language we are able
to break this Â�
continuum and to display events that occur on their own, without the
Â�
presence of causal relations (Talmy 1976:â•›47; Rifón 1997:â•›81).
Causative content is, as Levy points out (1991:â•›365), an implication of the verb to
its arguments, given that there is a verbal process in which an entity (object) Â�undergoes
a change as a result of the action of a cause (subject). As pointed out by Moreno Cabrera
(1993:â•›
155–159), the causative content would consist of three Â�
semantic Â�
primitives:
strength, intention or purpose and transition. The semantic primitive of transition
denotes that an entity that has a property acquires a new property related to the
Â�
causative event. This primitive is completely linked to strength, because this Â�
transition
occurs if the cause element exerts some strength. Additionally, the cause may have
the intention or purpose of carrying out the action; the latter primitive is usually
ïœ³.â•… See, in this regard, Cifuentes (2006:â•›263).
ïœ´.â•… Podlesskaya (1993:â•›165) argues that causation is an essential semantic relation that reflects
a universal logic concept. Zubizarreta (1985:â•›287) and Demonte (2002:â•›5) talk about semantic
primitive.
ïœ±ïœ±ïœ´	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
Â�associated with human and agentive entities. Therefore, the causative Â�content needs, in
order to be updated, the presence of a force (encoded as a syntactic Â�subject) that causes
the change, and a change of state or transition to be produced in an entity (the direct
object) as a result of the performance of the cause subject. This Â�
semantic Â�
configuration
of the concept requires a precise syntactic manifestation, since a Â�
transitive or biactan-
tial scheme is necessary, in which the two arguments of the Â�
definition are expressed.
The overall causative situation includes, in turn, two situations: the cause and the effect
or result, so we could speak of a complex situation consisting of a causing subevent and
a caused subevent (Comrie 1989:â•›236):
	(1)	
John broke the vase.
In this example we see a causing subevent, which refers to the cause that made the
event occur (John), and a caused subevent, which specifies the change of state that
occurs in the argument that undergoes the change (the vase).
The term causative has been extended to other domains through the generaliza-
tion of the concept of Force Dynamics by L. Talmy (1988, 2000). In this framework
he includes semantic concepts such as permission, impediment, help and others not
traditionally considered under the causative label. All these semantic relationships
are explained by how different entities interact with respect to the strength factor.
Â�
According to Talmy (2000:â•›413–419), there are two entities that exert the force: one
(the agonist, which corresponds to the caused event) that is the centre of attention
and focuses on whether the entity is able to manifest its intrinsic tendendy of strength
(towards motion or rest) or if this strength is overcome; the other entity of force (the
antagonist, which corresponds to the cause) is considered in relation to what it does
to the first entity, i.e. if it can overcome it or not. We speak of causation when the
resulting state of the agonist after the collision of forces is the opposite to the trend
it intrinsically has and when the stronger entity is the antagonist (without its perfor-
mance the change could not occur). At the opposite side is permission; in permission
the two Â�
entities do not affect each other, because the agonist has the same state as that
of its natural tendency (the agonist is the stronger entity here). This system allows
the Â�
concept of causativity to be extrapolated to the domains of psychology (the study
of the divided mind), social relations (the pressure between individuals to perform
certain actions) and speech (argumentation). Nevertheless, causation in the physical
world is different to causation in mental, social and discursive domains: in the latter,
the relationships are more complex and less direct, because there is no immediate
Â�
connection or physical contact between entities, and the relationship is more indirect,
as occurs between minds and words.
The notion of causativity can be expressed in Spanish through different
Â�
grammatical elements: prepositions, conjunctions, verbs and periphrasis (Aranda
1990:â•›9), but we are interested in verbal lexemes. Verbs, by adding certain morphemes
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ±ïœµ
or affixes, with their own semantic or syntactic combination, can express a causative
content. We distinguish, therefore, analytic or periphrastic causative predicates, lexical
causative predicates and morphological causative predicates. The first ones correspond
to the analytic causative and the rest form the synthetic causative group.
Analytical causative constructions (periphrastic or syntactic) are those that arise
by combining two verbs. The most basic and productive is hacer + infinitivo [to make
+ infinitive], also called romance causative; it is characterized by expressing a Â�
process
in which the momentum of implementing the action comes from the subject, but
the action is really carried out by the complement of the construction.5 This type of
causative expresses an indirect causation, because the subject does not perform the
action directly,6 but tells another entity to carry out the action, so that the relationship
between cause and effect is indirect. Thus, in a case like:
	(2)	
Howard made David tidy his room.
we understand that Howard is not who directly executes the action, but he orders
David to perform the action. In Spanish, these constructions are biclausal Â�
sentences,
in which the two verbs behave like two separate syntactic units.7 In this type of
Â�
causative we have separate predicates to express the notion of causality and the effect
Â�
predicate (Comrie 1989:â•›
238), so that we would have a cause expressed by make
(as in our Â�
example: “Howard made David do something”) and an effect, indicated by
the Â�
infinitive (“to tidy his room”); this semantic indication, coupled with the fact that
the verb does not lose its ability to react or its semantic causativity content, supports
the treatment of these constructions as biclausal.
Lexical causative predicates have the causative content embedded in their own
Â�
verbal meaning in a single lexical item. This causative, unlike the previous kind,
expresses direct or immediate causation, because cause and effect interact Â�immediately
and directly. In Spanish, there are two different lexical causatives: verbs that have
an exactly causative meaning and those that have a verbal counterpart to form a
Â�lexicalized pair.
Verbs that have an exactly causative meaning are lexemes of a predicative
nature whose meaning is inherently causative, such as causar [to cause], provocar
ïœµ.â•… See Aranda (1990:â•›174) and Cano (1981:â•›137).
ïœ¶.â•… Regarding English, see, for example, Talmy (2000:â•›426), Heringer (1976; 207 note) or King
(1988:â•›557) and, for Spanish, Aranda (1990:â•›176) or Cano (1981:â•›245–246).
ïœ·.â•… Authors such as Comrie (1976:â•›296) argue in defense of a monoclausal analysis for these
structures and state that when a verb and an infinitive form a causative construction, the two
form a cohesive unit; in this view, the verb hacer acts as a kind of affix like that of the verbal
periphrasis.
ïœ±ïœ±ïœ¶	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
[to Â�provoke], originar [to originate], motivar [to bring about/cause], suscitar [to
arouse], among Â�
others. With human and agentive subjects, the constructions with
these verbs are characterized by semantic indetermination; so a case such as:
	(3)	
Howard caused the poisoning of Max.
produces three interpretations: Howard is a cause or direct agent performing the action
voluntarily; Howard is an agent or indirect subject that does not perform the action
directly, but orders an intermediate entity to perform it; and Howard is an unconscious
and involuntary indirect cause responsible for the realization of the action. Moreover,
this general meaning of cause is not found in the other verbs mentioned above, since
each one has its particular semantic nuances; thus, for example, provoke is defined as ‘To
incite, induce someone to carry something out. // 2. To irritate or stimulate someone with
words or deeds to make them angry’ (DRAE 2001) and is characterized by Â�
expressing
a hint of coercion or obligation which is not present in to cause (‘Regarding a cause: to
produce an effect. // 2. To be the cause or reason for something to happen [DRAE 2001]).
Thus, it is claimed that causar expresses causativity in a neutral and general way.
In turn, lexicalized pairs form a set of lists of verbs in paradigmatic opposition, so
that between each pair we should find the causative meaning against the non-causative
sense in two different verbal units. In English it is common to illustrate the lexicalized
pair with kill and die, as Comrie points out (1985:â•›331): “kill is thus the lexical causative
of die”; kill indicates that a subject performs the subordinated action indicated by die.
These pairs are also syntactically opposed: while one, in this case kill, is transitive, the
other, die, occurs in intransitive structures. In Spanish, Aranda (1990:â•›96–109) makes
a classification of these pairs in which he opposes transitive and intransitive verbs, like
kill-die, and trivalent-bivalent transitive verbs, such as dar-recibir [give-receive] or ense-
ñar-aprender [teach-learn]. In these pairs, Aranda states that causativity is the semantic
property according to which the lexical distinctions are established, and, of course, a
content structured by our language, insofar as various lexical oppositions being referred
to it. One member of the pair expresses the process itself (like die or learn) and the other
expresses the process integrated in a cause-effect relation (kill or teach).
Within the group of lexical causative verbs, some authors include perception and
emotional verbs. Perception verbs are those that mean ‘to make someone see (know)
something’ (Cano 1981:â•›174), and they can refer to physical perception, such as mostrar
[to show], or to intellectual perception, such as convencer [to convince]. Emotional
causative verbs are verbs such as alegrar [to make happy], enfadar [to angry], emocionar
[to touch], molestar [to bother] or preocupar [to worry]. These verbs cause or provoke
a certain state in the complement which, therefore, becomes the new state indicated
by the verb. As the DRAE (2001) points out, we can paraphrase them with causar [to
cause] followed by the noun conflated in the verb: ‘causar alegría, enfado, emoción,
molestia, preocupación’ [to cause happiness, anger, emotion, trouble, concern]. It is this
type of verbs with noun bases on which we will focus in the following section.
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ±ïœ·
Finally, morphological causative predicates are characterized by expressing a
Â�
causative meaning derived from the addition of an affix to a base, although in most
cases the causative content is not deduced only from the affix (in some cases, such as
with -izar or -ificar, the causative content is obvious, but other affixes are Â�
polysemic,
and causativity is not expressed so explicitly), but it is also relevant to consider the
meaning of the base and the union of base and affix to interpret the causative Â�
meaning
(Rifón 1997:â•›
7). In the formation of morphological causative verbs derivation and
parasynthesis are involved. In this verbalization process, affixes are applied to bases
belonging to different categories, although the most productive are adjectives and
nouns. Within the process of verbal derivation which forms verbs from adjetive or
noun bases, it is worth noting the suffixes -ar, -ear, -ecer, -ificar and -izar,8 and, in the
case of parasynthesis, a…ar, en…ar, en…ecer, a…ecer, a…izar schemes (but also the
prefixes des- and re-).9 With these elements it is possible to create verbs with Â�
causative
values although, as we said earlier, we must take into account both the derivative or
parasynthetic scheme and the semantic content of the base, which is crucial to establish
the meaning of the final verb. From a semantic point of view, this causative expresses
direct causation, because subject and complement directly interact.
The causative meaning is more typical of deadjectival verbs than of denominal
verbs, because adjectives have the property of indicating qualities, actions, states or
phenomena – so, this name is given to those words applied to the noun to express a
quality of the object designated by it or to determine it (Moliner 2002) – and nouns
express the substance itself. Causativity expresses a change of state in a base that
Â�
happens to have a state different from the one that it had, and the expression of a
new state or quality in the base is more typical of the adjective than of the noun,
because the adjective, by definition, expresses qualities, states or properties that can
be interpreted as states. However, there are many denominal verbs that express a
causative content10 and the proof is in the sensory-emotional causative verbs which
follow.

What verbs are included under the label “sensory-emotional causative”?
Causation, as seen above, is the transfer of strength or energy from one entity to
another and, consequently, the change of state suffered by the participant that acts as

the object. However, there are other situations that are variants of this basic causative.
Thus, Croft (apud Santos & Espinosa 1996:â•›107–108) distinguishes physical, volitional,
affective and inductive causation:
La causación física es la interacción de dos entidades no volitivas de modo que
la una afecta a la otra (por ejemplo, la pelota rompió el cristal). En la volitiva
tenemos un instigador con capacidad mental que actúa deliberadamente sobre
una entidad física (Juan rompió el cristal). La afectiva supone un objeto físico o
estado de cosas que produce un cambio (emocional, cognitivo, perceptivo) en
una entidad que posee capacidad mental (La situación económica preocupa a
Juan). Finalmente, la inductiva implica un iniciador con capacidad mental que
influye sobre otro individuo con esa misma característica (Juan convenció a Pedro
para ir al cine). De todas ellas, la causación prototípica es la volitiva.
Verbs that are included under the label of sensory-emotional causatives would be
Â�
characterized, mostly, by expressing affective and inductive causation, because a
human or inanimate subject causes a human or animate object to experience a Â�physical
sensation or feeling. However, the physical change of state may also be undergone by
an inanimate entity, hence the reason we can also find volitional causation and, in rare
cases, physical causation, because it is common for the change to be produced by an
entity with mental capacity.
In most cases, the change is emotional and cognitive, hence there being a large
subset of these verbs known in the literature as psychological or emotional verbs.Â�
However,wealsofindothercasesinwhichtheeffectonthebaseisnotjustÂ�psychological,
but can also be a physical change. The latter are clear causative verbs, since a change of
physical state occurs in an entity, but the entity that undergoes such a change can be
an object or a thing, as in the basic causative, or a human. Â�
Psychological or Â�
emotional
Â�
predicates have also received a causative treatment in the literature. For example,
in French, Â�
Martinelli (1984:â•›
197) notes that “les verbes comme Â�
angoisser ont un
Â�comportementsyntaxiqueliéàunenotiondecausatif”andFeigenbaum(1992:â•›41)states
that “le sujet du verbe psychologique entretient une relation causative avec son objet
direct”. For English, authors such as Â�Howard (2001) assert the existence of Â�“experiencer
causatives”, of the amuse type, which are an exception to the restriction of physical
contact that is obligatory throughout lexical causatives. According to the author, these
causatives do not involve physical contact, but follow the pattern of “the experiencing
of a Â�
stimulus and the consequent psychological reaction, which is assumed to follow
inevitably from the experiencer’s psychic make-up”. In Spanish, it is also Â�
recognized
that Â�
psych-verbs are causative. For example, Demonte (2002:â•›
14–19) proposes a
Â�lexical-syntactic classification of verbal predicates in Spanish. She includes, in the class
named A of “mediate indirect or external causation”, among others, change of state
verbs in which the change occurs for reasons inherent to the object affected, but what is
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ±ïœ¹
essentialisthattheremustbeatriggeringfactor;theseverbscanparticipateinÂ�causative-
inchoative alternation. In this class, the affected object undergoes a physical or
Â�
psychological change. In verbs of affection or mental change V. Demonte includes
Â�
“agentive causative psychological change of state”, such as emocionar/Â�emocionarse
[to touch/to get excited] or alegrar/alegrarse [to make happy/be happy] and “stative
Â�
causative Â�
psychological change of state”, the same as those exemplified above and
that she exemplifies with asustar/asustarse [to frighten/get frightened]. By Â�
indicating
another source for Spanish, the classic study by R. Cano (1981) on the syntactic
Â�
structures of Spanish transitive verbs also notes that mental or psychic action verbs
would be a kind of emotional causative; in these verbs the object is characterized
as [+animate] and, specifically, [+human], and the subject is interpreted as a cause
or agent; Cano exemplifies them with alegrar/alegrarse [to make happy/be happy],
Â�
enfadar/enfadarse [to make angry/get angry]. Also, R. Cano indicates that in this group
of verbs with an affected object we can also include, due to their identical Â�
syntactic
behavior, verbs like cansar (to tire) and fatigar (to wear out), which refer essentially
to physical Â�
phenomena, and actions that imply a relationship between human beings,
such as engañar [to deceive], traicionar [to betray] or agraviar [to offend], in which the
subject can be interpreted as a cause (1981:â•›66–67).
To better understand this type of verbs, we explain what kind of noun bases are on
the basis of their formation and what groups we can differentiate.

Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs:
Syntactic-semantic features
In our provisional classification of denominal causative verbs (Lavale 2007:â•›197–205)
we differentiated a group called causative (provocation + experimentation). These
verbs include lexemes such as aficionar [to cause love], beneficiar [to benefit], agobiar
[to overwhelm], alarmar [to alarm], alborozar [to cause joy], amapolar [to blush],
Â�
angustiar [to distress], asfixiar [to asphyxiate], azorar [to embarrass], calmar [to calm],
etc. These verbs express a change of state that is induced or provoked by a cause; this
change of state is experienced, in most verbs, by a human or animate object with the
ability to feel the sensation or feeling that is created with the update of the action and
that is incorporated into the synthetic verb. In almost all verbs, the contact that occurs
between the two entities, the subject and the object, is mental, but we also see physical
changes undergone by an animate entity. This group of verbs, which we now extend
and clarify, is what we will treat as sensory-emotional causative verbs.
Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs are characterized for causing a
Â�
certain state in the complement that, therefore, obtains the new state which the verb
indicates; this new state may be a physical change (in an animate or inanimate entity
that acts as an object) or a mental, sentimental or emotional change of state (in an
ïœ±ïœ²ïœ°	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
animate entity). The meaning of these verbs can be paraphrased, as the DRAE (2001)
shows on many occasions, with the verb causar [to cause] followed by the noun
Â�
conflated into the verb:
angustiar [to distress]: ‘cause distress’
apasionar [to fascinate]: ‘cause, excite passion’
apenar [to sadden]: ‘cause grief’
apesadumbrar [to sadden]: ‘cause grief (discomfort, anxiety, physical or
psychological suffering)’
apestar [to stink]: ‘cause, transmit fever, inflect with the plague’
aplagar [to plague]: ‘cause plagues (ulcers, sores)’
asquear [to disgust]: ‘cause disgust’
aterrorizar [to terrorize]: ‘cause terror’
avergonzar [to shame]: ‘cause embarrassment/shame’
contusionar [to bruise]: ‘cause bruising (damage by bumping)’
emocionar [to touch/move]: ‘cause emotion’
empavorecer [to terrify]: ‘cause terror’
infartar [to cause heart attack]: ‘cause a heart attack’
lesionar [to injure]: ‘cause injury’
We have checked in the Diccionario crítico-etimológico castellano e hispánico by
J. Â�
Corominas and J.A. Pascual that these verbs come from nouns. The causative
Â�
meaning is conflated in its verbal semantics and this content comes through the
Â�
meaning Â�
provided by the verbalizing suffix and through the significant contribution
made by the noun base upon which the denominal verb results.
Interestingly, for a verb to express a causative content, it is stated that the base must
denote a state, as causativity is characterized by a change of state in a base. Â�
Typically,
the bases that are more propitious to express this semantic content are Â�adjectives, as we
said at the beginning of this article, because adjectives express Â�
qualities, actions, states
or phenomena. However, A. Rifón (1997:â•›126) also states that we can form verbs to
indicate that an Agent or Cause makes a Patient or Experiencer posses Â�
characteristics
or qualities of the kind designated by the base noun if we take two types of nouns
as a base: those that designate a state (for example, verbs like calmar [to calm], in
which the noun denotes a state of calma [calm]) and those designating an object
that is interpreted as a state (as in the case of abarquillar [to warp] in which the base
barquillo [wafer] is interpreted as a state ‘to change to take the form of wafers’). Ser-
rano (1995:â•›117–118) points out the same idea:
mientras que un adjetivo expresa una «cualidad» (entendida en un sentido
amplio), un sustantivo denota un «objeto», entendido éste como animal, persona,
cosa, etc. De ahí se deduce que la fórmula definitoria de este tipo de verbos
deberá ser: «adquirir o hacer adquirir las características propias y definitorias del
“objeto” designado por el sustantivo base».
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ²ïœ±
This applies, for example, to verbs such as aflautar [top put on a high-pitched voice]:
aflautar la voz does not imply turning one’s voice into a flute, but using it such that it
sounds like or has some qualities similar to those of a flute. Therefore, the noun base
can refer to the properties or characteristics of the object and not to the object itself,
sharing, therefore, the proper meaning of adjectives. Oyharçábal (2003), in his study
of lexical causatives in Basque, recognizes that verbs denoting physical states often
have an adjective as a base: (delgado [thin], grande [big], caliente [hot], gordo [fat],
pequeño [small], ancho [wide], etc.), but that
verbs formed from words that express psych-states denote changes-of-state too,
but are mostly derived from nouns, such as ahalke “shame”, arrangura “worry,
preoccupation”, asper “boredom”, beldur “fear”, griña “passion”, izu “fright”, kezka
“concern”, poz “pleasure, happiness”, etc.
In the sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs analyzed we note that we can
make a distinction in meaning of the noun bases that form these lexemes. If we divide
the bases according to whether the base alludes to a physical or psychological change,
we note the following classification:11
Psychic Physical
moral sensation physical sensation
feeling disease or symptom
result of moral aggression result of physical aggression
result result
The bases of psychological type verbs are characterized by expressing emotions,
sensations and feelings that relate to typical states of animate entities and, above all,
human ones. Thus, within the group of moral feelings12 we find verbs derived from
nouns such as the following ones:
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… We must keep in mind that some bases have several meanings and may be inserted into
several groups according to the precise meaning we use at any time. For example, we can
Â�
interpret the noun base of the verb apestar [to stink] as“physical sensation”, because the noun
can be interpreted as the meaning ‘thing that causes serious harm’,‘corruption’ or ‘bad smell’,
but it can also be interpreted within the disease group if we take the meaning of the base
plague‘disease that causes death’. In this case, we would have a verb that moves within physical
change, but we have others who may be in both columns; for example, from pesadumbre
[grief] we can form apesadumbrar [to sadden] and the noun can be interpreted as‘discomfort,
anxiety, physical or moral suffering’, so it can be a physical or psychic sensation verb.
ïœ±ïœ².â•… When it comes to showing the group to which each base belongs, we note only the
meaning that the noun has in that group. Some verbs, according to the meaning that is taken,
can be classified into one group or another (see the previous note).
ïœ±ïœ²ïœ²	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
bochorno [embarrassment] (abochornar [to embarrass]): ‘discomfort, anxiety,
blushing of the face’
pesadumbre [grief] (apesadumbrar [to sadden]): ‘discomfort, anxiety,
psychological suffering’
asco [disgust] (asquear [to disgust]): ‘unpleasant impression’
decepción [disappointment] (decepcionar [to disappoint]): ‘deception’
desazón [anxiety] (desazonar [to cause anxiety]): ‘disgust, anger, discomfort’
emoción [emotion] (emocionar [to touch/move]): ‘intense mood-altering’
pavor [terror] (empavorecer [to terrify]): ‘fright/shock’
necesidad [necessity] (necesitar [to need]): ‘irresistible impulse, lack of something’
paladar [palate] (paladear [to savour]): ‘taste, sensitivity to enjoy or repulse
something’
vigor [vigour/force] (vigorizar [to energize]): ‘strength, courage, vivacity, effort’
In the case of bases which express a feeling, we find a large number of nouns that refer
to the field of human emotions and to the effects or reactions that they have in the
bases that experiment them:13
ira [fury] (airar [to enfuriate]): ‘passion of the soul, anger, indignation, desire for
revenge, fury’
alborozo [joy] (alborozar [to cause joy]): ‘joy, pleasure’
angustia [distress] (angustiar [to distress]): ‘grief, anguish’
pasión [passion] (apasionar [to fascinate]): ‘affection, inclination, love/hobby’
pena [sadness] (apenar [to sadden]): ‘distress, internal feeling, shame’
piedad [pity] (apiadar [to pity]): ‘under tender devotion, deep love, pity,
compassion’
temor [fear] (atemorizar [to frighten]): ‘mood passion, presumption or suspicion’
terror [terror] (aterrorizar [to terrorize]): ‘intensive fear’
vergüenza [shame] (avergonzar [to shame]): ‘self-respect, shame’
calma [calm](calmar [to calm]): ‘peace, tranquility’
decepción [disappointment] (decepcionar [to disappoint]): ‘disappointment, regret’
amor [love] (enamorar [to fall in love]): ‘strong feeling, affection, inclination, love’
cólera [anger] (encolerizar [to infuriate/anger]): ‘anger, rage’
entusiasmo [enthusiasm] (entusiasmar [to delight]): ‘exaltation, enormous
enthusiasm, admiration’
fervor [fervour] (fervorar [to cause fervour]): ‘zeal, enthusiasm, burning’
ïœ±ïœ³.â•… Authors such as Pérez Rull (2001:â•›358–359) indicate that we can structure the Â�
conceptual
domain of emotion “mediante el modelo general de causa-efecto, que tiene en cuenta la
Â�
fenomenología externa de la emoción” and aims to explain the process by metonymy:
Â�
“comprender los conceptos de emoción teniendo en cuenta los efectos producidos en el
Â�
individuo”, so that “la causa emotiva golpea y rompe el corazón de la persona afectada de la
misma forma que alguien golpea y rompe un objeto físico”.
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ²ïœ³
In other cases, the base refers to the result that provokes a moral attack in a lively
Â�
individual or entity. Thus, we can find some examples like:
perro [dog] (aperrear [to hurt]): ‘evil or harm caused to someone by cheating in
an agreement or pact’
clavo [nail] (enclavar [to hurt]): ‘severe pain that afflicts the heart’
martirio [martyrdom] (martiriar [to cause martyrdom]): ‘death, suffered torture,
pain, psychological suffering’
oprobio [opprobrium] (oprobiar [to shame]): ‘public contempt, offence, disgrace’
solaz [relaxation] (solacear [to relax]): ‘comfort, relief’
tortura [torture] (torturar [to torture]): ‘severe psychological pain inflicted on
someone’
We also discover a few verbs that refer to the effect or result that occurs after the action
caused by the subject. This result or effect is also a concept that has to do with the
psychological realm and affects human or animate entities. This applies, for example,
to the following nouns:
vergüenza [shame] (avergonzar [to shame]): ‘penalty or punishment that was to
expose the offender to public outrage and confusion, a sign denoting their crime’
rebato [shock] (rebatar [to shock]): ‘alarm or commotion caused by a sudden event’
resabio [bad habit] (resabiar [to develop bad habits]): ‘vice or bad habit’
traición [treason] (traicionar [to betray]): ‘fault committed, crime’
On the other hand, there are verbs expressing a caused physical change. Bases that
form these verbs denote physical states that affect inanimate entities or that can be
experimented by animate entities. A large group is formed by those bases that refer to
physical sensations:
calambre [cramp] (acalambrar [to cause cramp]): ‘painful contraction, shivering’
calor [heat] (acalorar [to heat]): ‘sensation of burning, activity’
gana [appetite] (aganar [to cause appetite]): ‘appetite’
ahíto [sated] (ahitar [to be sated]): ‘indigestion’
anquilosis [ankylosis] (anquilosar [to cause ankylosis]): ‘reduced movement’
pesadumbre [grief] (apesadumbrar [to sadden]): ‘discomfort, anxiety, physical
suffering’
presura [hurry] (apresurar [to hurry]): ‘oppression, speed, lightness’
asfixia [asphyxia] (asfixiar [to asphyxiate]): ‘difficulty breathing, overwhelmed
feeling’
pereza [laziness] (emperezar [to cause laziness]): ‘boredom, carelessness, looseness’
hambre [hunger] (hambrear [to starve]): ‘desire to eat, appetite’
pasmo [awe] (pasmar [to cause awe]): ‘stiffness and muscle tension’
resabio [bad aftertaste] (resabiar [to savour]): ‘bad or unpleasant aftertaste’
Similarly, we find many bases that indicate disease or symptoms that are experimented
by human bodies, animate entities or vital organs:
ïœ±ïœ²ïœ´	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
catarro [cold] (acatarrar [to catch a cold]): ‘inflammation of the mucous
membranes’
peste [plague] (apestar [to stink]): ‘disease causing death’
atrofia [atrophy] (atrofiar [to cause atrophy]): ‘lack of development in one part
of the body’
caries [caries] (cariar [to cause caries]): ‘destruction of hard tissue’
contagio [infection] (contagiar [to infect/transmit]): ‘contagious disease’
cólera [cholera] (encolerizar [to cause cholera]): ‘epidemic disease’
infarto [heart attack] (infartar [to cause heart attack]): ‘increase of a diseased
organ, necrosis’
meteorismo [meteorism] (meteorizar [to cause meteorism]): ‘belly bulging due to
gas accumulated in the gut’
pasmo [awe] (pasmar [to cause awe]): ‘tetanus disease’
salto [jump] (saltear [to skip]): ‘palpitation of the heart’
As well as verbs of a psychological kind, we also discover bases denoting the effect or
result that an aggression has on the object, but in this case, of a physical type:
plaga [plague] (aplagar [to plague]): ‘ulcer, sore’
ruina [ruin] (arruinar [to ruin]): ‘destruction, ruin, decay, big loss’
avería [breakage] (averiar [to break]): ‘loss or damage’
contusión [bruise/contusion] (contusionar [to bruise]): ‘strike/knock damage’
fractura [fracture] (fracturar [to fracture]: ‘broken bone’
lesión [injury] (lesionar [to injure]): ‘body damage or bodily damage after a blow’
martirio [martyrdom] (martiriar [to martyr]): ‘death, torture, pain, physical
suffering’
tortura [torture] (torturar [to torture]): ‘severe physical pain inflicted on someone’
Finally, some verbs are formed from bases that refer to a physical result, to an entity
created as a result of the entity acting as the cause:
desnivel [gradient/irregularity] (desnivelar [to throw off balance]): ‘difference in
level, height difference’
eclipse [eclipse] (eclipsar [to eclipse]): ‘occultation of a star, absence, evasion,
disappearance’
incendio [fire] (incendiar [to catch fire]): ‘big fire’
metamorfosis [metamorphosis] (metamorfosear [to metamorphose]): ‘transforÂ�
mation, change’
óxido [rust] (oxidar [to rust]): ‘compound, layer on the surface’
rosa [pink] (sonrosar [to blush]): ‘pink round spot’
We also find verbs in which the sensory-emotional causative meaning is formed
through a metaphorical or metonymic process that has taken place on the base of
derivation. Thus, within the group of verbs that denote a physical change of state in the
base, we have the following lexemes:

ïœ±ïœ²ïœ¶	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
We find a verb that can indicate both physical and moral sensation:
Encalabrinar, from calabrina which, according to the DCECH, means ‘stench of
corpse’, and could have, by extension of meaning, the physical or moral sense of
‘embarrassment, discomfort’.
All the predicates discussed above express an external causation, as understood by
Levin and Rappaport (1995:â•›92–93):
externally caused verbs by their very nature imply the existence of an “external
cause” with immediate control over bringing about the eventuality described
by the verb: an agent, an instrument, a natural force, or a circumstance […].
Some externally caused verbs such as break can be used intransitively without
the expression of an external cause, but, even when no cause is specified, our
knowledge of the world tells us that the eventuality these verbs describe could not
have happened without an external cause. We thus assume that the intransitive
verbs that regularly have transitive causative uses are externally caused, and those
intransitive verbs that do not are internally caused.
The psychological and physical change of state predicates that we have just seen are
characterized for being biactantial predicates with two arguments: one acts as the
external cause (in Levin and Rappaport’s terms) and the other acts as the component
affected by the action and undergoes the physical or psychological change of state.15
The vast majority of verbs expressing a psychological and physical change of state
Â�
present the experiencer or the affected element as an object. Thus, the first argument
corresponds to the subject of the construction and the external cause. This external
cause acting as the syntactic subject can have two semantic functions according to the
traits of the noun phrase:
Semantic features
Semantic Function 1 agent [+human] [+intentional]
Semantic Function 2 cause [+human] [–intentional]
[+animated]
[–animated]
ïœ±ïœµ.â•… In the literature we have consulted regarding psychological verbs, authors recognize, in
general, two syntactic structures for these verbs. Both structures have the same roles, but they
differ in how these semantic roles are syntactically expressed, namely, what is the Â�
argument
position occupied by the experiencer. Thus, we find a structure in which the Â�
experiencer
is the object, either directly or indirectly (with verbs such as preocupar [to worry], asustar
[to frighten] or agradar [to please]), and another in which the experiencer appears in the
syntactic position of subject (with verbs such as temer [to fear]). See, in this regard, Levin
(1993:â•›
189), Filip (2000:â•›
3–7), Varela (2002:â•›
177), Oyharçabal (2003:â•›
10), Yang (1994) and
Demonte (1990:â•›128).
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ²ïœ·
We understand that the agent is the human entity that has the intention to carry out
the action deliberately. It is possible to observe the agentive nature of this entity thanks
to the context, as we see in the following examples:
	 (4)	
La Policía ha detenido en Móstoles a un matrimonio de inmigrantes que
Â�presuntamente torturaba a sus tres hijos, lo que provocó que tuvieran que
ser internados varias veces en centros asistenciales (CREA, El Mundo,

El negro Emiliano atemoriza a los extranjeros en una esquina del centro
de La Habana y una vez espantados les ofrece la asistencia espiritual de-
bida como misionero de San Lázaro y servidor del Papa (CREA, El País,
16/01/1998 [3/7/2010]).
In the first example we see a physical change of state on the object as a result of the
action of an external agentive cause, “the immigrant couple”, who performed the action
intentionally and repeatedly. In the case of atemorizar [to frighten] we see a psycho-
logical change of state in the object brought about by an external cause, “the black man
Emiliano”, who performs the action in a voluntary way (his business consists in scaring
foreigners first and providing them assistance later).
As for the cause argument, we must note that there are several entities that can
operate as a cause. We can have a subject that is a human entity, but without the
Â�
deliberate intention of carrying out the action; most human entities that appear as the
subject of these verbs act as a cause and not as an agent:

El matrimonio regresó a Toronto y a los dos días de aterrizar, el 25 de febrero,
la mujer se sintió enferma. Murió en su casa una semana después, pero sólo
tras haber contagiado a varios familiares. Uno de ellos fue admitido en un
hospital comunitario de Toronto, y allí contagió a varios médicos, enfermeras
y pacientes de ese centro sanitario (CREA, El País. Salud, 13/05/2003:
“El médico como vector de la neumonía asiática” [4/7/2010]).

“Yo me reúno con unos viejitos, primero comemos y de sobremesa, somos

habría pronunciado Moumdjian en el despacho del juez en lo Correccional
Fernando Pigni, quien tenía a su cargo la causa por violación a la Ley de
Juegos (CREA, Clarín, 19/05/1997: “Presunta interferencia en una causa
judicial” [5/7/2010]).
The verb contagiar [to infect/transmit] in the proposed example has a human subject
that has no intention of carrying out the physical change that occurs in the object as
a result of its action, thus acting as a cause. In the case of jorobar [to bother], we see a
ïœ±ïœ¶.â•… When citing examples, we include the date of the search in brackets.
ïœ±ïœ²ïœ¸	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
psychological change of state (‘impertinence, annoyance nuisance’) which the object
suffers after the action of the human subject, which here also serves as a cause for the
action performed in a non-voluntary way.
We can also find cause subjects that correspond to animate entities, but not
human, or to inanimate entities that cause the development of the action, whether
they are circumstances, events, etc. They act, therefore, as a stimulus for performing
the action:

With the verb tormentar [to torment], of psychological change of state, which indicates
the feeling that the object suffers, we can find a cause subject that is animated, but not
human. In the second example, the verb anquilosar [to ankylose] denotes a physical
sensation that the object undergoes as a result of the action undertaken by the subject,
which, in this case, is inanimated (“sedentary lifestyle”). Finally, airar [to enfuriate]
indicates a psychological change of state in which the object experiences a feeling of
anger; here we find an inanimate subject that alludes to a fact or circumstance which
is interpreted as a cause.
The second argument is the object17 of the construction, which may have, in turn,
two semantic functions according to the traits of the phrase:
ïœ±ïœ·.â•… Syntactically, this object is manifested in most cases as a direct object. Some verbs show
it as an indirect object, such as interesar [to interest], but they are rare. We must remember,
in any case, that psychological verbs with a human experiencer are verbs bordering between
transitivity and intransitivity and this fact is evident because the clitic used to replace the
complement may be either in the accusative or the dative.

tamente asfixió a su hijo un día después de nacer y lo abandonó, envuelto en

En mayo de este año, el sondeo electoral publicado por “La Vanguardia”,
revelaba que la falta de higiene en las calles del municipio constituía la primera

ciudadana que, durante años, angustió sobremanera a los vecinos de Badalona
(CREA, La Vanguardia, 30/10/1995: Jaume V. Aroca [1/7/2010]).
In these two examples we have experiencer human objects that are affected by a
Â�
physical change of state, in the case of asfixiar [to asphyxiate], and psychological
change of state, in the case of angustiar [to distress].
Similarly, animate entities can act as experiencers; these animate entities have the
ability to feel or experience that change because of their inherent properties.

Ella platicaba mucho con los animales. Por ejemplo, cuando le pegaba a algún

otra vez (CREA, Burgos, E. (1983): Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me
nació la conciencia, Barcelona, Editorial Seix Barral [4/7/2010]).
In this case, it is the animal, which acts as the object, that experiences the feeling of
affection as a result of the action performed by the subject.
The semantic affected role is relegated to those inanimate entities that operate as
objects and undergo a physical change that has been brought about by the cause or
agent subject:

With acalorar [to heat] we observe a physical change of state in the environment: it
changes to a climate of activity, heat or tension as a result of the action brought about
by the cause that acts as a subject.
It is rare to find affected objects with verbs expressing a psychological change
of state, although it is possible to observe them in those cases where the object is
Â�
metaphorically or metonymically interpreted:

Luego, lo llevó al caballo laboriosamente mientras Julio Aparicio hacía, con
maestría y a la perfección, de convidado de piedra. Pero poco después, ya con
la muleta en la mano, le vino el arrebato y el éxtasis y arrebató y extasió a
la plaza con dos redondos magníficos y un doble pase de pecho; y después, a
meditar en un sosegado paseo por los alrededores del toro (CREA, El Mundo
20/04/1995: “Sevilla. Toros de Alcurrucén. Manzanares, Ortega Cano y Julio
Aparicio” [5/7/2010]).
In this case, for example, we interpret that la plaza [the ring] refers to the crowd at the
bullring that is actually experiencing the ecstasy.
When a mental change of state verb has an inanimated or affected object, it seems
that it is normal to put aside the psychological change of state interpretation and to
interpret it as a physical change of state verb:18

Barcelona, Seix Barral, p. 9 [4/7/2010]).
Encalmar [to calm] means ‘to calm down, tranquilize’; this peace or tranquility can be
experienced by human or animated entities, so the verb would be of the psychological
change of state kind; however, in this case, we see an inanimate object, which causes a
physical change of state interpretation of the verb: the atmosphere now has a sensation
of peace or tranquility.
As for the syntactic-semantic structures of the verbs we are studying, we would also
like to mention the case of a few verbs (codiciar [to covet], necesitar [to need], paladear
[to savour], saborear [to savour]) that are characterized because the experiencer acts as
the subject of the construction, and not as the object, as in previous cases.19 In this case,
ïœ±ïœ¸.â•… Levin (1993:â•›191) says something similar, because when she is speaking of psychological
verbs she indicates that some of the verbs in this class“also are used in a physical action sense;
among them are agitate, depress, hit, strike (e.g. The carpenter depresses the lever)”.
ïœ±ïœ¹.â•… García-Medall (1998) also refers to the verbs that we are treating as change of state
verbs. Within a group of “verbos activo-procesuales actitudinales” he includes verbs that are
Â�
internal to the human subject, either psychological (most frequently), social or physical (less
frequently), which are in between what is strictly active and what is strictly Â�
experimentative.

These are verbs of will and understanding such as agobiar(se) [to (be) overwhelm(ed)],
Â�
ambicionar [to aspire to], ansiar [to long for], azorar(se) [to embarrass/to get embarrassed],
calmar(se) [to calm/to calm down], etc.According to the author, these verbs usually require a
human subject who acts and undergoes an attitude. However, we think that here he is mixing
two structures that we have identified in our study: firstly,those with a human and experiencer
subject, as in the case of ambicionar [to aspire to], and, secondly, those with a cause subject
and an experiencer object, such as agobiar [to overwhelm]. In addition, in a separate group
he includes verbs like asfixiar [to asphyxiate] that would always have, as he says, an Â�
affected
subject, allowing the emergence of reflexivity. However, in the active transitive scheme that
the author proposes,“Juan asfixió la llama con los dedos” [John smothered the flame with his
fingers], we do not believe that the subject is concerned or affected, but is the cause of the
change. We believe that the distinction of what syntactic position the semantic roles occupy
is crucial to understanding how the change of state is produced in these verbs, although we
agree with the author on the grouping together of physical and psychological change of state
that occurs with this type of verbs.

por ejemplo, la radio del coche. Sin embargo -dicen la tauromaquia y sus
apóstoles- a los toros hay que matarlos bien (CREA, El País, 01/10/1989:
“Feria de Otoño” [6/7/2010]).
Codiciar [to covet] is a verb formed on the noun codicia [greed] that expresses a Â�feeling
(‘desire’), thus indicating that the human subject, “Francisco”, experiences a desire or
urge for “fortune”, an element that acts as an object or theme. Necesitar [to need] in
our exemple is a verb expressing psychological change of state; we observe a human
collective subject, “the team”, that experiences the absence of a person, “Stoichkov”,
acting as a theme. If the verb is constructed with another type of object, like, for
example, food “Yo necesito vitaminas/carne/pescado” [I need vitamins/meat/fish], the
subject is interpreted as an experiencer who has a physical sensation. In the case of
paladear [to savour] we note that the human subject “Rodrigo” experiences the ‘taste
or Â�
sensitivity of becoming interested in’ success, the object or theme of the construc-
tion. So, again, we are looking at a psychological change of state. Finally, in the case of
saborear [to savour], the human collective subject, “the fans”, experiences an ‘impres-
sion on the mind’ (psychological change of state) that is produced by the theme of the
construction, “the great bullfighting of Curro Vázquez”. Again, if we change the subject
of Â�
saborear [to savour], we can interpret it as a physical change of state verb: “Ángel
Â�
saboreó el batido de mango” [Angel savoured the mango shake].
With these structures, the causative schema changes with respect to the one
described above. In the previous schema, the agent or the cause which acted as a
Â�
subject caused the change of state in the object. With verbs of this second type,
Â�
however, Â�
causativity is more blurred. Thus, with codiciar [to covet], Francisco experi-
ences greed (‘eagerness or desire’) of good fortune, and it is this element which causes
that feeling. In necesitar [to need], we observe that the subject feels the need or lack
of something as a result of a cause: the need or lack of the object. With paladear [to
savour], the subject experiences a taste for success because the taste for it produces this
sensation in the subject. Finally, the fans feel a sensation of impression because “the
great bullfighting of Curro Vázquez” produces it in them. In these cases, therefore, the
change of state experienced by the subject is not only caused by an external cause, but
the experiencer argument itself is also involved as a cause.
The analysis of the bases that form sensory-emotional denominal causative
verbs  of  external causation has demonstrated the importance that the meaning
of the base has in the formation of denominal verbs. Bases belonging to the same
Â�
semantic field and that have similar characteristics give rise to verbs that can be
Â�
classified together. The importance of the semantics of the base for the meaning of
the resulting verb is also demonstrated in new formations created by speakers. We can
take, as an example, the following verb extracted from the website of El día del español
(http://www.eldiae.es/ficcionario), in which the Cervantes Institute proposed to
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ³ïœ³
Spanish speakers and students the creation of a fictionnary formed by words of their
invention:
Gozamar [to enjoy love]: from gozamor [lovejoy], ‘quintessential pragmatic
sense of physical and psychological love’. Rarely used transitive verb: ‘Joy of love
(to begin to feel the delight of love)’.
This verb is not registered by the Real Academia Española, but it is a spontaneous Â�creation
by a speaker or student of Spanish. Taking into account the meaning of the noun base
forming the verb it is very easy to construct the meaning of the resulting verb, although
the speaker may not have propose it. This is because, as pointed out by Â�
García-Medall
(1998:â•›42), speakers can give a correct sense to a new verb the first time they hear it only
by knowing the possibilities of manipulation of the base noun of Â�
derivation and, if it has
an affix, bearing in mind its meaning too. In this case, the Â�
creator of the verb invents both
the verb and the noun; the noun gozamor [lovejoy] means ‘quintessential pragmatic sense
of physical and psychological love’ and, on this noun that indicates a feeling, it is easy to
interpret that the verb will indicate either ‘to cause lovejoy’ or ‘to experience lovejoy’.
Once we have seen the semantic classification according to the base of sensory-
emotional denominal causative verbs and their syntactic behavior, we turn now to
observe their ability to participate in the causative-inchoative alternation Â�
typical of
change of state verbs.
2.3â•… 
Participation in the causative/inchoative alternation
Prototypical change of state verbs are characterized by their ability to participate in
causative-inchoative alternation. This type of alternation, like middle alternation, is
part of the transitive alternations pointed out by Levin (1993:â•›25) and, specifically, of
those alternations in which “the semantic role of the subject of the intransitive use of
the verb is the same as the semantic role of the object of the transitive use of the verb”.
Levin notes the difficulty in differentiating the middle and the causative-inchoative
alternations and notes that there has been much debate about whether or not they
are one same alternation. What interests us is that B. Levin indicates which verbal
classes can participate in causative-inchoative alternation and, among them, we find
physical change of state verbs and pshychological verbs of the amuse type, in which
the experiencer takes the object position. However, Levin acknowledges (1993:â•›30 and
191) that in English, unlike other languages, few psychological verbs of the amuse type
can participate in causative alternation and that the transitive use with an experiencer
subject receives a middle interpretation. In contrast, in languages like French, Italian
and Russian, these verbs participate in causative-inchoative alternation. To avoid con-
fusion between the different syntactic structures that allow a similar syntactic change,
we will understand causative-inchoative alternation as that in which the object of the
transitive construction corresponds with the subject of the intransitive construction
ïœ±ïœ³ïœ´	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
and, in this change, this phrase maintains its semantic role. The fact that the cause
appears explicitly or implictly in the construction or appears in the background is a
gradation that is not relevant for us to differentiate at this time.
In regard to psychological verbs in Spanish, Varela (2002: Note 177) states that:
Los tipos [de verbos psicológicos] son tres: (a) clase de temer: Experimentante
(sujeto)/Tema (OD) y de uso sólo transitivo […]; (b) clase de agradar, repugnar:
Tema (sujeto)/Experimentante (OI). Los verbos de esta clase no muestran
alternancia […]; (c) clase de preocupar/asustar: Causa/Experimentante. Los
verbos de esta clase alternan entre una construcción transitivo-causativa y otra
intransitivo-incoativa […].
The obvious kind of verbs that alternate are those that express an external causation in
which the subject acts as the cause and the object, expressed as a direct complement, is
the experiencer. Here are some examples of psychological change of state verbs:

In the transitive-causative scheme of abochornar [to embarrass], we note that the
object experiences the moral sensation of bochorno [embarrassment] (‘hot flushes
caused by something that offends, annoys or embarrasses’) due to the action of the
cause “the silence”; on the contrary, in the intransitive-inchoative schema, the sub-
ject “he” experiences the feeling of embarrassment and the cause is blurred, because
its mention is not relevant or it is information that is in the background (“to star in
that overwhelming scene embarrasses the boy”). In the case of alborozar [to cause
joy], if we find the verb in a transitive-causative pattern, the object experiences the
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ³ïœµ
feeling of ‘joy, pleasure’ as a result of the cause “finding a needle in a haystack”; if
the Â�
lexeme appears in an intransitive-inchoative structure, the subject, “the leaders of
communications”, seems to experience that feeling withouth a direct cause that causes
it. Therefore, while in the transitive-causative construction the change of state that
comes from a cause subject does matter, in the intransitive-inchoative what is relevant
is the experimentation process itself that is expressed by the verb. These are two ways
to conceptualize the event: an external cause brings about the process and this process
is achieved in the object, or as a process which reaches the state lexicalized by the verb
internally (Levin & Rappaport 1995:â•›92 and 130).
Let us, now, look at a series of examples of physical change of state verbs that also
alternate:

If atrofiar [to cause atrophy] is inserted into a transitive schema, we understand that a
cause, “enteral feeding”, causes the object, “the pancreas”, to be affected by or experience
ïœ±ïœ³ïœ¶	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
this disease or symptom; if, by contrast, atrofiar appears in an intransitive-inchoative
schema, we understand that the subject “ovaries” experiences that ‘lack of develop-
ment’ as if it were internally happening. The verb lesionar [to injure], which indicates
the result of a physical aggression, may also appear in a transitive-causative structure,
in which an external cause “Goikoechea” causes the object, “Maradona”, to experience
‘bodily harm or detriment’; in the intransitive-inchoative structure the subject “the
referee” internally suffers the injury, without reference to a cause.
As for the temer [to fear] type, in which the experiencer is the subject and the
object acts as a theme, we observe that verbs such as codiciar [to covet], necesitar
[to need], paladear [to savour] and saborear [to savour] can not participate in the
alternation:
	(29)	
Ha llegado el segundo: un plato de papas fritas, con una buena porción de
ketchup para untar. Nick se saborea y hace bromas por el número de pregun-
tas: “Podríamos escribir un libro”, sugiere. “No, mejor le cobro por respuesta”,
corrige (CREA, Revista Hoy, 17–23/11/1997: “Nick Bollettieri” [6/7/2010]).
The basics of the change from the causative construction to the inchoative construction
is that the object of the transitive has the same semantic role as the subject of the intran-
sitive, and that the meaning of the construction also changes (from a subject that causes
a change of state on an object, to a subject undergoing a process internally, without an
explicit cause). In saborear [to savour] this change in semantic roles does not occur: if
we rebuild the possible transitive sentence Nick saborea las papas fritas [Nick savours
the chips], it is clear that in saborear the subject is the same experiencer element in
transitive and intransitive constructions, so there is no change from the object of the
transitive to the subject of the intransitive. With these verbs that have an experiencer
or affected subject it will be impossible, as S. Varela notes, to go from the transitive-
causative to the intransitive-inchoative contruction, because they always require the
agent or an experiencer of a human nature as a subject, and it remains this way both in
the transitive and in the intransitive constructions. However, with verbs that have the
experiencer as an object, the cause subject disappears in the intransitive, and the subject
that appears in this construction is the element that acted as an object in the transitive
construction.
In short: only verbs externally caused by a cause subject and which show the
Â�
experiencer as an object have the option to switch between a transitive-causative
Â�
construction and an intransitive-inchoative one. In the intransitive construction the
element that acts as the subject is the same that acts as the object in the transitive, so it
mustbeanexperienceroraffectedentitythatcanshowtheexperimentationorÂ�affection
of the physical or psyhological change of state as if it were internally Â�
happening thanks
to its semantic properties. Moreover, as several authors note, the alternation exists
if the verb can be constructed with more than just the agent role; i.e. if the verb is
	 Sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs	 ïœ±ïœ³ïœ·
constructed only with an agent, the alternation is not possible, but if the verb can be
constructed with agent, cause, instrument or circumstance, it can alternate (Kiparsky
1997:â•›497). While the causative construction is characterized by highlighting the cause
that triggers the change of state process that another entity experiences, the inchoative
construction highlights only the experimentation or affects the process that the subject
suffers, without involving external causes.
3.â•… Sensory-emotional causative verbs: Location and possession
In this last section we want to briefly mention the relationship between the Â�
causative
verbs that we have explained here and the concepts of location and possession.
The relationship with location is established because the psychological or physical
change of state that an entity experiences is located in that entity, so that we could say
that location is implicit in these verbs. As Cifuentes (in press) points out, we can locate
objects, material bodies, people, states of consciousness and physical processes in rela-
tion to one base. In the case of sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs in which
the experiencer or affected argument is shown as the object, this entity acts as a base
on which the feeling, sensation or effect conflated in the verb is located:

The feeling of tristeza [sadness] is located in a part of the shepherd’s body – his face –;
so we can understand the paraphrase of amohinar [to sulk] as ‘causar mohína en’ [to
cause sulkiness in]. Similarly, in the second example, the feeling of terror is Â�experienced
ïœ±ïœ³ïœ¸	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
by the civilian population and it is in the civilian population that it is located. In the
third case, the physical sensation of ‘drug addiction’ is located in the object that expe-
riences it, in the person of the speaker. Finally, the result which follows the action
performed by the subject – the “employer or some thug” – is located on the object: a
fire occurs in the factory and only there. As we can see, the base on which the feeling
or sensation is located can be a human or inanimated entity and both serve as a refer-
ence point for location.
On the other hand, when the experiencer or affected acts as the subject of the
construction, this entity is interpreted as the basis of the experience or sensation that
is incorporated into the denominal verb.

In this case, we have a transitive verb in which the experiencer is the subject and it is in
this element where the need or ‘lack of Â�
something’ is located and experienced.
There is also a relationship between sensory-emotional denominal causative verbs
and the possessive content. Possession does not refer only to the fact of possessing
Â�
material entities, but as Langacker (2004:â•›89) notes, “in prototypical instances of posses-
sion, the possessor (R) actively controls the possessed (T) in some manner – physically,
socially, or experientially”. The author makes it clear with the following example:
Likewise, a part usually belongs to just one highest-level whole. I am the only
one who can use my stomach for digestion. I also have the exclusive privilege of
experiencing it (e.g. when it hurts) and controlling its location (when I move, it
goes along with me).
Therefore, as he notes below, “the possessor’s control, when exercized, is not limited to
physical interaction. It extends as well to abstract situations, with social and experiential
factors being if anything more prevalent and important than physical ones” (2004:â•›113).
An attenuation in the degree of agentive control may occur, converting the subject into
a mere experiencer.

El parte facultativo de David Luguillano, dice entre otras cosas que el diestro
recibió “herida en el tercio medio en la cara anterior del muslo izquierdo que
tiene dos trayectorias, una hacia arriba de veinte centímetros de longitud,
causa destrozos en el muslo recto anterior y otra hacia atrás que contusiona

Era la última jornada y Fernando hizo colocarse a los demás y sacó la foto.
Podía haber utilizado un trípode y salir también él en el retrato, pero en
aquellos tiempos la fotografía apasionaba a Fernando hasta el punto de
convertir su propia imagen en tabú para la cámara que manejaba. Tampoco
los cazadores antiguos comían la caza que lograban alcanzar (CREA, El
Mundo, 23/08/1995: J. M. Merino: “Aquel verano del 79” [1/7/2010]).
In these two cases, the possessor entities, “fémur” and “Fernando”, have a physical
Â�
sensation in the first case (“a bruise or contusion”), and a feeling in the second one
Â�(“passion”). It seems clear that Fernando has more control over the experience Â�possessed
than the femur, which is a mere experiencer of the physical state possessed.
The possessive content is explicitly seen when the verb acts as an intransitive.
In this scheme, occasionally the DRAE (2001) defines the verb as ‘tener + sustantivo
incorporado’ [to have + incorporated noun]. This explicit expression of the possessive
content can be observed in many verbs that have transitive and intransitive uses:
acostumbrar [to get used to] (costumbre [habit]):
‘tr. To make a habit of acquiring something’
‘intr. To have a habit of doing something’
calmar [to calm] (calma [calm]):
‘tr. To calm, numb, moderate’
‘intr. To be calm, or tend towards calm’
empavorecer [to terrify] (pavor [terror]):
‘tr. To cause dread, scare someone’
‘intr. ant. To fill with dread, fear, terror or fright’
necesitar [to need] (necesidad [need]):
‘tr. To force something to be carried out’
‘intr. To have a requirement or need of someone or something’
In the following examples we use intransitive verbs of this type:
	(37)	 Acostumbra a ir al cine (DRAE 2001, s. v. acostumbrar).
	(38)	
La ciudad apestaba y nos enterábamos de que, a muy pocos kilómetros, en
La Mudarra, se podía dejar a oscuras a media España. La actitud de los
trabajadores en huelga empezaba a ser impopular en algunos sectores (CREA,
Triunfo, 16/07/1977: “Mañana, todos, con el traje de faena…” [1/7/2010]).

Y Octavia no estaba loca. Pero penaba, porque ya nunca se le presentaría la
oportunidad de estarlo (CREA, La Nueva Provincia, 15/12/1997: “Derrotó a
Colón por 2 a 1…” [6/7/2010]).
With these verbs the subject is the possessor of the habit, of the stink and of the grief or
affliction. As we see, rather than an individual who controls the possession, we observe
ïœ±ïœ´ïœ°	 Ruth Lavale Ortiz
an attenuated possession manifested as an experimentation. Possession in these cases
is more abstract than the typical cases of material possession as in “Richard has two
houses/a car”.
The relationship, therefore, between sensory-emotional denominal causative
verbs and the concepts of location and possession could be summed up understanding
that the possessed (physical or psychological sensation, feeling, etc. that is conflated in
the verb) is located in the possessor (experiencer or affected element) or location base.
4.â•… Conclusions
In this article we wanted to show the behavior of denominal causative verbs that we
have called sensory-emotional verbs. This label includes, in addition to those known
as psychological or emotional verbs, other verbs that indicate a physical change of state
and that possess a syntactic-semantic structure similar to psychological verbs. What
is relevant is that these verbs express a physical or psychological change of state that
is instigated or provoked by a cause, meaning we can interpret their content via the
cause + incorporated noun paraphrase. These verbs expressing external causation can
express their experiencer or argument affected by the change of state as a direct object
or as a subject, but while the former can alternate with an intransitive-inchoative con-
struction, the latter do not allow this alternation. The noun bases conflated in these
denominal verbs belong to very specific areas and the knowledge of their meaning is
decisive in establishing the meaning of the resulting denominal verb.
We have also found that along with the causative content, sensory-emotional
denominal causative verbs also express a locative and a possessive meaning. Thus, the
entity that acts as an experiencer or entity affected by the change is, at the same time,
the base location that has the feeling, emotion, sensation, result, etc. conflated into the
verb and updated with the causative action.

Morphology and pragmatics of affixal negation
Evidence from Spanish des-*
Susana Rodríguez Rosique
University of Alicante
This chapter deals with the difference between propositional negation and
the affixal negation which is conveyed by the Spanish prefix des-. To do so,
verbal prefixation is chosen, since it better represents the way in which the
two kinds of negation directly compete with each other regarding the verbal
event. The markedness – or stronger sense – of affixal negation as opposed to
propositional negation is then explained in terms of the way in which a pragmatic
strengthening principle (following Horn 1984) interacts with the verbal features
of the corresponding bases. The result of this interaction may be specified in
different ways. More generally, this article reflects the importance of Pragmatics
in word formation processes.
Keywords:â•‡ propositional negation; affixal negation; pragmatic strengthening;
verbal prefixation
1.â•… Introduction
Among Spanish word formation processes, those associated to the prefix des- are
enormously productive. As is argued by numerous works on morphology, it may be
explained both because of the diversity of bases to which it can be adhered (nouns,
verbs, adjectives) and because of the heterogeneity of the resultant categories; it
Â�
contributes to the formation of nouns from nouns, adjectives from adjectives and,
especially, verbs from verbs, nouns or adjectives.
This productivity is also accompanied by a great variety of meanings; in fact,
Â�
des- may express separation (desterrar [to banish]), privation (deshuesar [to bone],
deshonesto [dishonest], deshonor [dishonour]), reversion (deshacer [to undo]) or

Â�negation (desagradar [to dislike]). Most of these meanings are integrated in the set
of values of opposition already established by Aristotle; however, the formations to
which des- is adhered usually involve subjective senses, which can be analyzed as a
result of the process of incorporating negation. Obviously, this phenomenon does not
only belong to Spanish. Since Jespersen (1917), it is assumed that the English unwise
does not mean just ‘not wise’, but something like foolish; similarly, unhappy is not only
‘not happy’, but it is interpreted as miserable. This tendency has been deeply analyzed
in the case of adjectives, which develop a depreciatory sense when they are preceded
by Â�
negative prefixes. The process also extends to several languages, like German or
French, among others (cf. Zimmer 1964; Horn [1989] 2001; Horn 2002). In Spanish,
subjective senses may be triggered both by the prefix in- and by the prefix des- (cf.
Gyurko 1971; Brea 1994; Martín García 1995; Costa 2008). In the case of the latter,
as is pointed out by several linguists, it seems unquestionable that, for instance, the
Â�adjective desleal cannot be defined just as ‘lacking loyalty’, but is surrounded by a
Â�pejorative sense; similarly, the noun desventaja does not convey just ‘the lack of advan-
tage’, but a true situation of inferiority (Brea 1994:â•›112).
The aim of this article is to analyze to what extent the special, subjective values
of des- can be explained through the interaction between a pragmatic strengthening
Â�
principle (cf. Horn [1984] 1998) and the verbal peculiarities of the bases to which
the prefix is joined. Specifically, this proposal deals with the formation of verbs
and, Â�
especially, with the formation of verbs from verbal bases; thus, it differs from
the Â�
aforementioned works, which have mainly focused on the subjective values of
Â�
adjectives. The reason why verbal prefixation is preferred is due to the fact that it
represents a suitable scenario to study how morphological negation competes with
propositional negation concerning verbal events. It also allows us to determine if the
difference between them and the special character presented by the former may be
understood in terms of some more or less conventionalized pragmatic processes.
2.â•… 
Some general aspects of negative meaning
2.1â•… 
Aristotelian relations of opposition
Des- may invoke several meanings related to the Aristotelian general concept of
Â�
opposition. In fact, in the Categorías (1999:â•›128–136) Aristotle delimits four types of
relation concerning opposition:
	 (a)	Contrariety: It is established between contrary terms (bueno/malo [good/bad]).
	 (b)	
Contradiction: It is established between contradictory terms (par/impar
[even/odd]) or propositions (X está sentado/X no está sentado [X sits/X does
not sit]).
	 Morphology and pragmatics of affixal negation	 ïœ±ïœ´ïœ·
	 (c)	
Correlation: It is established between terms which are contiguous (doble/
mitad [double/half]).
	 (d)	
Privation: It is established between possession and the lack of an entity or
Â�property (vista/ceguera [sight/blindness]).
The distinction between contraries and contradictories is mainly explained by the
Â�
existence of an area in between two contrary terms; by contrast, contradictory terms
entirely exhaust their domains, and they consequently exclude any possibility for
Â�middle terms. There is no middle term between par and impar [odd and even], so if one
of them is true, the other one is ruled out; and, conversely, if one of them is Â�
considered
false, the other one is automatically assumed to be true. Thus, the contradictory terms
par and impar cannot be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false; that is, if
a number is not par, then it is impar, and if a number is impar, then it cannot be par.
Contrary terms, however, do have a middle area, so they cannot be simultaneously true,
but they can be simultaneously false: something may be neither bueno nor malo. In the
case of correlation, this is an interdependent, symmetrical kind of opposition: X may be
doble [the double] of Y if and only if Y is mitad [half] of X. Finally, in the Aristotelian
sense, privation is defined as the lack of a default property.
The categories delimited by logicians have been used by linguists for different
Â�
purposes. For instance, the difference between contraries and contradictories has
proven to be a useful tool to classify the relationships of opposition generated in the
lexicon, which seems especially profitable in the case of adjectives. Thus, the kind of
opposition has been linked with the (im)possibility of gradation of the adjectives; i.e.
we can be very happy, but not a bit dead (cf. Cruse 1976; Lyons 1977; Horn 2002; Costa
2008). The relationship between possession and privation has also been Â�
fundamental
concerning the marked character of the latter. Privation denotes the lack of a default
property, so it is much more psychological and cognitively complex than its positive
counterpart, in the sense that it always presupposes it. The same asymmetry may
extend to negative proposition with respect to their positive counterparts (Givón 1978;
Horn [1989] 2001:â•›154–203).
2.2â•… 
The ablative component and the polysemy of construction
Among the values conveyed by des-, it seems obvious that the original meaning – or,
at least, the most simple because of its physical character – is the ablative sense. The
Â�
originality of this sense is supported from a diachronic point of view, since it comes
from the Latin prefix dis-, which meant ‘dispersión’ or ‘desunión’ [‘split’], and joined
nouns and adjectives in order to form verbs. In Medieval Spanish, des- extended its
values and at the same time it absorbed the meaning of other Latin prefixes, such
as de-, ex- or ab- (Brea 1976:â•›
323–326; Vañó-Cerdá 1990:â•›
1; Montero Curiel 1999:â•›
115–155; Martín García 2007:â•›6–7; Costa 2008:â•›139–140).
ïœ±ïœ´ïœ¸	 Susana Rodríguez Rosique
The idea that the ablative value is the basic meaning of the prefix des- is especially
useful to explain, in a unified way, verbalization through parasynthesis; that is, those
cases of verbalization in which a prefix and a suffix are simultaneously applied to con-
form verbs from adjectives or preferably from nouns (Serrano-Dolader 1995:â•›134–143,
1999:â•›4719–4724; Martín García 2007:â•›14–17). Thus, the meaning of ‘movement from a
source’ is obvious in verbs conveying separation, like desterrar [to banish], which may
be paraphrased by ‘move something/somebody away from earth’. Similarly, at the same
time that the movement from a source is conveyed, the instrument triggering that
movement or the result caused by it may also be expressed; as occurs in despinzar [to
pick off the knots, the hair or straw from clothes] or destrozar [to smash], Â�respectively.1
Furthermore, the ablative component may also be connected with one of the most
productive values in deadjectival and denominal verbs formation through the prefix
des-; i.e. the privative meaning. In fact, to move something away from an origin also
implies to deprive a base of a certain figure. For instance, despiojar [to delouse] may
be understood as ‘to move lice away from X’, but also as ‘to deprive X of lice’. Location
and possession are cognitively linked concepts in Langacker’s (2004) terms: if Y is in X,
it can be said that X owns Y. It is not surprising then that, when a figure is not located
in a base anymore, the base lacks that figure. It has been argued that there is even a
cognitive connection between location, possession and attribution, and that there is
typological evidence supporting this hypothesis (cf. Cifuentes forthcoming). We can
go further and assume that the same connection may hold in the opposite direction,
which allows us to establish a link between movement from a source, privation and
some other notional values related to negation.
The ablative character of des- allows the notion of movement to be Â�
contemplated
from different angles, and at the same time it is conceptually linked to the Â�
privative
meaning. But, furthermore, its deictic meaning – which conveys movement and
focuses on the source – may be projected upon several abstract levels (Battaner
1996:â•›321–322). When it works on the space level, des- presents the aforementioned
physical values, related to some extent to movement. However, it may also apply to
time or some other more abstract levels like aspect.2 The ablative component – or
egressive value, in terms of Battaner – results thus in a sort of productive schematic
ïœ±.â•… The sense of movement from a source may also be orientated from top to bottom (despeñar
[to throw over a cliff]), or it may have some other effects; i.e. it may denote a strong blow.
To some extent, these senses are determined by the configuration of the base (Vañó-Cerdá
1990:â•›
9–18; Serrano-Dolader 1995:â•›
134–143, 1999:â•›
4719–4724, and in this volume; Martín
García 2007:â•›14–17).
ïœ².â•… Thus certain temporal elements, like ya or dejar de, acquire a great importance in the
Â�
definitions that dictionaries provide of derived verbs with des- (Battaner 1996:â•›
326–327,
Â�
352–353). For instance, the verb desadorar may be defined as ‘to stop adoring’, but also as ‘not
to adore anymore’ (Vañó-Cerdá 1990:â•›4).
	 Morphology and pragmatics of affixal negation	 ïœ±ïœ´ïœ¹
image projectable on different levels, from the most simple or physical to the most
abstract.3
The explanatory power of the ablative character contained in the original meaning
of the prefix des- is supported by diachronic reasons, as pointed out above. The impor-
tance of the meaning of separation in negative prefixation has not gone unnoticed, to
the extent that it has been considered almost a semantic primitive; that is, a feature that
is shared by any negative prefix regardless of its etymological origin. This is Lieber’s
(2004:â•›108–125) claim, to whom in terms of lexical semantics the common feature of
any negative prefix is [-loc]. In Lieber’s view, contrary to prepositions, that may Â�
trigger
polysemy through sense connection, negative prefixes have a more abstract value,
only perceptible through the component [-loc]. From this perspective, any other value
attributed to these prefixes is determined by the peculiarity of the base, so Â�
negative
prefixation favours the polysemy of construction.
Whereas the importance of the ablative component in the case of des- is undoubted,
anddespitethefactthatthepeculiaritiesofthebasesdetermineinsomewaytheÂ�meaning
and the productivity of the prefix (see Serrano-Dolader in this Â�
volume), reducing the
meaning of all negative prefixes to the component [-loc] may result in an excessively
abstract description, which may overlook some recurrent tendencies that are important
for the analysis of how negative prefixes work.4 In the cases of Â�
deverbal verbs – i.e.
Â�
verbal prefixation, on which this article is focused –, besides the ablative component
and the configuration of the base, some other aspects may have been taken into account;
i.e. those related to a pragmatic principle with a certain degree of Â�
conventionalization.
These values involve a strengthening of negation and, more generally, they are due to
the tendency to seek a more specific interpretation.

Meeting affixal negation: The prefix des- in the formation
of deverbal verbs
The formation of verbs trough parasynthetic processes involving des- is in some way
related to the image of ‘movement from a source’, which is contemplated from different
ïœ³.â•… Costa also considers the egressive character of the prefix des- as a kind of macro-field in
which some other values of des- can be included, depending on whether it denotes a literal
or figurative movement; i.e. a movement from a source, the abandonment of a state, or a
Â�
movement from one state to another one (2008:â•›263–264).
ïœ´.â•… Thus Horn (2002) has demonstrated that the value of privation, in the Aristotelian sense,
may explain some uses of the English prefix un- when it joins different categories: non grad-
able adjectives, denoting the lack of a default property (undead to refer ‘zombies’), and nouns
which are not part of a certain category, but share with it a functional similarity (uncola,
unmartini), or those representing a non prototypical member of a certain category (unbreak-
fast). The same concept can also be linked with reversative verbs, as will be shown below.
ïœ±ïœµïœ°	 Susana Rodríguez Rosique
perspectives. However, it is harder to determine the different values of the prefix when
it is applied to form verbs from verbal bases. There is no agreement as to the isolation
of the different meanings, which are even believed to overlap (R.A.E. 2009:â•›721). It is
frequent to distinguish the following meanings for the prefix des- when it is adhered
to verbal bases (Vañó-Cerdá 1990:â•›18–25; Brea 1994:â•›115–118; Varela & Martín García
1999:â•›5019–5023; Martín García 2007:â•›10–14; Martín García & Varela 2009:â•›75–76):
â•ﬁ
– Negative meaning: It arises when the prefix joins verbs denoting states or
Â�
activities without an explicit beginning or end. The resultant verbs may be
paraphrased as ‘not + base’ or ‘stop + base’. Some examples are desconocer
[not to know] or Â�
desamar [to stop loving].
â•ﬁ
– Reversative meaning: It arises when the prefix joins verbs expressing telic
events, like deshacer [to undo]. These verbs denote a contrary action to that
described by the verb base.
â•ﬁ
– Intensive meaning: It arises when the prefix presents evaluative meanings, as
occurs in desinformar [to misinform] or desinquietar [to disquiet].
Nevertheless, as has been pointed out above, there is not a unanimous opinion regard-
ing the classification of the different meanings conveyed by des- when it joins verbal
bases. For instance, the R.A.E. divides the negative meaning in those verbs expressing
‘absence of a property’, like desconocer, from those expressing ‘stop or interruption’, like
desamar. Similarly, it acknowledges that the latter may be overlapped with reversative
verbs on some occasions; i.e. a verb like desocupar may be understood as ‘stop occupy-
ing’ but also as ‘to carry out the contrary action to occupying’ (R.A.E. 2009:â•›721–722).
There also seems to be controversy over the delimitation of the intensive meaning
attributed to des- (see Serrano-Dolader in this volume), since some linguists sepa-
rate those cases in which the prefix evaluates the verbal event, like desinformar, from
those that are merely intensive, like desinquietar, which have sometimes been labelled
as expletive or superfluous (Vañó-Cerdá 1990:â•›24–25), and have been relegated to the
exception due to their scarce productivity.
These overlaps have brought about a reduction in the meanings of des- in verbal
prefixation and the establishment of just two values for the prefix when it joins verbal
bases: i.e. the negative value and the reversative value, which are also the most produc-
tive meanings in present-day Spanish.5 The majority of these overlaps are precisely
due to the action of pragmatic principles with a certain degree of conventionalization,
ïœµ.â•… Something similar happens with the English prefix un-, although in this case it is due
to diachronic reasons. Etymologically, the negative prefix un- which is applied to nominal
and especially adjectival bases is different from the prefix un- which is applied to verbs and
develops a reversative meaning. However, in spite of their different origins, it seems that their
respective meanings are psychologically related (cf. Horn 2002).

which at the same time contributes to defining the marked or special character of
affixal negation as opposed to propositional negation.
3.1â•… 
A classic revisited: The reversative meaning
Since Marchand ([1972] 1974), it is assumed that some negative prefixes denote a con-
trary action to that expressed by their verb bases when they join telic events which
imply a state change. This phenomenon extends to several languages and triggers
one of the most productive meanings of the prefix des- in creating verbs from verbal
bases (hacer [to do]> deshacer [to undo], calzar [to put on shoes] > descalzar [to take
off shoes], colgar [to hang]> descolgar [to unhang]) (Brea 1994:â•›116–118; Varela and
Martín García 1999:â•›5028–5029; Martín García 2007:â•›11–13; Martín García & Varela
2009:â•›76). In the case of Spanish, the need for a telic event to result in a state change
has also been outlined (Martín García 2007:â•›11; R.A.E. 2009:â•›722–723). Nevertheless,
some studies have marked a difference between those reversative verbs that imply a
previous action (descalzar [to take off shoes], descabalgar [to dismount]), and those
– i.e. inversive verbs – which do not necessarily require the action denoted by the base
to have been carried out (desajustar [to unfit]) (Costa 2008:â•›264–270).
Indeed,inHorn’sview(2002:â•›12–26),insteadofemphasisingtheactionexpressed
by the base, it is important to focus on the result, since the resultant state con-
veyed by the derived verb represents the natural, primitive, less marked state of the
theme or patient. This leads the author to the following conclusion about the prefixÂ�
un- when it joins verbs: if the verb is a positive accomplishment and it is Â�goal-oriented,
then the prefix suggests an entropic reading; however, when the verb base is
Â�
inherently source-oriented, the prefix does not invert the direction of the base and
the resultant state is not a contrary state, but the same one, which is then Â�
intensified.
The same can be said about the Spanish prefix des-: when it joins Â�
positive goal-
oriented verbs (like calzar [to put on shoes]), the prefix inverts both the Â�
direction
of the verb base and the resultant state, which goes back to its origin (descalzar [to
take off shoes]). By contrast, when the base is inherently source-oriented, the prefix
des- intensifies the meaning of the base: inquietar [‘to remove/deprive of stillness’]
may be understood as a verb that is orientated towards its source, so desinquietar
reinforces the meaning of the base. From this perspective, the so-called pleonastic
and scarcely productive values of des- can be explained in the same terms as the most
productive one, the reversative meaning. This is not surprising; the more the prefix
is specialized in negative values, the more likely it is that a reticence in using it to
convey intensive senses may arise.6
ïœ¶.â•… Note that the intensive or pleonastic meaning of des- is not very frequent; however, it
usually arises in terms from dialectal or popular origins, in both European and American
Spanish (Torres Martínez 2006:â•›248). Whereas the intensive value is restricted to popular
ïœ±ïœµïœ²	 Susana Rodríguez Rosique
Horn’s proposal can be condensed in the following quotation:
In thematic terms, the un-verb is always source-oriented, whether (as is normally
the case) the base itself bears a goal reading which the un-version reverses, or
whether the base itself bears a source reading, which the un-verb duplicates or
reinforces.  (2002:â•›20)
The entropic explanation may extend to the reversative meaning of the Spanish Â�
des-,
as Vañó-Cerdá already mentioned, in a way (1990:â•›
25).7 Similarly, this perspective
allows our attention to be drawn to some aspects of the prefix. On the one hand, the
Â�
reversative meaning may be understood in deictic terms; on the other, in most of the
cases the meaning of des- presents a reversative – thus, contrary – reading. Likewise,
the prefix is linked to a certain intensifying or reinforcing character. All these aspects,
belonging to one of the most productive des- meanings, may influence the special
character of the affixal negation, as is shown in the following section.
3.2â•… Affixal negation, strengthened negation
On different occasions it has been argued that verbs derived through des- Â�prefixation
present a negative meaning which can be paraphrased as the negation of the base. This
meaning usually arises when des- joins bases representing states or activities that do not
establish a clear beginning or a limited end (Varela & Martín García 1999:â•›5021; Martín
García 2007:â•›10–11); that is, as opposed to the reversative Â�
meaning, the Â�
negative value
usually appears when the events do not result in state change. This is what happens in
verbs like desagradar [to dislike], desconocer [not to know], desconfiar [to distrust],
desaprovechar [to waste], desobedecer [to disobey], descuidar [to neglect], desaprobar
[to disapprove], desagradecer [to be ungrateful]… However, as is also pointed out, the
negation shown by these verbs seems in some way different from propositional nega-
tion (as the Avoid Synonymy Principle predicts); it is Â�
usually said that prefixed verbs
present a “marked”, “stronger” or “more specific” negation than their propositional
counterparts (Brea 1994:â•›113; Battaner 1996:â•›360; Varela & Martín García 1999:â•›5021;
Martín García 2007:â•›10–11).8 Thus, desagradar is not totally equivalent to ‘no agradar’,
or dialectal ambits, the evaluative meaning frequently emerges in the press or at a less
Â�colloquial level.
ïœ·.â•… “[S]e da cuando la base posee un significado negativo o cuando encierra en sí misma
la idea de alejamiento, división, privación, negación, etc. que aportaba des- en sus distintas
modificaciones” (1990:â•›25).
ïœ¸.â•… Costa establishes the label “negación simple” [mere negation] for des- verbs, and she
Â�
includes within it both “merely negative verbs” (like desacertar [to be wrong], desaprobar
[to disapprove]) and “clearly evaluative verbs” (like desacatar [to disobey], desaconsejarÂ�
[to Â�dissuade], desagradar [to dislike], desobedecer [to disobey]). In Costa’s view, even those
	 Morphology and pragmatics of affixal negation	 ïœ±ïœµïœ³
nor is desagradecer exactly the same as ‘no agradecer’. These marked, subjective mean-
ings that surround affixal negation using des- are in fact the result of a pragmatic prin-
ciple rutinization process leading to a more specific interpretation of the utterance;
this specificity may materialize in different ways, depending on its interaction with the
different kind of verbs.
In Horn’s pragmatic model ([1984] 1998; [1989] 2001:â•›194–203), communication
resides in the equilibrium between Zipf’s two antinomic forces: a unification force,
based on the speaker’s economy – or Principle of Least Effort – and a diversification
force, based on the hearer’s economy – or the need to be understood –. Both Â�
attitude
patterns may be formalized in two conversational principles that regulate commu-
nication and represent a synthesis of gricean conversational maxims; i.e. Principle
of Quantity and Principle of Relation. The Q Principle is based on the hearer, so it
urges the speaker to make his contribution sufficient – that is, to provide all the infor-
mation that he can –. It is a lower-bounding principle and triggers upper-bounding
implicatures. Thus, if the speaker uses a weaker form it is because he is not in the
situation to use the stronger; or, in other words, what is not said, is not the case. By
contrast, the R Principle is based on the speaker, so it urges him to make his contribu-
tion Â�
necessary – that is, not to provide more information than is strictly needed –. It is
an upper-bounding principle and triggers lower-bounding implicatures, since it urges
the hearer to complete the speaker’s utterances until finding the most informative,
specific interpretation.
Both principles interact with negation. For instance, the Q Principle is helpful
to explain our tendency to the upper limitation of negative utterances; so from the
Â�following scale,
John has four sons
John has three sons
John has two sons
we would tend to limit the negative utterance John does not have two sons and
infer that he neither has three nor four. This inference is cancellable, due to its
Â�
conversational nature, as is shown in John does not have two sons, but three (Horn
[1989] 2001:â•›204–267).
Concerning the R Principle, it seems quite useful to explain the cases of “marked”
negation in prefixed verbs with des-. In fact, this principle tends to seek more Â�
specific
readings and allows us to explain several examples of the strengthening of negation.
The R Principle is related to our tendency to turn the negation of something into the
verbs classified as merely negative are not totally exempt from an evaluative component
(2008:â•›260–261).
ïœ±ïœµïœ´	 Susana Rodríguez Rosique
assertion of its contrary (Bosque 1980:â•›
99–101; Horn [1989] 2001:â•›
308–361). This
behavior pattern licenses the existence of Manichaean creeds – in Horn’s terms –, and
it is psychologically justified by our preference for simple contrast. From a linguistic
point of view, the R Principle explains strengthenings like that carried out in the inter-
pretation of litotes. Thus, an utterance like I don’t like soup is interpreted as I positively
dislike soup. The neg-raising is interpreted in similar terms; that is, an utterance like
I don’t think that John is intelligent, which conveys the negation of an epistemic belief,
tends to be interpreted as I think that John is not intelligent. These strengthenings – that
in propositional negation have the status of conversational implicatures – tend to be
rutinized or conventionalized in affixal negation, leading to different effects depending
on the base nature, and that is the reason why we perceive it as a stronger or marked
negation.
The most obvious case of strengthening of negation comes from those bases which
denote states or which admit some kind of gradation; i.e. those that allow a Â�
scalar
interpretation, as occurs in agradar [to like] or confiar [to trust]. These verbs may be
modified by scalar quantifiers like un poco [a bit], mucho [a lot], bastante [quite]… At
the same time, the events that they denote can be placed along different degrees of a
positive scale; and conversely the same happens in the negative polarity scale. In scalar
terms, the prefixed verb differs from propositional negation in the level of intensity in
which the event is experienced, as is shown in the square of opposition (Horn [1989]
2001:â•›208, 2002:â•›2):
Distinction in quality
Contraries
A
(universal)
Distinction in
quantity
E
O
(particular)
I
Contradictories
Subcontraries
While propositional negation is placed in vertex O, affixal negation is placed in
vertex E. This explains that both may be linked through scalar operators, like es más
[even more] or incluso [even] (R.A.E. 2009:â•›
722). These particles specify the level of
informativity conveyed by propositions:
	(1)	
No me agrada Juan; es más, me desagrada. [I don’t like John; in fact, I even
dislike him].
	 Morphology and pragmatics of affixal negation	 ïœ±ïœµïœµ
Similarly, propositional negation and affixal negation fit in the scalar tests designed by
Horn ([1989] 2001:â•›231–252):
	(2)	
No sólo no me agrada Juan, sino que me desagrada. [Not only do I not like
John, but I dislike him].
The strengthening of negation, specified in scalar intensification, may also affect those
verbs defined through the paraphrase ‘dejar + verbal base’, as is the case in desamar
[to love no more], descreer [to disbelieve]or desfavorecer [to disfavour]. Thus, desamar
may be defined as ‘dejar de amar’ [to stop loving], but also as ‘aborrecer, tener aversión’
[to hate or to show aversion] (R.A.E. 2001).9 Both definitions are respectively observed
in the following examples obtained from the CORDE:
	(3)	
Otrosí los enamorados súbito aman y desaman, contienden y son luego
Â�amigos […]. (R.A.E., CORDE, L. de Lucena, Repetición de amores, c. 1495).
[Besides, lovers suddenly love and stop loving, fight and then become
friends].
	(4)	
Y más me admiro cuando veo que este secreto es tan natural que no solamente
cae en los hombres grandes de razón ni entendimiento, pero aun en los niños
de tierna edad, que sin alcanzar juicio de discreción, se aficionan unos a otros
naturalmente; y por el contrario, se desaman y aborrecen sin saber por qué.
(R.A.E., CORDE, Juan de Arce de Otárola, Coloquios de Palatino y Pinciano,
c. 1550]). [And I get more amazed when I see that this secret is so natural
that it not only belongs to full-gown, intelligent men, but also to young
children, who without understanding become naturally interested in each
other; and, on the contrary, they hate and loathe each other ignoring why].
While (3) can be paraphrased as aman y dejan de amarse [they love and stop loving], in
(4) desamar seems to be placed on the same degree as aborrecer [to loathe].
When des- joins events that do not result in a state – so they cannot admit a
Â�
reversative reading –, the strengthening of prefixed negation may also be Â�
specified
ïœ¹.â•… As was advanced above, the relationships between the different types of opposition and
gradation have been especially studied in the case of adjectives, and as a consequence some
differences between several kinds of antonyms (contraries or contradictories) based on
the (non)gradual nature of their bases have been established. This gradation has also been
Â�
interpreted in scalar terms. Thus, in Costa’s analysis – following proposals which date back to
Zimmer (1964) –, it is shown that most of the adjectival bases to which the Spanish des- Â�orÂ�Â�
in- join are considered positive from the point of view of speakers following a certain Â�evaluative
scale; similarly, the resulting prefixed adjectives are considered negative on a certain scale.
Costa also argues that when the adjectives are considered neutral, speakers tend to seek a
context in order to evaluate them, and they are usually evaluated as contextually negative
(2008:â•›235–248).
ïœ±ïœµïœ¶	 Susana Rodríguez Rosique
in some other way. This is what happens in verbs like desobedecer [to disobey] or
Â�
desayudar [not to assist]. In these cases, the more specific reading triggered by the
R  Principle is reflected in the increase of the willingness shown to Â�
carrying out
the event. In other words, the prefixed verb is not exactly equivalent to the verb’s
Â�propositional negation, since the affixed one strengthens the agentive character of the
subject, which Â�
consequently is not merely experiencing the event (Costa 2008:â•›143).
In the following example, obtained from the CREA, the Â�
faithful women do not
merely no obedecen [do not obey], but they seem to display their will to not carry
out the described action, as proven by the fact that desobedecer is coordinated with
intentar [to try], which implies a modal sense insisting on some kind of effort or
difficulty:
	(5)	
Varias fieles desobedecen a la autoridad eclesiástica, intentan escabullirse y
acceder hasta la sangre.(R.A.E., CREA, El Mundo, 28/07/1994). [Several
faithful women disobey the ecclesiastic authority, they try to slip away and
reach the blood].
This increase in the subject’s willingness to do something consequently leads to the
restriction of the contexts in which the verb can be used (R.A.E. 2009:â•›
721). Thus,
the prefixed verb (desobedecer) and the propositional negation (no obedecer) may be
Â�
interchangeable in some contexts, as exemplified in:
	(6)	
Tienen cinco minutos para salir a la calle. Si desobedecen, ordenaré que
Â�
comience el fuego. (R.A.E., CREA, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Donde mejor
canta un pájaro, 1992). [You have five minutes to go out. If you disobey,
I will order them to open fire].
	(7)	
Si no obedecen, ordenaré que comience el fuego. [If you do not obey, I will
order them to open fire].
Both in (6) and (7) there is a human subject, so they perfectly assume the increase
of agentivity triggered by the prefixed verb. However, desobedecer refuses to appear
with non human subjects, something that is completely acceptable with propositional
negation:
	(8)	
El mando no me obedece/# me desobedece. [The control is not obeying/The
control is disobeying].
On some occasions, not only the syntactic-semantic features of the subject are Â�
limited,
but the restrictions may also affect the complements’ characteristics. This is what
Â�
happens in verbs like desoír (Martín García 2007:â•›11; Costa 2008:â•›143). The base (oír) [to
hear] and its propositional negation (no oír) require a subject to experience the Â�
physical
Â�
perception, and admit any kind of complement which can be heard. Furthermore,
they can appear without explicit complements – or with the internal accusative – to
Â�
characterize the Â�
subject in its physical abilities; in these cases they behave as state verbs:
	 Morphology and pragmatics of affixal negation	 ïœ±ïœµïœ·
	(9)	 Juan oye los ladridos de los perros. [John hears the barking of the dogs].
	(10)	
Juan no oye los ladridos de los perros. [John does not hear the barking
of the dogs].
	(11)	 Juan oye (perfectamente). [John hears –perfectly –].
	(12)	 Juan no oye (bien). [John does not hear –well –].
Again, the prefixed verb increases the degree of the subject’s willingness. Note that in
the following examples desoír conveys ‘no querer oír’ [not wanting to hear] or Â�‘ignorar’
[to ignore] rather than ‘no oír’ [not to hear]. Furthermore, in these cases it is not
only the subject’s features that are restricted, but the characteristics of the complement
are also limited; i.e. the complement now has a verbal nature and triggers perlocutive
effects (Martín García 2007:â•›11); i.e. the requests in (13), the opinion in (14), the files
in (15) or the orders in (16):
	(13)	
El facultativo desoyó los ruegos del enfermo, que no podía soportar el dolor y
la opresión en su pierna. (R.A.E., CREA, La Vanguardia, 16/12/1995). [The
doctor ignored the requests of the patient, who couldn’t bear the pain and
oppression in his leg].
	(14)	
La Quinta Sala de la Corte de Apelaciones desoyó el criterio del magistrado y
otorgó el beneficio a la joven. (R.A.E., CREA, La Tercera, Chile, 26/11/2004).
[The Fifth Room of the Court of Appeals ignored the opinion of the judge
and gave the benefit to the young lady].
	(15)	
El gobierno desoyó informes sobre planes terroristas como el de la embajada
de Japón. (R.A.E., CREA, Proceso, México, 22/12/1996). [The government
ignored the files on terrorist attacks such as the one in Japan’s embassy].
	(16)	
Páez desoyó órdenes y emprendió regreso a Madrid. (R.A.E., CREA, El País,
01/08/1980). [Páez ignored orders and he began his return to Madrid].
In the examples in which the subject is not explicitly human, its human character may
be inferred through metonymy, as occurs in (14) and (15), which refer to Quinta Sala’s
judges and Government representatives, respectively.
The restriction of the nature of the arguments carried out by desoír also limits the
contexts in which the verb can appear with respect both to its simple base and to its
propositional negation counterpart. Specifically, desoír does not admit physical percep-
tion complements – as is observed in (17) –, and it does not frequently appear without
complementation (Costa 2008:â•›143). Furthermore, when the verb is not accompanied
by complements, it does not denote the subject’s physical abilities – as is shown by the
anomaly in (18) –, but it intellectually characterizes the subject, describing the way in
which it behaves or its attitude, as reflected in (19):
	(17)	
#Juan desoye los ladridos de los perros. [John ignores the barking
of the dogs].
	(18)	 #Juan desoye (bien). [John ignores –well –].

Jornada, nº 73, 05/2003, México). [Why do official authorities not obey that
minority who ignore and depreciate?].
In these cases the strengthening of negation is not only linked to an increase in the
Â�
intensity conveyed by the event, but it is also related to a restriction in the features
required by the Â�
predicate. In the same direction, some authors have pointed out that

1990:â•›23; Battaner 1996:â•›361–365).
On other occasions the strengthening of negation lies in its scope, in the sense
that the prefixed verb incorporates the neg-raising. This is what happens in verbs like
desaconsejar[todissuade].Thisverbisnotparaphrasedas‘noaconsejar’[nottoadvise],
but rather as ‘aconsejar que no’ [to advise not to]; in fact, the R.A.E. (2001) defines it
as ‘disuadir, persuadir a alguien de lo contrario a lo que tiene meditado o resuelto’ [to
Â�
dissuade, to persuade somebody to do the contrary to what he had intended].10 More
specifically, (20) does not just mean that Swiss bankers do not advise dictators to open
bank accounts in Switzerland, but that they advise them not to do it, or, in other words,
that they dissuade them from doing so:
	(20)	
Los banqueros suizos desaconsejan a los dictadores abrir cuentas en Suiza.
(R.A.E., CREA, ABC, 17/12/2004). [The Swiss bankers dissuade dictators
to open bank accounts in Switzerland].
And the same can be said about (21), which will be better paraphrased by (22) than
by (23):
	(21)	
[…] los propios institutos nacionales de sanidad, claramente, desaconsejan
ir hablando de grupos de riesgo. (R.A.E., CREA, TVE 1, Debate: El SIDA,

about risk groups].

ïœ±ïœ°.â•… In relation to this, Horn linked the alternation between verbs including an Â�
incorporated
negation and their propositional negation counterparts with the activated status of the
Â�
embedded proposition; that is, with the fact that the subordinate clause is present in the
Â�
preceding discourse (1978:â•›
146–147). As Schwenter has later argued (2006:â•›
341), Â�
although
Horn’s analysis needs to be revised, it shows the non insignificant importance of the
Â�
discourse-pragmatic aspects in some questions related to negation, such as the Jespersen’s
cycle phenomenon (Dahl 1979).

The marked status of affixal negation as the consequence of our tendency to seek a
more specific interpretation may also come from the social or “institutional” dimension
acquiredbythenegationoftheverbalbase,sinceinsomeway itgoesagainstalaw, norm,
duty or assumed social expectation (Battaner 1996:â•›334–342). This is reflected in verbs
like desacatar [to disobey], descuidar [to neglect], desatender [to neglect], deservir [not
to perform one’s duty]… In these cases, the non-fulfilment of the base is contemplated
as a fault against what is socially accepted; it expresses that the Â�
established minimum
is not accomplished, so the marked character of negation results in an approximative
value. The R.A.E. (2001) defines desacatar as ‘no acatar una norma, ley, orden, etc.’
[not to obey a norm, law, order, etc.], but also as ‘faltar a la reverencia o respeto que se
debe a alguien’ [not to be as respectful to somebody as expected]. Similarly, descuidar
is defined as ‘no cuidar de las personas o de las cosas, o no atenderlas con la diligencia
debida’ [not to take care of people or not to take care of them as expected]. As shown
in (24), it seems that descuidar in this example does not just mean ‘not to take care’, but
not to do it as expected:
	(24)	
Los líderes políticos descuidan su salud durante las campañas. (R.A.E.,
CREA, El País, 02/06/1986). [Political leaders neglect their health
during campaigns].
And the same can be said about (25), where descuidar la cosmética [to neglect
Â�
cosmetics] denotes a minimum level that is not reached, as shown by the fact that
it is combined with vestir con desidia [to dress unwillingly] or andar como atletas [to
walk like athletes]. All these aspects exemplify different ways in which the socially
Â�
established minimums for women – from the perspective of a rather sexist speaker –
are not reached; i.e. beauty, elegance and grace:
	(25)	
algunas mujeres hablan de temas antes exclusivamente masculinos y con un
lenguaje aún si cabe más atrevido; descuidan su cosmética, visten con desidia
y andan como atletas olímpicos […]. (R.A.E., CREA, El Norte de Castilla,
30/03/2001). [Some women talk about topics which were previously
Â�
exclusive to men, and they do so in an even more aggressive style; they
neglect cosmetics, dress unwillingly and walk like Olympic athletes].
Thus affixal negation presents some special features which justify its status as a marked
negation. All these aspects consequently arise from a general tendency – originally
adopting the form of a pragmatic principle – that consists in the search for a more
specific interpretation of the utterances. In the case of prefixed negation, this tendency
is specified in its strengthening through the following mechanisms:
ïœ±ïœ¶ïœ°	 Susana Rodríguez Rosique
â•ﬁ
– The intensification of the event degree along a scale; i.e. increasing its
Â�informational force.
â•ﬁ
– The restriction of the features presented by the participants in the event,
which triggers the limitation of the contexts in which the prefixed verb can
be used.
â•ﬁ
– The restriction of the scope through the neg-raising incorporation.
â•ﬁ
– The projection of negation upon a social field, which results in an approxima-
tive value.
In all these cases the strengthening of negation concerns several aspects of the event
itself; even in the last one, in which the aforementioned social dimension results in the
approximative character – it can be said that the strengthening rebounds on the event –.
The last value that exemplifies the search for a more specific interpretation
and that distinguishes affixal negation from propositional negation is the evalu-
ative Â�
meaning. In this case the strengthening does not lie in the event itself, but in
the way in which the speaker contemplates it. These verbs are also strengthened along
a scale that is not related to the intensity with which the event is experienced, but
is an Â�
evaluative scale established by the speaker in terms of lo bueno/lo malo [good/
bad] or lo Â�
conveniente/lo inconveniente [convenient/inconvenient].11 Since the prefix
des- is negatively Â�
orientated, the evaluative character is usually negative or even depre-
ciatory. This is reflected in (26), where if informar [to inform] and desinformar [to
misinform] Â�
constituted opposed terms, the utterance interpretation would result in a
Â�
contradiction, since they happen simultaneously:
	(26)	
[…] sobre todo la TV., al tiempo de informar, desinforma […](R.A.E., CREA,
Los Tiempos, Bolivia, 31/03/1997). [Especially TV, which informs and
Â�
misinforms at the same time].
However, it seems that desinformar is one of the possible forms that informar may
adopt; that is, desinformar represents a particular way of informar, a way of Â�
providing
information. The value conveyed by verbs like desinformar is described by Â�Vañó-Cerdá
as a kind of adverbial modification of the way in which the event is carried out
(1990:â•›21–22).
4.â•… Conclusion
In sum, affixal negation exhibited by the Spanish prefix des- differs from proposi-
tional negation in its marked status. It is a more specific negation which, at the same
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… This scale is similar to the one proposed by Costa for adjectives (2008:â•›319). She points
out the existence of a pragmatic-based norm of comparison.
	 Morphology and pragmatics of affixal negation	 ïœ±ïœ¶ïœ±
time, is interpreted by speakers as stronger, due to the fact that it reflects several
processes of a pragmatic principle rutinization. Some of the cases which have been
Â�
considered exceptions from a morphological point of view may be unitarily explained
by the Â�
conventionalization of a strengthening originally triggered by a conversational
Â�
principle. Pragmatics concerns language in use, so it pays attention to speakers’ inten-
tions and context. From this perspective, morphological studies have analyzed both
the way in which word formation conveys contextual information and the discursive
or argumentative potential of expressive morphology (cf. Dressler & Barbaresi 1994;
Kiefer 1998; and Mellado Prado & Camus Bergareche 2009, for Spanish). Beyond
the traditional division of linguistic levels, nowadays it seems unanimously assumed
that Pragmatics interacts with Semantics and Syntax, and it grows harder and harder
to analyze them separately (Horn 2002). This difficulty does not only belong to the
field of construction, but also to the territory of word. Prefixed verbs with the Spanish
des- are a good example in which Syntax, Semantics and Pragmatics coexist under the
protection of negation.

Formal Processes
Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura*
Josefa Martín García
University Autónoma de Madrid
This chapter focuses on the syntactic and semantic properties of Modern
Spanish deverbal nouns ending in -dura. It specifically focuses on the original
verb features which are preserved by these nouns, since most of them are
apparently lexicalized. The nouns ending in -dura are analyzed within the
framework of deverbal noun formation processes in Spanish in order to better
understand their productivity, the co-existence of cognates in Modern Spanish,
as well as their replacement by another noun formation process.
Keywords:â•‡ deverbal nouns; nominalization; suffixes; productivity
1.â•… Introduction
In Spanish, there are many deverbal nouns ending in -dura, although a lot of them
are no longer in use in modern Spanish (for example, esculpidura [engraving],
Â�
formadura [figure], ladradura [bark]). This fact has lead some authors to question the
Â�productivity of this suffix in modern Spanish. Indeed, within the formation of Â�deverbal
nouns denoting action, the suffix -dura is less productive than the suffixes -miento
(planteamiento [posing], florecimiento [flowering]) or -ción (decoración [decoration],
alegación [declaration]), and various nouns ending in -dura have been replaced by
other deverbal nouns built on the same base but with a different suffix (ablandadura/
ablandamiento [softening]; lavadura/lavado [wash]; enjuagadura/enjuague [swill]). In
other cases, the deverbal noun ending in -dura coexists with another deverbal noun
built on the same base, with both lexical units having different meanings: rozadura =
“injury of the skin”, rozamiento = “action of rozar [to graze]”.

morfológica: las nominalizaciones deverbales” (FFI2008–00603/FILO), financed by the

ïœ±ïœ¶ïœ¶	 Josefa Martín García
The suffix -dura has provided Spanish with a great number of deverbal nouns.
Its productivity has gradually decreased over the centuries to be replaced by other
deverbal noun formation processes (Pena 1980). Nevertheless, there is currently a
considerable number of deverbal nouns ending in -dura. Furthermore, this suffix still
conserves some productivity in colloquial Spanish (tomadura de pelo [pulling of the
leg], comedura de coco [mind-blogging]) and in Latin-American Spanish (cebadura
[action of cebar [to fatten]], chingadura [failure], lastimadura [injury]) (Kany 1960).
In this paper, our aim is to analyze deverbal nouns ending in -dura in modern
Â�
Spanish, bearing in mind their syntactic and semantic properties. More specifically, we
aim to study which of the characteristics of the original verb are preserved by the noun
ending in -dura, since, as we will see, many of them appear to be lexicalized. We are also
interested in studying nouns ending in -dura within the process of deverbal noun forma-
tion in Spanish in order to better understand their productivity, the cognates existing in
modern Spanish, as well as the substitution of some nouns ending in -dura. With these
objectives in mind, we have divided this paper in three sections. In the first section we
are going to discuss the suffix -dura, taking into account its morphological, syntactic
and semantic properties. In the second part, we will focus on nominalizations ending
in-dura,distinguishingdifferenttypesandanalysingtheconstraintsoftheÂ�morphological
process in question. In the last section, we have gathered some final thoughts on the
Â�
formation of nouns ending in -dura in relation to other nominalizations in Spanish.
2.â•… 
The suffix -dura
Etymologically, the suffix -dura is the result of the evolution of the suffix -tūra, which
in Latin would form nouns of actions, some of which have been passed on to Spanish
as patrimonial words: armatūra > armadura [armour], aptatūra > atadura [tie] (Pena
1980; Pharies 2002). Some of these nouns in modern Spanish present a transparent
form and preserve their compositional meaning, since it is possible to distinguish the
verb base upon which the morphological process operates (ligar/ligadura [to tie/tie]).
Nevertheless, we also find nouns with a compositional meaning but with an opaque
form, where the Latin form is preserved for the noun, and the patrimonial form for
the verb (apertura/abrir [opening/to open]). In other cases, although the verb and the
noun exist in Spanish, it is not possible to establish a semantic link between the two
forms (estar/estatura [to be/height]).
From a morphological point of view, we must point out that the suffix -dura
Â�
presents two allomorphs (Martínez Celdrán 1973): -dura, which is added to the Â�
verbal
stem with a theme vowel (quema-dura [burn], escoce-dura [irritation], Â�
añadi-dura
[addition]), and -ura, which appears with verbal stems ending in dental consonant
(apret-ura [squeeze], mont-ura [saddle], junt-ura [joint]). Only the first of the two
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ¶ïœ·
Â�allomorphsisproductive,asshownbythenumberofexistingformations. Â�Nevertheless,
some authors such as Kester (1991), only consider the existence of -ura as a single
morphological form.1 In this sense, the variation in the resulting forms is due to the
base that the morphological process operates on. According to this author, -ura can
be added either to the form of the past participle (quemado > quemad-ura [burnt >
burn]) or to the verbal stem (apretar > apret-ura [to squeeze > squeeze]). Fernández
Ramírez (1986) also points out that many participles can act as adjectives, meaning
this noun formation process would be similar to the formation of deadjectival nouns
ending in -ura (gordo > gordura [fat > fatness], alto > altura [high > height]). To back
this analysis is the fact that various deverbal nouns ending in -ura present the irregular
form of the participle: envuelto > envoltura [wrapped > wrapping], abierto > abertura
[open > opening], cubierto > cobertura [covered > cover].2 In addition, this derivative
line reflects the origin of the suffix itself, given that in Latin the base of the morpho-
logical process was the Latin perfect participle.
However, suggesting the participle as a base for deverbal noun formation in
Â�
Spanish poses various problems. Firstly, the participle is an inflectional form of a
verb, and therefore cannot be a base for morphological processes. In order to make
this Â�
possible, the participle must act as an adjective, as it does in other words such
as dejadez [slovenliness], osadía [daring] or pesadez [heaviness]. As Pena (2005)
mentions, in these cases, the nouns come from adjectives and present a deadjectival
meaning, therefore there are no other interpretations derived from the correspond-
ing participle. So, the noun dejadez is related to the adjective dejado [untidy]), and
not to the participle of the verb dejar [to leave]. If we apply the same reasoning to
deverbal nouns ending in -ura we warn that it is not possible to establish a deadjectival
Â�reading, since they do not denote qualities, like true deadjectival nouns with this Â�suffix
(gordura [fatness] = “quality of being fat”), but rather states or results related to the
verb Â�(quemadura [burn] = “mark produced by something that burns”). Secondly, as
observed by Santiago Lacuesta and Bustos Gisbert (1999), in various verbs the theme
vowel in the formation with -dura is different to that of the participle: torcedura/torcido
[twist/twisted], mordedura/mordido [bite/bitten], cosedura/cosido [stitch/stitched]. All
this leads us to believe that the base of deverbal nouns ending in -dura is the Â�
verbal
ïœ±.â•… In nouns such as abreviatura [abbreviation] and hilatura [spinning], taken as learned
words from Latin, Kester (1991) suggests a complex morphological analysis in order to
Â�
maintain the form -ura. According to this author, in these cases, the suffix -ura is added to a
verbal stem with a theme vowel and the intervention of the infix -t-: [abrevi]verbal root-atheme
vowel-tinfix-ura (abbreviation). If this is so, then we will have to explain why in these cases
the regular participle form is not adopted, that is, why we have no *abreviadura instead of
Â�
abreviatura.
ïœ².â•… Alemany (1918) proposes the irregular past participle for these words.
ïœ±ïœ¶ïœ¸	 Josefa Martín García
theme (root plus theme vowel) and that the suffix -dura presents two allomorphs:
-dura and -ura. Cases such as rotura [breakage] or abertura [opening] are forms which
have been inherited from Latin, built upon the Latin perfect participle, hence their
irregular form. In Spanish, there are no new words that correspond to this process.
Therefore, these forms cannot constitute an argument in favour of the suffix -ura
when joining participles.
Theallomorph-duraalsoselectsnounsandproducescollectivenounsÂ�(botonadura
[buttons], cornadura [horns], dentadura [teeth]), some of which have been Â�substituted
by other nouns built on the same base but with a more clearly Â�
collective suffix
Â�(cornadura/cornamenta). The allomorph -ura, in turn, is often confused with the Â�suffix
-ura, which selects adjectives to create nouns of qualities: gordura [fatness], altura
[height], dulzura [sweetness].
In some cases there are two nominalizations, seeing as both the learned form and
the patrimonial form have reached Spanish. Both words present different Â�
meanings,
either because the double form of nominalization breaks the ambiguity of action
Â�
nominalizations (1a, b), or because each noun is created from different senses of the
verb base (1c, d):
	 (1)	a.	apertura: “action of opening”
		b.	abertura: “result of opening”
		c.	ruptura: “action of breaking relations between people, countries”
		d.	rotura: “action and result of breaking a physical entity”
As regards the constraints of the morphological process we are looking at, we might
mention that the suffix -dura selects transitive verbs and unaccusative verbs, and
therefore requires an internal argument that deverbal nouns can inherit. In this sense,
deverbal nominalizations ending in -dura behave like any other deverbal noun. In
event nominalizations, the internal argument is compulsory and the external Â�argument
of transitive verbs appears as an adjunct:3
	 (2)	a.	
La voladura del puente por parte de las tropas enemigas tuvo lugar ayer
[The blowing-up of the bridge by the troops took place yesterday].
		b.	
La soldadura de la ventana por parte de un soldador cualificado duró
varios días [The welding of the window by a qualified welder lasted
several days].
ïœ³.â•… According to Grimshaw (1990) and Alexiadou (2001), event nominals cannot license two
genitive arguments, so the agent argument of the verb base becomes an adjunct introduced by
a preposition or a prepositional phrase. Thus, the realization of the agent argument is similar
in event nominals and in passive sentences: la destrucción de la ciudad por las tropas enemigas
(the destruction of the city by enemy troops)/la ciudad fue destruida por tropas enemigas
(the city was destroyed by enemy troops).
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ¶ïœ¹
Various event nominalizations come from unaccusative verbs, so all that appears is
the internal argument (3a) or the internal argument and a governed prepositional
phrase (3b):
	 (3)	a.	
La constante escocedura de los ojos le provocó una pérdida de visión
[The constant stinging in his eyes caused him to lose his sight].
		b.	
La repentina encalladura del barco en el arrecife ocurrió ayer en el
Pacífico [The sudden running aground of the boat against the reef
occurred yesterday in the Pacific].
Result nominalizations, in turn, can carry an internal argument inherited from
the transitive verb (4) or the unaccusative verb (5):
	 (4)	a.	
Añade a la masa la ralladura de limón [Add the lemon gratings
to the dough].
		b.	
Recogió las limaduras de hierro que había en el suelo [He picked
up the iron filings that were on the floor].
	 (5)	a.	
Trataron de destruir la ligadura de los núcleos [They tried to destroy
the binding of the nucleus].
		b.	
El masajista te curará la torcedura del tobillo [The masseur will cure
the twist of your ankle].
However, in many cases this argument may not appear:
	 (6)	a.	
Me curé la rozadura (del pie) con un desinfectante [I cured the graze
[on my foot] with disinfectant].
		b.	
Cayó enfermo por las frecuentes mojaduras (de los pies) [He fell ill due
to the frequent wetting [of his feet].
Bearing in mind the semantic properties of the nouns ending in -dura, we should
point out that deverbal nominalizations with this suffix present various meanings
(Monge 1970; Rainer 1993; Santiago Lacuesta & Bustos Gisbert 1999; RAE 2009): for
example, process (7a), result state (7b), result object (7c), object (7d), instrument (7e),
place (7g):
	 (7)	a.	
Durante la apertura del curso académico hubo varias protestas
Â�estudiantiles [During the opening of the school year there were a
series of student protests].
		b.	
La encalladura del barco en las rocas alertó a las autoridades [The
Â�
running aground of the ship against the rocks alerted the authorities].
		c.	
Tiene varias quemaduras por el cuerpo [He has various burns
on his body].
		d.	
He roto la cerradura para poder entrar [I broke the lock in order
to get in].
ïœ±ïœ·ïœ°	 Josefa Martín García
		e.	Va vestido con elegantes vestiduras [He is dressed in elegant clothing].
		f.	
Están limpiando la desembocadura del río [They are cleaning the river
mouth].
Various nominals are ambiguous, presenting more than one meaning: action and
result (8a), action and result object (8b), result object with two different meanings
(8c), result and place (8d):
	 (8)	a.	
La soldadura de la ventana duró varias horas/Arreglaron la soldadura de
la ventana [The welding of the window took several hours/They fixed
the welding on the window].
		b.	
Curé la escocedura de la herida con agua salina/Limpió las escoceduras
del muslo [I cured the irritation from the injury with salty water/He
cleaned the rash on his thigh].
		c.	
Tenía en el brazo una cortadura profunda/Echa a la salsa las cortaduras
de queso [He had a deep cut on his arm/Add the cheese cuttings to the
sauce].
		d.	
La defectuosa encajadura de las tablas provocó la caída del escenario/
Introduzca la pieza en la encajadura de la tabla [The faulty fitting of the
planks caused the stage to fall/Insert the piece in the slot in the plank].
In some cases, the different meanings come from different senses of the verbal stem:4
	(9)	
cortar [to cut]
		 a.	
“To create a gash in something” > la cortadura [del brato/del sillón]
[the cut] [in his arm/ on the sofa]
		 b.	
“To separate parts of something” > las cortaduras de queso [the cheese
cuttings]
	(10)	 escocer [to sting]
		 a.	
“To produce irritation” > La escocedura de la herida [The irritation
from the injury]
		 b.	
“To be irritated a part of the body” > Las escoceduras del muslo
[The rash on his thigh]
As regards the productivity of the morphological process we are studying, some
authors such as Rainer (1993) state that this suffix is no longer productive. Indeed,
Â�
several nominalizations ending in -dura have been replaced by other forms built
on the same verb but with a different suffix (cepilladura/cepillado [brushing],
ïœ´.â•… In Spanish dictionaries, it is not always specified which sense of the verbal stem the
Â�
nominalization comes from. For example, in the Diccionario de Uso del Español (DUE)
(Moliner 1968) encajadura is defined as “action of inserting”, while the meaning of the
Â�
deverbal noun only corresponds to the first sense of encajar [to insert]:“To put something or
part of it inside a slot in something else into which it fits”.
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ·ïœ±
Â�
flotadura/flotación [floating], alisadura/alisamiento [straightening], escotadura/escote
Â�
[neckline]). Â�
Nevertheless, in Latin-American Spanish, nominals ending in -dura are
more Â�
productive than in European Spanish. The following examples are taken from
the CREA5 (11) and different web pages (12):
	(11)	 a.	
La discusión fue áspera y terminó con una colgadura de teléfono
[The argument was heated and ended with the hanging up of the
phone]. (Caretas, 14–9–1995, Peru).
		b.	
Sufrí la quebradura de la clavícula [I suffered the breakage of my
Â�collarbone] (Últimas noticias, 27–12–2003, Uruguay).
		c.	

Nominals with the suffix -dura
3.1â•… Deverbal nominals
In the different works on deverbal nominalization two main groups have been
Â�
distinguished: event nominals and result nominals. Event nominals can be combined
with predicates that use events as their subject (13) or as their object (14):
	(13)	 a.	
La destrucción del puente por las tropas enemigas ocurrió ayer
[The destruction of the bridge by enemy troops occurred yesterday].
		b.	
La restauración del cuadro duró varios meses [The restoration of the
painting lasted several months].
		c.	
El resurgimiento del nuevo imperio tuvo lugar a principios de siglo [The
resurgence of the new empire took place at the turn of the century].
ïœµ.â•… Corpus de Referencia del Español Actual (http://www.rae.es).
ïœ¶.â•… The noun topeadura comes from the verb topear [“to push a rider another rider in order
to take this place”] and presents the meaning “Equestrian game which occurs when a rider
topea another rider”.
ïœ±ïœ·ïœ²	 Josefa Martín García
	(14)	 a.	
La lluvia provocó la destrucción del puente [The rain caused the
Â�
destruction of the bridge].
		b.	
La buena situación económica originó el resurgimiento del nuevo Â�
imperio
[The good economic situation lead to the resurgence of the new
Â�empire].
Within event nominals we can distinguish, as Grimshaw (1990) does, for example,
between complex event nominals and simple event nominals. The difference lies in
that the former have an argument structure. So, various complex event nominals could
also be simple if they did not have arguments:
	(15)	 a.	
La destrucción ocurrió ayer [The destruction occurred yesterday].
		b	
La explosión duró varios segundos [The explosion lasted several
Â�seconds].
Contrary to these nominals, result nominals do not present an event or process
Â�
interpretation, because they do not have an event argument (Grimshaw 1990) nor
functional categories associated to the verbal clauses (Alexiadou 2001). Furthermore,
they are referential with a discontinuous interpretation:
	(16)	 a.	
La construcción es muy sólida [The construction is very solid].
		b.	
Publicaron las dos traducciones de la novela [They published both
Â�
translations of the novel].
According to Grimshaw (1990), result nominals do not have an argument struc-
ture. However, as proven by Picallo (1991, 1999) or Alexiadou (2001), this kind of
Â�
nominalizations can present an internal argument. Thus, nominals such as the follow-
ing have an Â�
argument and do not offer an eventive reading:
	(17)	 a.	
Leyeron la definición de la palabra [They read the definition of the
word].
		b.	
Publicaron la traducción de La Ilíada de Juan [They published Juan’s
translation of The Iliad].
Dividing the nominalizations in two main groups, event and result, poses a problem
from the point of view of interpreting the deverbal noun, seeing as not all non-event
nominals can be included in the group of result nominals. Indeed, there are various
nominals, such as those in (18), that do not express the result of an action, though they
come from verbs of action or even from result verbs:
	(18)	 a.	 La envoltura del paquete [The wrapping on the package].
		b.	Las lameduras del perro [The licks from the dog].
In addition, nominalizations of stative verbs are neither events nor results, and so,
belong to a new type of nominalization.
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ·ïœ³
	(19)	 a.	
El continuo aburrimiento de Juan es preocupante [Juan’s constant
Â�
boredom is worrying].
		b.	
No podrás vivir con ese agobio constante [You won’t be able to live with
that constant stress].
In the light of all of this, we must recognize, as well as event nominals and result
Â�
nominals, others nominals with different interpretations, as pointed out by Comrie
and Thompson (1985) or Azpiazu (2004). Thus, nominalizations can have an inter-
pretation of event (20a), result state (20b), result object (20c), state (20d), non-result
object (20e), instrument (20f) and place (20g), among other possible meanings.

[The institution has a separate building for the public].
Nominals ending in -dura express various semantic contents and present different
Â�
syntactic behavior, seeing as not all of them have an internal argument inherited from
the verb. We have distinguished three groups of nominals ending in -dura, to each of
which we have devoted a section: event nominals, result nominals, and non-resultative
and non-eventive nominals.
3.2â•… Event nominals
Most event nominals ending in -dura come from transitive verbs and, as can be
expected of this type of nominalization, they have an internal argument inherited
from the verb and an adjunct that is the external argument of the verb (21a), and
which, therefore, does not necessarily have to be realized, as opposed to the internal
argument, which does (21b):
	(21)	 a.	
Los ciudadanos presenciaron la voladura del puente por parte de las
tropas enemigas [The citizens witnessed the blasting of the bridge
by the enemy troops].
ïœ±ïœ·ïœ´	 Josefa Martín García
		b.	
La botadura del barco ayer en el puerto de Gijón congregó a personas
muy distinguidas [The launching of the ship yesterday in the Gijón
harbour brought together some very distinguished people].
Less frequently, some nominalizations come from unaccusative verbs, and so the
nominalization inherits the internal argument of the verbal base (22a) and, in some
cases, the governed prepositional phrase (22b):
	(22)	 a.	
La accidental torcedura del tobillo tuvo lugar ayer durante el
Â�entrenamiento [The accidental twisting of his ankle took place
yesterday during training].
		b.	
La repentina encalladura del barco en el arrecife ha provocado varios
daños en la estructura del barco [The sudden running aground of the
boat against the reef has caused damage in the boat structure].
Consequently, the constraints that operate on the formation of event nominals Â�
ending
in -dura are verbal bases with an internal argument affected by the action, which
means the verbs are aspectually telic.
3.3â•… Result nominals
What the nominalizations studied in this section have in common is the fact that they
are constituted as the result of the action expressed in the verbal base. Consequently,
we can expect telic verbs that lead to the result of an action. This means that the Â�
verbal
bases denote complex events that contain a process subevent and a state subevent
(Pustejovsky 1995). That way, it is the state subevent that acts as a base on which the
result nominal is built. Result nominals ending in -dura come from telic verbs that lead
to the result of an action. So, if the dog has bitten Juan, the result of the action of biting
is the bite itself that Juan has (23a).
	(23)	 a.	
El perro ha mordido a Juan > la mordedura del perro [The dog has
Â�
bitten Juan > the dog bite].
		b.	
El barco ha encallado en el arrecife > la encalladura del barco [The ship
has run aground against the reef > the running aground of the ship].
Less frequently, we come across result nominals ending in -dura that come from atelic
verbal bases:
	(24)	 a.	
Los canalones chorrearon > La pared tiene varias chorreaduras de los
canalones [The gutters dripped > The wall had several drips marks
from the gutters].
		b.	
Los jabalíes hozaron la tierra > Los jabalíes dejaron la tierra con
Â�hozaduras [The warthogs nuzzled the ground > The warthogs left
nuzzle marks in the ground].
		c.	
El perro lamió la mano > Tengo la mano mojada con las lameduras del
perro [The dog licked my hand > My hand is wet from the dog’s licks].
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ·ïœµ
The result denoted by these nominals does not refer to the result of the event Â�mentioned
by the verb, in the words of Pustejovsky (1995), since they are atelic events. Instead it
refers to a result derived from the action. As we can see in the examples under (24), the
action denoted by the verbal bases is reiterative in the sense that different phases of the
action occur one after another. This series of actions is not quantified, which leads to
an atelic event. For example, in the case of lamer [to lick] there are different manifesta-
tions of the action, since the tongue licks several times. Given that the number of times
is not specified, the event is atelic. However, as we know, an atelic action takes place
each time it occurs, and each occurrence can be considered a resultant state (Parsons
1990). That way, if the dog has developed the action of licking, it is true that it has
licked and that action has produced a result that cannot be undone.
We must mention, however, that result nominals ending in -dura mainly come
from telic verbs with a state subevent. The result denoted by the nominalizations
can be considered a physical entity, that is, a result object obtained after the action
is Â�
completed, or a result state reached when the action takes place upon the internal
argument. Let us look in further detail at each of the two types of nominals.
3.3.1â•… Result-object nominals
Result-object nominals come from transitive verbs with an affected object and are,
therefore, telic verbs. The object affectedness is conceptualized in two different ways
with nominalizations ending in -dura. Firstly, there are nominalizations that denote a
mark or sign in the entity denoted in the internal argument of the verbal base:
	(25)	 a.	
quemar la mano > la quemadura de la mano [to burn the hand >
the burn on the hand].
		b.	
rozar el pie > la rozadura del pie [to graze the foot > the graze on
the foot]
		c.	
desollar la rodilla > la desolladura de la rodilla [to flay one’s knee >
the flaying on the knee].
	(26)	 a.	
desportillar el plato > la desportilladura del plato [to chip the plate >
the chip on the plate].
		b.	
despellejar la chaqueta de cuero > la despellejadura de la chaqueta
[to peel the leather jacket > the peeling on the jacket].
		c.	
desgarrar el pantalón > la desgarradura del pantalón [to tear the
trousers > the tear in the trousers]
The internal argument of the verb can refer to a human entity (25) or a non-human
entity (26) affected by the action. The verbal bases of the previous examples present
the causative/unaccusative alternation, so it is the unaccusative construction that
is Â�
constituted as the base of the nominalization ending in -dura. In these cases, the
Â�
internal argument of the verb is transferred to the nominalization to mark the relation
of possession, and is, therefore, an adjunct.
ïœ±ïœ·ïœ¶	 Josefa Martín García
	(27)	 a.	
La mano se ha quemado > la quemadura de la mano [The hand has
been burnt > the burn on the hand].
		b.	
El pie se ha rozado > la rozadura del pie [The foot has been grazed >
the graze on the foot].
		c.	
La rodilla se ha desollado > la desolladura de la rodilla [The knee has
been flayed > the flaying on the knee].
		 d.	
El plato se ha desportillado > la desportilladura del plato [The plate has
chipped > the chip on the plate].
		e.	
La chaqueta de cuero se ha despellejado > la despellejadura de la
Â�chaqueta [The leather jacket has peeled > the peeling on the jacket].
		f.	
El pantalón se ha desgarrado > la desgarradura del pantalón
[The trousers have torn > the tear in the trousers].
Only a few transitive verbs that do not have the unaccusative construction can lead to
nominalizations that denote marks in the internal argument. The resulting nominals
can hold one of the two verb arguments, but only as adjuncts:
	(28)	 a.	
El perro ha mordido a Juan > la mordedura del perro/la mordedura de
Juan [The dog has bitten Juan > the dog bite/Juan’s bite].
		b.	
El mosquito ha picado a Juan > la picadura de mosquito/la picadura de
Juan [The mosquito has bitten Juan > the mosquito bite/Juan’s bite].
In the case of the verb picar [to bite], the unaccusative construction is also possible with
a different meaning. The resulting nominalization presents the same Â�
characteristics as
the examples seen under (27).
	(29)	 a.	
Las muelas se han picado> las picaduras de las muelas [The tooth is
rotting > the rot on the teeth].
		b.	
El espejo se ha picado > las picaduras del espejo [The mirror is rusting >
the rust on the mirror].
The only case that does not comply with what we have mentioned about this group of
nominals is chorreadura [drip mark]. The verb chorrear [to drip] is intransitive and
atelic. The nominalization ending in -dura points at the result-object of chorrear and
takes as arguments both the source of the action (external argument) and the target
(locative adjunct):
	(30)	 a.	
Los canalones chorrean en la pared [The gutters drip onto the wall].
		b.	
Las chorreaduras {de la pared/de los canalones} [The drip marks
{on the wall/from the gutters}].
The second group of object-result nominalizations includes nouns that denote
the remains of the entity represented in the internal argument, once the action is
Â�
completed. So, nominalizations such as ralladura [gratings], limaduras [filings],
Â�
peladuras Â�
[peelings] or raspaduras [scrapings] indicate the remains left once the action
of rallar [to grate], limar [to file], pelar [to peel] or raspar [to scrape], respectively, are
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ·ïœ·
completed, modifying the entity represented in the internal argument. As opposed
to the nominalizations from the previous group, these are built upon the causative
Â�
construction of the verb:
	(31)	 a.	
Juan ha rallado el huevo > la ralladura de huevo [Juan has grated the
egg > the egg gratings].
		b.	
Juan ha limado el hierro > las limaduras de hierro [Juan has filed the
iron > the iron filings].
Some of the nominalizations from the previous group, that denote a mark in the
entity mentioned in the internal argument, can also mean the remains of the entity
Â�
represented by the internal argument, as is the case of cortaduras [cuttings] and
Â�
desportilladuras [chippings]:
	(32)	 a.	
cortadura: “Separation that remains of an object after being cut”,
Â�
“remains left while cutting something”.
		b.	
desportilladura: “Mark left on something chipped”, “piece that comes
off something chipped”.
Most of the nominalizations in this group are used in plural (cortaduras [cuttings],
limaduras [filings], serraduras [saw dust], peladuras [peelings], mondaduras Â�[peelings],
raspaduras [scrapings]).7 As we know, result nominals, as opposed to event nominals,
exhibit a discontinuous nature. Nominalizations from this group ending in -dura
denote remains, that is, unquantified entities. Therefore, the plural affix guarantees the
continuous character of these result nominals:8
Nominalizations that indicate remains are built using the internal argument of the
verbal base, guaranteeing the part-whole relation:
	(33)	 a.	
Hay mondaduras *(de naranja) en el suelo [There is *[orange] peelings
on the floor].
		b.	
Añade a la sopa cortaduras *(de queso) [Add *[cheese] cuttings to
the soup].
		c.	
No encontrarás en el mercado ralladura *(de plátano) [You won’t find
*[banana] gratings on the market].
3.3.2â•… Result-state nominals
Result-state nominals denote the final state of the internal argument of the verb once
the action is completed. We are, therefore, looking at telic verbs with a state Â�
subevent.
ïœ·.â•… Only the nominalization ralladura also uses the singular form in spite of its continuous
character: Hay mucha ralladura de limón [There is a lot of lemon gratings].
ïœ¸.â•… Some non-deverbal nouns with an inherent plural form mean remains or fragments
(añicos [smithereens], escombros [debris], migas [crumbs]) (RAE 2009). Just like these, the
nominalizations ending in -dura we are looking at are only used in plural.
ïœ±ïœ·ïœ¸	 Josefa Martín García
Those verbs that generate result-state nominals can be divided in two groups:
Â�
unaccusative verbs and transitive verbs.
Firstly, a group of verbs in their unaccusative alternations is the base for
Â�
result-state nominals ending in -dura, which are interpreted as the state in which
we can find the entity represented in the internal argument as a result of applying an
action or of the action taking place:
	(34)	 a.	
El tobillo se torció > la torcedura del tobillo [The ankle twisted >
the twist of the ankle].
		b.	
Los núcleos se ligaron > la ligadura de los núcleos [The nucleus were
bound > the binding of the nucleus].
		c.	
Los pies se mojaron > la mojadura de los pies [The feet got wet >
the wetting of the feet].
		d.	
El barco encalló en el arrecife > la encalladura del barco en el arrecife
[The ship ran aground against the reef > the running aground of the
ship against the reef].
Secondly, there are a few transitive telic verbs that lead to result-state nominals:
	(35)	 a.	
Juan encaja la pieza en el hueco > la encajadura de la pieza en el hueco
[Juan fits the piece into the slot > the fitting of the piece into the slot].
		b.	
Juan ensilla el caballo > la ensilladura del caballo [Juan saddles the
horse > the saddling of the horse].
In either of the two groups of verbs, the corresponding nominalization inherits the
internal argument from the verbal base. This also occurs in fixed expressions with a
nominal ending in -dura used in colloquial Spanish:
	(36)	 a.	
Me fastidian las frecuentes meteduras de pata de Juan [Juan’s frequent
making of mistakes annoys me].
		b.	
Esa respuesta fue una tomadura de pelo [That answer was a pulling of
the leg].
		c.	
Esta explicación es una comedura de coco [This explanation is
mind-boggling].
The verbs observed up to now present an aspectual telic nature. Along with these
verbs, we have also gathered two nominalizations derived from atelic verbs: lameduras
[licks] and apreturas [squeeze]. The verbs lamer [to lick] and apretar [to squeeze] have
no state subevent but, since they are continuous actions, they produce a state in each
phase of the action (Parsons 1990). So, if the dog has licked its puppies (37a), there is a
result, because the puppies have been licked. The atelicity of the verb is due to its reit-
erative character, which the nominalization inherits, hence it always appears in plural
to ensure its continuous interpretation (37b). This is a good example of how the aspect
is also inherited in nominalizations (Alexiadou 2001).
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ·ïœ¹
	(37)	 a.	 El perro lame a sus cachorros [The dog licks its puppies].
		b.	
Las lameduras del perro/*la lamedura del perro [The dog’s licks/the
dog’s lick].
In the case of the nominalization apreturas, the verbal base apretar is atelic in both of
its senses (38 a, b) that generate nominalizations (38c, d). Like in lameduras, it is always
used in plural and is, therefore, constituted as a continuous noun. For this Â�
reason, the
interpretation of this nominal is based on a series of unquantified states:
	(38)	 a.	
Las personas se apretaron durante todo el concierto [The people
squeezed together during the whole concert].
		b.	La necesidad aprieta [Need is upon us].
		c.	
En las rebajas, aumentan las apreturas en los grandes almacenes
[During the sales, the squeezing together of people in major
department stores increases].
		d.	
Con la crisis aumentan las apreturas para llegar a fin de mes [In
Â�
recession, the pressure to get to the end of the month increases].
In short, result-state nominals derived from telic verbs inherit the internal argument
of the verbal base and the verbal aspect, hence their discontinuity. Nominalizations
built on atelic verbs do not inherit the internal argument, since it is not affected by the
action, but do inherit the verbal aspect, so they must be expressed in plural in order to
guarantee a continuous interpretation.
3.4â•… 
Non-resultative and non-eventive nominals
Nominals included in this group do not denote events nor results of actions: cerradura
[lock], herradura [horseshoe], envoltura [wrapping], vestidura [clothing]. In some
cases, the verbal base has lead to another nominalization using a different suffix to
express action or result.
	(39)	 a.	
La cerradura de la puerta está rota [The lock on the door is broken].
		b.	
El accidental cierre de la discoteca provocó muchas quejas
[The accidental closing of the club caused a lot of complaints].
In other cases, the same nominalization presents two meanings: the result of the action
(40a) and a non-eventive and non-resultative meaning (40b):
	(40)	 a.	
La imperfecta encajadura de las tablas dejó pasar el aire [The faulty
fitting of the planks let the air through].
		b.	
Introduce la pieza en la encajadura de la tabla [Insert the piece in
the slot in the plank].
Nominalizations that express neither an event nor a result denote physical entities that
take part in the action expressed by the verb:
ïœ±ïœ¸ïœ°	 Josefa Martín García
	(41)	 a.	 herrar: “to put an herradura [horseshoe] on a horse”.
		b.	envolver: “to cover something with an envoltura [wrapping]”.
		c.	empuñar: “to hold a weapon in one’s hand by its empuñadura [handle]”.
And so, the different meanings that nominals from this group present are derived
from the verb complement that appears in the nominalization ending in -dura. One
group denotes objects that act as instruments in the action of the verbal base, which
is always transitive. Seeing as the content of the nominalization is included in the
verb meaning, we must define the scope of nominalization when it appears alongside
the original verb:
	(42)	 a.	
Cerrar la puerta con una cerradura automática [To lock the door with
an automatic lock].
		b.	
Herrar el caballo con una herradura nueva [To shoe the horse with a
new horseshoe].
		c.	
Envolver el paquete con una envoltura roja [To wrap the package in red
wrapping].
		d.	
Untar la piel con una untadura de aceite de pepino [To coat the skin
with cucumber oil].
		e.	Vestirse con una vestidura de seda [To dress in a silk dress].
		f.	
Pintar la pared con pintura plástica [To paint the wall with plastic paint].
A second group covers nominals that indicate part of the entity conveyed in the
internal argument, which becomes compulsory in the nominalization:
	(43)	 a.	
Empuñar la espada por la empuñadura > la empuñadura de la espada
[To hold the sword by the hilt > the hilt of the sword].
		b.	
Embrazar el escudo por la embrazadura > la embrazadura del escudo
[To hold the shield by the handle > the handle of the shield].
		c.	
Juntar la tubería y el grifo en la juntura > la juntura del grifo
[To join the pipe and the tap at the joint > the joint of the tap].
		d.	
Embocar la flauta por la embocadura > la embocadura de la flauta [To
blow the flute through the mouthpiece > the mouthpiece of the flute].
Lastly, some few nominals represent the place where the action takes place:
	(44)	 a.	 desembocadura: “place where a river desemboca [flows] to”.
		b.	
embocadura: “place through which a boat emboca [enter] a river
or harbour”.
		c.	encajadura: “slot into which something encaja [fits]”.
		d.	sepultura: “place where a dead person is sepultado [buried]”.
The nominalization desembocadura is built on an unaccusative verb with a governed
prepositional phrase. The nominalization only inherits the internal argument:
	(45)	 a.	 El río desemboca en el mar [The river flows into the sea].
		b.	Limpiaron la desembocadura del río [They cleaned the river mouth].
	 Deverbal nouns with the suffix -dura	 ïœ±ïœ¸ïœ±
The nominalizations embocadura and encajadura come from transitive verbs. In the
case of the former, the nominalization embocadura inherits the internal argument
in order to mark the part-whole relation; in the latter, encajadura is built using the
Â�locative argument:
	(46)	 a.	
El barco embocó el puerto > la embocadura del puerto [The boat entered
the harbour > the entrance to the harbour].
		b.	
Juan encajó la pieza en la tabla > la encajadura de la tabla [Juan slotted
the piece into the plank > the slot in the plank].
4.â•… 
The suffix -dura and Spanish nominalization: Final remarks
As we have already seen, nominalizations ending in -dura present various interpreta-
tions that go beyond the eventive and result content, making it necessary to recognize
other kinds of nominalization. The meaning of the deverbal noun is determined by the
meaning of the verb, which implies presuming the existence of a core meaning within
the verb (Levin 1999), inherited by the nominalization. We do no consider, in this
sense, that it is the suffix that carries the meaning content of the nominalization, since
this would mean having to recognize as many types of suffixes as semantic values we
can distinguish. If the nominalization inherits the constant meaning from the verbal
base, that is precisely what legitimizes the presence of the internal argument both in
event nominals and in result nominals.
As regards constraints, we pointed out in Section 2 that the suffix -dura mainly
selects telic verbal bases with an internal argument. However, there are verbs with
these characteristics that have never lead to a nominalization ending in -dura, for
example, verbs ending with the suffix -izar. As we have proven in Section  3, the
Â�suffix -dura has specialized in the formation of nominalizations denoting entities,
Â�
particularly, Â�
result-objects of an action. This has a series of consequences that allow
us to better understand how this suffix works within the nominal formation Â�
process
in Spanish. Firstly, event nominals ending in -dura, highly productive in other Â�
periods
of Â�
Spanish, have now been replaced by nominalizations using other suffixes that,
in a productive manner, lead to event nominals (cepilladura/cepillado [brushing];
Â�
flotadura/flotación [flotation]); other event nominals ending in -dura are disappear-
ing Â�(salpicadura [splash], freidura [fry up], peladura [peeling]). Furthermore, there
is often more than one nominalization of the verbal base, since the nominalization
ending in -dura expresses the result-object, and another nominalization built on the
same verb expresses the action and result state (magulladura/magullamiento [bruise/
bruising]; rozadura /rozamiento [graze/grazing]).
Secondly, the suffix -dura imposes very strong constraints on its bases, since
it requires verbal bases that can lead to a result-object after the action takes effect
on the internal argument. That way we can rule out of this word formation process
ïœ±ïœ¸ïœ²	 Josefa Martín García
verbs ending in -izar, since these verbs generate event and result-state nominals, not
Â�result-object nominals.
Thirdly, the constraints imposed by this suffix also determine the selection of
senses of the verb, which are not always the most commonly used in Spanish. For
example, the verb quemar [to burn] in its meaning “to destroy with fire” does not
Â�
generate a nominalization ending in -dura. Only in the sense of “producing injuries to
a person with fire or by exposure to sunlight” is it possible to create the nominalization
quemadura [burn].
Fourthly, the low productivity of the formation of nouns ending in -dura is due to
the very characteristics of the morphological process, which represents specialization
of suffixes and a way of putting an end to the ambiguity of action nominalizations.
In this sense, -dura is opposed to other nominalising suffixes because it does not
express action and, within its result meaning, specializes in objects.
Lastly, nominalizations ending in -dura are more productive in Latin-Â�
American
Spanish than in European Spanish. We must relate this fact to nominalizations ending
in -do, which are also more productive in Latin-America. Both suffixes are related to
the participle and form nominalizations from the same verbal base: rayada de papa/
rayadura de papa [confusion]; desabollado/desabolladura [dent removal]. In some
areas, the form ending in -do is preferred: metida de pata instead of metedura de
pata [mistake]; tomada de pelo instead of tomadura de pelo [leg-pulling]. Fábregas
(2010) points out this same connection between nominalizations ending in -do and
in -dera (gritadera [screaming], lloradera [crying], vomitadera [vomiting]), also more
Â�
productive in Latin-American Spanish.

On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope
of the concept of ‘light verb’*
María Antonia Martínez Linares
University of Alicante
This chapter is based on a previous article in which the features of protagonizar
and some other related verbs – usually labelled as agentive or similative – were
analyzed. Now it is argued that protagonizar is not in fact a semi-light verb,
despite the similarities that it shares with them. It is claimed that the features of
the utterances in which protagonizar appears may be explained through the basic
meaning of the verb, the semantic, sub-lexic, encyclopaedic or frame properties
of the noun which is expressed as the object, and the interaction between
both parameters. After examining the behavior of light and semi-light verbs,
it is argued that these features really make verbs like lanzar, cultivar, adquirir,
organizar or planear a special kind of verbs, extending the category.
Keywords:â•‡ Denominal verbs; agentive verbs; similative verbs; light verbs
1.â•… Introduction
There are relatively recent studies which suggest that verbs belonging to the ‘light’
class could be more extensive than they are usually assumed to be. With respect to
Â�
Spanish verbs, Blanco (2000), Bosque (2001a) and De Miguel (2006), for example, have
pointed out that some of the properties of prototypical ‘light’ or ‘support’ verbs – dar
[give], tener [have], tomar [take], hacer [make] – are also displayed by the so-called
“semilight verbs”, “extended support verbs” or “heavier light verbs”; that is, by verbs
like planear [plan], organizar [organize], cultivar [cultivate], lanzar [launch], adquirir
[acquire], truncar [truncate, frustrate], conceder [concede, grant] when they are used in
Â�
expressions like these: planear un viaje [plan a trip], organizar una campaña Â�
[organize
a campaign] [Bosque 2001a], cultivar una afición [cultivate a hobby], lanzar una
acusación [launch an accusation], truncar una relación [truncate a relationship] (De
Miguel 2006) or Â�
conceder una entrevista [give/grant an interview] (Blanco 2000:â•›104).

ïœ±ïœ¸ïœ¶	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
The verb protagonizar is1 not mentioned in works on ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verbs; nor
is it cited in studies on ‘collocations’ which, for some researches, are Â�
combinations that
favour the “emptying” of the verb (Bosque 2001a; De Miguel 2006) and expand the class
of ‘light’ verbs. It is usually mentioned only as an ‘agentive’ or ‘similative’ verb in semantic
classifications of denominal verbs formed with the suffix -izar. However, protagonizar
is included in REDES (Bosque 2004), a combinatory dictionary which, as Bosque says
(2004: XXII), many linguists consider a dictionary of collocations. Its ‘entry’ consists of
an “abridged series” which provides information about the Â�
combination of protagonizar
with nouns denoting events, such as sublevación [uprising], protesta Â�
[protest] or riña
[quarrel]. Moreover, as shown in a previous work (Martínez Linares 2009), constructions
with this verb show, at least apparently, characteristics that are similar to those attributed
to expressions with ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verbs: a relative “emptying” of lexical content, a
strong tendency to combination with ‘eventive’ nouns, or the “double syntactic structure”
which has been seen as “a standard property of light verbs” (Bosque 2001a: 26), and that
lanzar una acusación, for example, allows: La acusación contra el presidente que lanzó
[The accusation against the president that he launched], La acusación que lanzó contra el
presidente [The accusation that he launched against the president].
Given the apparent similarity between constructions with protagonizar and
‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verb constructions, the first aim of this work was to determine if
Â�
protagonizar could be included in that “extension” which encompasses expressions like
lanzar una acusación, alimentar una sospecha or truncar una relación. Nevertheless,
while analyzing constructions with protagonizar using the features of this class of verbs
as a base, it became clear that, as some recent investigations suggest, the scope of the
class of ‘light’ verbs is far from unquestionable. So, it has been judged appropriate to
include in this work some reflections on the properties attributed to ‘light’ verbs and the
“shadows” on the extension of the class that could arise from their relative vagueness.
2.â•… 
Protagonizar and the features of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs
There are two properties which are always present in the characterization of ‘light’ or
‘semilight’ verb constructions: the emptying of the verb and the predicative “weight”
of the noun that the verb takes as its complement. These main properties Â�
theoretically
ïœ±.â•… There is no transitive verb in English which can be considered an equivalent of Â�protagonizar
in all contexts. It can be translated as ‘to star in’ when it has the sense of “an actor playing an
important role in a movie or in a play”: Harrison Ford protagonizó la película, ‘Harrison Ford
starred in the movie”. But not when protagonizar means “X is part of Y with a prominent
role”, like in Las tropas americanas protagonizaron un conflicto or El paisaje protagoniza el
relato. The translation may be different depending on the noun which the verb takes as its
Â�
complement and the role of the subject in the event.
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ±ïœ¸ïœ·
Â�determinetherestofthefeaturesthatdistinguishtheseverbs–therestrictionsÂ�concerning
the nominalization process, the semantic equivalence between the ‘full’ sentence and a
nominalized phrase without the verb, the impossibility of expressing the ‘subject’ of the
noun as its complement, the ‘double structure’… – and, taking them as a base, there are
reasons to think that protagonizar could act as a ‘semilight’ verb in certain contexts.
2.1â•… The “emptying” of the verb
With respect to the meaning of constructions with ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verbs, it has been
claimed that the verb has no meaning, that it is empty of lexical content, that it shows a
weak predicative power or has little semantic weight. Thus, while alimentar [feed] shows
a full meaning in sentences like alimentó al ganado [he fed the cattle], in Â�
alimentar una
sospecha [feed a suspicion] the verb seems to have little lexical Â�
content because it has
undergone a change of meaning as a result of a process of metaphorization (De Miguel
2006:â•›
1293, 1307); consequently, it should behave like a standard support verb which
only gives a durative aspectual meaning to the predication.
The “emptying” of the verb implies that it lacks argument structure, is “themati-
cally” defective or is not fully “specified” in this aspect (Mendívil 1999:â•›86; Di Sciullo
& Rosen 1991:â•›13). Indeed, according to Bosque (2001a: 27), “light verbs do not seem
to have an argument structure” and lack external arguments. In terms of De Miguel
(2006:â•›1297),‘semilight’verbs,like acumularproblemas[accumulateproblems],adquirir
una Â�habilidad [acquire an ability], etc. share with copular and pseudo-copular verbs the
inability to select the subject or any other argument because they are not “predicates”.
The semantic deprivation of the verb has also been connected to the fact that
‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs cannot be nominalized because the nominalization Â�process
can only take place if the verb has lexical content (De Miguel 2006:â•›1293). Thus, as De
Miguel claims, the phrase el lanzamiento de peso [shot put throwing] is correct Â�because
it comes from the ‘full’ verb lanzar; but, from her point of view, el lanzamiento de una
acusación [launching an accusation] would be an odd expression because it is related
to the ‘semilight’ verb lanzar.
I will return later to the problem of the semantic content of these verbs. It could
be enough for the moment to indicate that protagonizar shows a certain emptying of
lexical content in many sentences, if we consider as proof of the “emptying” of the verb
the fact that it lacks external arguments or has lost its potential to “select” the subject.
Protagonizar combines with human subjects which display features of a prototypical
‘agent’ – animacy, volition, activity, dynamism, self-controlling – when this verb has
the ‘active’ meaning “an actor plays an important role in a movie or in a play”,2 as in
ïœ².â•… The Diccionario Salamanca de la lengua española (SAL) (Gutiérrez Cuadrado, 1996)
defines this sense as“representar 〈una persona〉 el papel de protagonista en [una obra de teatro
o una película]”.
ïœ±ïœ¸ïœ¸	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
María Schneider protagonizó El último tango en París. Although, when protagonizar
is used in the sense of “a person or a thing being the main figure of something (a fact,
an action…)”,3 it accepts a wide range of animate and inanimate subjects, as we can
see in the following texts:
	 (1)	

(CREA).

antigua
medina amurallada al barrio del mercadillo, zona que actualmente
Â�
protagoniza la vida económica de Ronda (CREA).
	(4)	
El sonido protagoniza la carga emocional del vocablo (CREA).
The behavior of protagonizar with respect to nominalization seems also to confirm
the “emptying” process. Nominalizations based on this verb appear to be specially
restricted when it means that “a person or a thing is the main figure of something”.
The CREA only includes 17 instances of protagonización and 16 of them fit the ‘active’
sense of “an actor plays an important role in a movie or in a play”, as in Resulta mucho
más completa la versión televisiva de ocho horas de 1981, con […] la protagonización de
Timothy Bottoms como Adam Trask.
2.2â•… 
The ‘eventive’ object
Studies on ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verb constructions usually highlight that the object of
the verb is a predicative noun; i.e. it is a deverbal or eventive noun4 with predicative
power and a considerable semantic weight, which displays its own argument structure
and determines the semantic content of the predication. Therefore, according to De
Miguel, the noun inclines the semantic “weight” towards its side and becomes the
semantic head of the predicate (2006:â•›1292, 1298).
As REDES states, the tendency to combine with eventive nouns5 is undoubtedly
a property that protagonizar shares with ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verbs. In the sentences
below, for instance:
ïœ³.â•… The Diccionario manual e ilustrado de la lengua español (DRAE) (Real Academia
Â�
Española, 1989) gives the following definition: “ser el principal personaje de cualquier hecho
o acción”; SAL defines this sense as“ser 〈una persona〉 o 〈una cosa〉 protagonista de [un asunto
o suceso]”.
ïœ´.â•… As Alonso Ramos (2004:â•›
115) says, it is unclear what a ‘predicative’ noun is. For some
researchers it is a ‘deverbal’ noun, for others it is an ‘abstract’ noun.
ïœµ.â•… When it is used in the“active”sense of “an actor plays the most important role in a movie
or in a play”, it combines with nouns like drama, película, serie, monólogo, opereta which
refer to“semiotic objects” or“artistic creations” and shares characteristics with both Â�

the direct objects of protagonizar are nouns with an argument structure similar to
that of lexically related verbs: the noun declaración [statement]implies an ‘agentive’
argument [la declaración del presidente] as does the verb declarar. Respuesta [answer]
selects an ‘agent’ and a ‘goal’ [la respuesta de la Otan a las provocaciones] just like the
verb responder.
In the following text, the complement is also an eventive noun that describes a6
hostile encounter between opposing forces that are involved as participants in the
noun’s ‘semantic frame’:7

nouns’ and ‘representation nouns’. By using as a guide the lexical groupings set up in REDES
and without trying to be too exhaustive, it must be highlighted that, when it means“a person
or a thing is the main figure in something”, the direct object of protagonizar can be an action
or deverbal noun denoting something which is discovered (hallazgo, descubrimiento), an
Â�informative unit (conferencia, mitin, entrevista, discurso), a verbal exchange (polémica,
debate, discusión, disputa), an action of protest with social relevance, (huelga, algarada, en-
cierro, manifestación, sentada), hostile or illegal actions (batalla, atentado, guerra, crimen,
estafa, agresión), or processes included in the semantic domain of “purpose” (iniciativa,
intento, Â�
tentativa, proyecto). The complement of protagonizar can also be a nominal phrase
Â�
referring to an unusual event (incidente, suceso, anécdota, acontecimiento, caso, escena, hecho,
Â�
sorpresa, episodio, accidente, escándalo), a social event where something is celebrated (acto,
celebración, fiesta, conmemoración), a process of economic,political, cultural or social change
(escisión, transición, cambio, progreso, movimiento), a collective action directed to a common
aim Â�(operación, negociación, sesión, cumbre), or a relevant action in sports competition (fuga,
Â�
escapada, espantada, salida, caída, carrera, remontada, sprint, pase, gol, tanto, jugada). In the
object position, we can find as well nouns denoting a time period during which an activity
takes place (temporada, jornada), either a relevant phase or a short fraction of time of an
event development (comienzo, final, momento, instante); there are also nouns referring to
a sequence of events (aventura, odisea, peripecia, viaje, expedición, vida) and many other
lexical types of eventive nouns that would be difficult to enumerate in this paper.

In the texts below, despite their semantic variety, the direct objects also have in
Â�
common the fact that they are eventive,8 predicative or deverbal nouns which may
select arguments or may be related to a ‘semantic frame’ involving various participants.

It is undeniable that the eventive noun has enough “weight” in the semantic predicate
configuration. In fact, it seems to be the most informative element, because it is the
noun, not the verb, that acts as the lexical constituent which lets us interpret – or infer –
how the subject participates in the event. In (21) and (22) the preferred reading could
be that the subject of protagonizar is the ‘agent’ which makes paradas de gran mérito or
carries out una gran actuación; on the contrary, in (23) we can only Â�understand that the
subject is an entity involved in a certain situación.

ïœ¸.â•… That is to say, nouns denoting an event that happens, takes place. These nouns combine
with verbs like durar [last], pasar [occur] or presenciar [witness]and can occur in prepositional
phrases introduced by durante[during]or a similar preposition (De Miguel 2006:â•›1295).
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ±ïœ¹ïœ±
Thus, not surprisingly, many sentences formed with protagonizar behave like ‘light’
and ‘semilight’ constructions in the tests which are generally used to underline the
semantic weight of the noun and the lexical emptiness of the verb.
As is known, it has been considered that a distinctive feature of light and semilight
verb constructions is the fact that they are often paraphraseable by means of a single verb
lexically related to the complement. Besar [to kiss], for instance, is a paraphrase of dar un
beso [give a kiss], acusar [accuse]is roughly equivalent to lanzar una acusación [launch
an accusation]. In accordance with this, protagonizar and the eventive noun can often be
replaced by a single verb related to the noun without changing the “preferred” reading of
the sentence from a referential point of view:
	 (24)	a.	 El fiscal general no protagonizó ninguna intervención (CREA).
b.	 No intervino ninguna vez.
	 (25)	a.	
Del Burgo […] protagonizó un enfrentamiento con el

b.	 Se enfrentó con Vicente Calderón.
	 (27)	a.	 Ramírez protagonizó una discusión con Jaime Bonilla (CREA).
b.	 Ramírez discutió con Jaime Bonilla.
We might add that sometimes constructions with prototypical ‘light’ verbs can be
equivalent to constructions with protagonizar, as if it were really a variant of a basic
light verb:
	(28)	 Protagonizó/hizo una declaración plagada de evasivas.
	(29)	
La constructora FCC fue la que protagonizó/realizó la aplicación de mayor

Manila-Madrid (CREA).
	(31)	

el Centro de la Mujer.9
Different studies on ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs have also pointed out that the
Â�
deletion of the verb may result in a nominal phrase semantically equivalent to the
full Â�
sentence (De Miguel 2008:â•›
568; De Miguel 2006:â•›
1293; Blanco 2000:â•›
101); Luis

a María, La acusación de Juan. If we examine sentences (30)–(32) and (36)–(37) for
ïœ¹.â•… The final appendix includes the webs from which the texts that do not come from the

ïœ±ïœ¹ïœ²	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
instance, again, it must be admitted that the nominal phrases El enfrentamiento de Del
Burgo con el aparato regional, Su enfrentamiento con Vicente Calderón, La discusión
de Ramírez con Jaime Bonilla, El famoso vuelo Madrid-Manila de Eduardo González
Gallarla and La charla del abogado malagueño en el Centro de la Mujer preserve the
sense of the corresponding full sentences with the verb, as far as the event type and
the participation of the entities involved in it are concerned.
According to Bjierre (1999) and De Miguel (2006), the role of the eventive noun in
the aspectual composition of the predicate also proves its semantic weight: the ‘aspect’
of the noun conditions the aspectuality of the predication. For example, dar un beso is
a ‘punctual’ predicate because of the aspectual properties of beso, while dar fuerzas has
a ‘durative’ sense due to the bare noun fuerzas.
As regards this feature, it seems clear that the semantic characteristics of the
nouns that protagonizar takes as complements can diversify the aspectual Â�properties of
the sentences. For example, the internal duration implied in vida cultural de Â�
Holanda,
ampliación or revolución is different from that involved by gol, which is a ‘punctual’
noun. So protagonizar la vida cultural de Holanda can be used in the Â�present tense form
and has an “extended present” interpretation and is also compatible with Â�
adverbial
phrases like desde unos días. Protagonizar una ampliación/la revolución can occur in
the construction “estar + gerund” which has a progressive sense, but Â�
protagonizar
un gol does not accept that construction nor is it compatible with the same type of
Â�adverbial phrases:
	(32)	
Éste es el «leitmotiv» de la muestra que desde hace unos días protagoniza
la vida cultural en Holanda (CREA).
	(33)	

Los voluntarios están protagonizando la revolución emergente de final
de siglo (CREA).
	(35)	 
Mutiu protagonizó/??protagoniza/??está protagonizando el segundo gol, que
sentenciaba el partido (CREA).
Given the compositional nature of aspectuality, maybe the influence of the eventive
noun on the ‘aspect’ of the predication cannot be considered a distinctive feature
of constructions with light verbs; undoubtedly, the role assigned to the argument
structure of the noun in the predicate configuration is much more relevant because
it is linked to the supposition that the verb has no argument structure or lacks the
external argument and then it cannot subcategorize complements or semantically
select the subject.
The noun, as the semantic head of the predication, becomes the lexical element
that gives its actants to the verb (Alonso Ramos 2004:â•›
24), provides the arguments
for the predication (Herrero Ingelmo: 2000) or transfers its theta-roles to the verb
(Romero 2007:â•›3). In the terms of Langer (2004:â•›172), the fundamental idea of a ‘light’
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ±ïœ¹ïœ³
verb construction is the realization of the arguments (i.e. the semantic actants) of
the predicative noun as syntactic actants of the verb. According to Herrero Ingelmo
(2000:â•›
4), for instance, in Roberto ha hecho una descripción del paisaje, the verb is
“allegedly” empty from a predicative point of view because “it has no arguments”, so
the “supported” noun is the constituent that imposes its arguments.
Consequently, it has been claimed that the subject of the verb is the semantic “sub-
ject” or the “first argument” of the eventive noun (Quochi 2007:â•›7; Gaatone 2004:â•›24;
Koike 2001:â•›80). Other studies are less restrictive with respect to the noun argument
that must be given or transferred, but they also claim that the syntactic subject must
be an ‘argument’ – not exclusively the subject – or a participant of the event denoted
by the noun (Danlos 2009:â•›1). Bosque (2001a: 27), for example, says that John is the
external argument of walk in John took a walk to the beach; similarly Danlos (2009:â•›4)
claims that in Ce politicien a mené une attaque contre le libèralisme the subject of the
‘light’ verb is the ‘agent’ of attaque.
The transmission of an argument from the noun to the syntactic subject of the
verb supports another feature usually regarded as something distinctive of ‘light’
verbs: the semantic subject of the noun encoded cannot be expressed again as a
possessive determiner or as an “agentive” complement – in a broad sense – (Langer
2005:â•›191; Mendívil 1999:â•›115); thus, someone can “give my candy”, for example, but
cannot “give my kiss” or “my explanation” (Blanco 2000; De Miguel 2006). Similarly,
the Â�construction Luc a lancé un attaque de Marie contre Max is not acceptable because,
in the terms of Danlos (2009:â•›4), “un (proto)-rôle thématique d’un prédicat ne peut
être réalisé qu’une seule fois”.
Therefore, it is important to emphasize that the syntactic subject of protagonizar
is always an argument, actant or participant of the event denoted by the predicative
noun. In the following texts the subject must be indeed understood as a participant in
the escapada, encuentro, enfrentamiento, beso, guerra, diálogo, sanciones. Furthermore,
the subject can be understood as the “semantic subject” of the noun. That is to say,
the gramatical subject is also the person who carries out la escapada, el encuentro, el
enfrentamiento, el beso, la guerra, el diálogo, las sanciones:

Regarding the constraints on the expression of the subject, it is true that we can find
many sentences with protagonizar where, in fact, the noun does not allow a Â�
possessive
determineroran“agentive”complementwithoutchangingthepreferredinterpretation.

However, as suggested before, the alleged transmission of arguments or participants
in constructions with ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verbs not only affects the subject of the verb
but also the complements, because “the verb does not semantically subcategorize any
of its syntactic complements” (Langer 2004:â•›
172). So, in hizo un disparo contra Pepe
and hizo una oferta al policía the prepositional phrases contra Pepe, al policía should
be “legitimated” by the nouns disparo and oferta (Mendívil 1999:â•›102, 107) because the
verb hacer “by itself does not take a+FN complements” (Ruppenhofer et al. 2006:â•›53).
This supposition is connected to the double syntactic configuration which has
been underlined as a standard property of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs: they might have
a single complement – a direct object –, as in (a), or two complements – a direct objet
and a prepositional phrase – as in (b); in other terms: the prepositional phrase might
be analyzed as an argument of the eventive noun (a) or as a prepositional complement
of verb10 (b) (De Miguel 2008:â•›570). On the contrary, “full” verbs, like criticar, would
only allow a syntactic configuration, as the oddness of 49 b suggests:
	(46)	 a.	 El paseo por la playa que Juan dio.
		
b.	 El paseo que Juan dio por la playa.

ïœ±ïœ°.â•… According to the RAE’s new grammar (2009:â•›902), in El atentado contra el presidente que
planeaban, ‘contra el presidente’ should be a complement of the noun atentado; in El atentado
que planeaban contra el president, this same phrase is a verb complement.
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ±ïœ¹ïœµ
Taking into account the syntactic behavior of protagonizar with respect to these
Â�
characteristics, it must be emphasized that the noun really “enriches” the Â�
predicative
power of the verb (Mendívil 1999:â•›
175), that it contributes in some way to the
Â�
“legitimation” of the complements which can appear in the sentence. For instance,
Â�
protagonizar una huelga/una manifestación/ un encierro/ una sentada admit comple-
ments with the preposition contra, but protagonizar un accidente/una caída/una boda
do not accept this type of complements although they have the same verb. So we can
think that the nouns huelga, manifestación, encierro, sentada, which refer to various
forms of protest, are the lexical elements that allow the realization of the complement
referring to the entity against which the protest is directed.
Given that this syntactic feature has been highlighted as a distinctive property
of light verbs, it must be stressed that we can find many sentences with protagonizar
which allow this double configuration. For instance, in (5) Las respuestas militares
que ha Â�
protagonizado hasta ahora la OTAN a las provocaciones de las fuerzas serbo-Â�
bosnias, the ‘goal’ of respuesta occurs as a verbal complement; but the sentence can be
Â�transformed into Las repuestas militares a las provocaciones de las fuerzas Â�
serbobosnias
que ha Â�
protagonizado hasta ahora la OTAN where the ‘goal’ argument is linked to
the noun denoting the event. The following text extracted from the CREA contains a
Â�construction with ataque as a complement of the noun respuesta:
	(50)	
La invasión de Uganda por tropas tanzanas, apoyadas por exiliados políticos del
régimen de Amin, parece ser una respuesta al ataque a la frontera tanzana que
protagonizaron hace unos meses varias unidades de élite del Ejército ugandés.
In fact, the CREA and other sources also provide a broad sample of sentences with
protagonizar that seem to permit this double configuration.11 Let us take the following
texts by way of examples:
	(51)	 a.	

Therefore, if we take into account all the utterances containing protagonizar which
have been mentioned, it seems that constructions with this verb fit the characteristics
attributed to the lexical units that expand the basic ‘light’ or ‘support’ verbs class, and
then protagonizar, like lanzar, alimentar, etc. should be analyzed as a verb which makes
it possible for a predicative, deverbal or eventive noun, with a great semantic weight, to
become the semantic head of the predication.
However, at the beginning of this work it has been said that protagonizar exhibits
properties of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs “at least apparently” because there are many
other texts which give us reasons to question the properties which delineate the con-
cept of ‘light’ verbs and support the extension of the class being suitably assigned to
constructions with this verb.
3.â•… 
The “weight” of protagonizar: Differences with respect to ‘light’ verbs
It has been suggested before that protagonizar seems to have undergone a loss
of Â�
semantic features when it means that a person or a thing is the main figure in
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ±ïœ¹ïœ·
Â�
something, because it does not select a subject as it does when it has the “active” sense
of a ‘performance’ verb.
However, if it is assumed as a “necessary condition” of ‘light’ or ‘semilight’
verbs that they be absolutely empty of lexical content, then it must be admitted that
Â�
protagonizar does not fit this concept.
In accordance with the meaning of protagonista, protagonizar conveys the basic
meaning “the subject X is in/participates in/is part of the event Y as a protagonist/with
a relevant role.” Thus, the verb not only forces us to interpret the subject as a Â�participant
of the event evoked by the direct object but, like sobresalir or destacar (‘stand out’), it
also informs about the “prominence” of the subject in that event.
Similarly, if it is accepted that a ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verb must “borrow” the
Â�
subject and the complements from the noun, or that the noun must assign a thematic
role to the subject, then we have to conclude that protagonizar does not behave like a
‘semilight’ verb.
It is true that, as said before, the subject of protagonizar must be understood as a
‘participant’ of the event denoted by the noun; it is also obvious that this verb admits
a broad range of animate and inanimate subjects; it could also be said that it lacks
an external argument, if this concept involves an ‘agent’ or a similar thematic role
Â�
(Grimshaw 1990:â•›33). It is undeniable that the semantic characteristics of the subject
(for example, the fact that it is ‘human’), the properties of the direct object – its argu-
ment structure, its encyclopedic, sublexical12 or ‘frame’ properties –, other comple-
ments and even the context can lead us to interpret that the subject of protagonizar
carries out the action denoted by the eventive noun, so it could be identified as the
‘agent’ of the nominal phrase. In the following texts it could indeed be inferred that the
human Â�
subjects “debated” each other (62) or with another person:
	(61)	 Cristina Kirchner protagonizó un debate con su par de Francia.
	(62)	 Santos y Mockus se atacan protagonizando un flojo debate.
	(63)	
Carlos Bravo, miembro de Greenpeace y activista en contra de la energía
nuclear protagonizó un debate con anterioridad en Partiendo de Cero.
Nevertheless, it would be inaccurate to suppose that this meaning is encoded by the
clause construction because the noun “transmits” a certain argument to the verb;
the same verb and noun combination may produce different interpretations or may
cause ambiguity regarding the role of the subject of protagonizar in the event evoked
by the noun. In the following texts the subject of the verb must be understood as the
‘topic’ of the debate:
ïœ±ïœ².â•… That is, the class of properties that Pustejovsky (1995:â•›
85–86) encodes in the
Qualia Â�
Structure, such as material composition, part structure, orientation, shape, color,
Â�
dimensionality, origin, purpose, function, and so on (Lieber, 2004:â•›10). Some scholars claim
that these properties are encyclopedic and perhaps they are not formalisable.

	(67)	 ‘Joe, el fontanero’ protagoniza el último debate de Obama y McCain.
	(68)	 Rosa Díez protagoniza el debate del candidato con el grupo mixto.
In the texts below it is not clear if the subject participates as a “speaker” in the verbal
interchange or if it is the topic discussed by the interlocutors:
	(69)	
‘O Baixinho’ protagonizó un debate similar en Brasil en las vísperas del
Â�
Mundial de 2002.
	(70)	 Gerardo protagonizó el último debate de esta edición [de Gran Hermano].
Also, according to the most natural reading of the following sentences:
	(71)	
Esta filial de Planeta […] protagonizó un espectacular lanzamiento basándose
en la edición de libros sobre vigencias sociales (CREA).
	(72)	 VISA protagonizó la mayor oferta pública de la Bolsa de Nueva York.
Visa and Planeta should be the entities which have carried out the espectacular lanza-
miento or the mayor oferta pública de la Bolsa de Nueva York; on the contrary, in the
sentences below the subject must be understood as the entity which “has been offered”
or “has been launched”.
	(73)	
‘El juego del ángel’ protagoniza el mayor lanzamiento internacional de una
novela española.
	(74)	 Manteles y caminos de mesa protagonizan la oferta de DMC para este otoño.
In 75–77 the subject of protagonizar is not the entity which “discovers” something,
“besieges” or “carries out the investigation project”:
	(75)	
Urano, con cinco satélites, protagonizó un reciente descubrimiento
Â�astronómico (CREA).
	(76)	
El lugar protagonizó un histórico asedio en el transcurso de la Guerra Civil
(CREA).
	(77)	
Los primates son de los animales que más se estudian en cautividad y que más
proyectos de investigación protagonizan (CREA).
although other sentences with the same complements allow that interpretation: Estos
científicos protagonizaron un gran descubrimiento, El ejército protagonizó un histórico
asedio, Estos médicos protagonizan un interesante proyecto de investigación.
Therefore it seems that we cannot claim that the noun “gives” or “transfers” a
Â�
certain argument to the verb, or that it assigns a theta role to the subject. Â�
Furthermore,
it is not self-evident that the subject of protagonizar necessarily coincides with
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ±ïœ¹ïœ¹
an Â�
argument of the noun, in the strict sense of the term ‘argument’. Jornada [day],
semana [week] and aventura [adventure] are eventive nouns; we must interpret that
the Â�
subjects (Numancia de la Sagra, Sergio Pitol, Torje Jarbal) take part in the event
denoted by the noun, but which would be the argument structure of jornada, semana
or aventura? These nouns involve ‘participants’, but do they really select arguments?
Which should be the thematic role that they assign to “their subject”?
	(78)	 Numancia de la Sagra protagonizó ayer una jornada emotiva (CREA).
	(79)	 Sergio Pitol protagoniza una gran semana en la Casa de América (CREA).
	(80)	 Torje Jarbal […] protagonizó la aventura científica del Acontiqui (CREA).
Sentences (61)–(80) codify that the subject is/participates in the debate, the offer, the
launching, the investigation project, the day, the week, the adventure, etc. and has a
“prominent” role; however, the fact that the subject could have a particular role (‘agent’,
‘patient’ or any other “classic” semantic role) is not part of the meaning encoded by
the construction. Therefore, we can think that the interpretation of the subject as a
participant of the event comes from the semantic properties of the verb, not from its
“emptiness”, while its role in the event could be inferred from its semantic character-
istics and the argument structure or the sublexical or ‘frame’ information associated
to the object.
It must also be pointed out that if protagonizar cannot select an external argument
or, in other words, if it admits a broad range of entities as syntactic subjects, this is also
due to its basic meaning. It establishes a locative relationship between the subject and
the direct object (Martínez Linares 2009:â•›207), which implies a lexical structure with a
semantic component like “BE”, and this kind of meaning component should disallow
the selection of an external argument (Harley & Noyer; 2000:â•›11).
If the verb is not totally empty of lexical content, if the noun does not give or
Â�transferitsargumentstotheverbanddoesnotassignathematicroletotheÂ�grammatical
subject, then it is to be expected that constructions with the verb protagonizar do not
invariably fit the features that the studies on ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs have linked to
those aspects.
Firstly, this is what happens with the hypothesis that the eventive noun cannot
express its “subject” as a complement or as a possessive determiner. In sentences
(67) and (68), for example, the ‘agents’ of the “debate” are expressed as nominal
Â�complements: el último debate de Obama y MacCain, el debate del candidato. In
the following texts extracted from the CREA, the “subject” of the eventive noun is
also explicit; it may coincide with the grammatical subject of the sentence, like in
(86)–(87); but it may also be a different entity, like in the rest of the sentences:
	(81)	

	(87)	

Â�
versos, protagonizó su primera tentativa de suicidio (CREA).
Secondly, given that the subject of protagonizar is not necessarily the ‘agent’ or any
other argument to which the noun assigns a thematic role, it is not always the case that
the combination of protagonizar with a certain eventive noun – debate, for example –
could be replaced by a ‘full’ verb, nor can we always use a standard ‘light’ verb instead
of protagonizar, if that ‘light’ verb requires an ‘agent’ or an ‘initiator’ of the event. As
said before, El abogado madrileño protagonizó una charla el pasado viernes might be
referentially equivalent to El abogado madrileño dio una charla el pasado viernes, but
obviously it is not possible to subsitute dio (‘gave’) for protagonizó in the sentence La
violencia de género protagonizó las charlas, because the subject is interpreted as the
topic, not the ‘agent’, of the talk.
Likewise, although in (69)–(71) protagonizar un debate could be replaced by debatir
without substantially changing the interpretation of the sentences, that substitution
is not possible in El cambio climático protagoniza el debate más conflictivo de la XVII
asamblea de la OMT, El vino de la boda de Cospedal protagoniza el Debate de Castilla-La
Mancha, La sentencia pendiente de Tribunal Constitucional sobre el Estatut protagoniza
el debate político en Cataluña, due to the fact that debatir, unlike Â�
protagonizar, requires
an agentive subject; nor is this substitution feasible in ‘Joe, el fontanero’ protagoniza el
último debate de Obama y McCain o en Rosa Díez protagoniza el debate del candidato
con el grupo mixto, because these sentences do not mean that Joe el fontanero o Rosa Díez
debated with somebody. The same could be said about protagonizar un descubrimiento/
un asedio/una oferta with respect to descubrir, asediar, ofrecer, as can be deduced from
the sentences with these complements previously described.
Third, it is doubtful that the deletion of protagonizar could result in a nominal
phrase which preserves the exact meaning of the corresponding full sentence. If this
verb not only means that the subject participates in the event but also informs about
its “prominence” in that event, we must admit that this information would be lost
when the verb is deleted. El vino de la boda de Cospedal protagoniza el Debate de
Â�
Castilla-La Mancha, Rosa Díez protagoniza el debate del candidato con el grupo mixto
all mean that the subjects were the “absolute protagonists” of the debate, and that the
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ²ïœ°ïœ±
meaning Â�
component is not encoded in El debate de Castilla-La Mancha sobre el vino
de Cospedal, El debate del candidato sobre Rosa Díez, although, due to the argument
Â�
structure of the noun debate, we could still interpret that el vino de Cospedal and Rosa
Diez were the “topic” of the “debate”.
Finally, it has also been said that ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs “are – to a certain
extent – lexically selected by their complements” (Bosque 2001a: 27); for example, “walk
Â�
lexically selects take” in the same way that “we choose the verb cometer Â�
‘commit’ for
different types of crimes and offences” (Bosque 2001a: 28). Regarding this Â�
feature, it is
worth pointing out that constructions with protagonizar could be categorized asÂ�‘colloca-
tions’, because this verb displays a strong tendency to combine with nouns referring to
“prominent”, “infrequent” or “important” events in different domains; that these nouns
and the verb share a meaning component; and that there is a Â�
semantic selection between
them. Nevertheless it is obvious that the selection of Â�
protagonizar is not lexically deter-
mined by the complement in the same way that paseo, for example, imposes the selection
of dar (De Miguel 2008:â•›571; Bosque 2001b: 15; Alonso Ramos 2007:â•›36, 440).
Takingintoaccountthesedata,wecanconcludethatprotagonizarisnotaÂ�‘semilight’
verb. On the contrary, we believe that the characteristics of Â�
constructions with this
verb are simply due to the fact that the basic content of protagonizar Â�
“interacts” with
the semantic properties of its complements to give rise to the “composite” Â�
meaning of
the sentence.
4.â•… 
“Shadows” on the extension of the concept of ‘light’ verbs
If we admit that protagonizar is not a ‘semilight’ verb we can still ask, for example, why
many constructions with this verb display the double syntactic configuration which
has been considered a standard property of ‘light’ verbs.13
Perhaps for the moment we cannot convincingly explain the behavior of
Â�
protagonizar with respect to the double configuration, but it should be enough
to Â�
highlight that, despite its relevance in the identification of ‘light’ verbs, this is a
Â�
“curious” Â�
property (Mendívil 1999:â•›168) which raises many doubts.
In any case, the “double analysis” is not the only feature of ‘light’ or ‘semilight’
verbs that gives rise to doubts. If on the grounds of the “emptiness” of the verb and the
transmission of arguments it could be said that protagonizar does not behave exactly
as a ‘semilight’ verb, it is important to stress that those two properties and the Â�
features
ïœ±ïœ³.â•… There are constructions with protagonizar which do not accept the double structure; for
example, A pesar del rechazo a ese proceso que protagonizó el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores
ruso en 1994 (CREA) cannot be transformed into El rechazo que protagonizó el ministro a ese
proceso.
ïœ²ïœ°ïœ²	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
related to them seem to be rather elusive when projected onto constructions with
Â�
‘semilight’ verbs or even with prototypical ‘light’ verbs, such as dar ‘give’ or hacer ‘make’.
4.1â•… 
On the meaning of the verb
According to different scholars, the questions concerning the “emptying” of lexical
content are rather fuzzy. In fact, there are discrepancies about the meaning – or lack of
meaning – of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs.
It has often been claimed that the verb has no meaning, that it is really devoid
of lexical content (De Miguel 2006:â•›1290); nevertheless, it has also been said that the
verbs simply “ont un argument externe dûment spécifié” (Di Sciullo & Rosen 1991:â•›14)
and that “their lexical semantic specifications are so general that they can be used
in a multitude of contexts” (Butt 2010:â•›72), two features that are present in sentences
with protagonizar. From the point of view of other researches, the verbs “seem to have
very little semantic content” (Bjierre 1999:â•›
4), their meaning “is reduced to a small
set of semantic features that are relevant for very large subclasses of verbs” (Langer
2004:â•›
173) or they are “semantically bleached versions of main verbs” i.e. they have
undergone “a loss of meaning that can be conceived as a loss of semantic features”
(Butt & Geuder 2003:â•›302). May be these descriptions are not too precise, but they at
least imply that the verb “is clearly not entirely devoid of semantic predicative power
content” (Butt 2010:â•›48).
It would be really difficult to hold that the verb is only a grammatical tool with-
out lexical content in constructions like lanzar una acusación, alimentar una sospecha,
truncar una relación, or even in prototypical constructions such as dar un beso or reci-
bir un bofetón.
This supposition is not consistent with the existence of ‘inverse’ ‘support’ or ‘light’
verbs. Obviously tomar un baño [take a bath] does not have the same meaning as
dar un baño ‘give a bath’, nor is dar un bofetón [give a slap] equivalent to recibir un
bofetón [receive a slap], although all these verbs have been equally catalogued as ‘light’
or ‘support’ verbs (Alonso Ramos 2004:â•›64). It is also difficult to argue that the verb of
these phrases does not contribute to the propositional meaning, that it only actualizes
the main predicate denoted by the noun (Alonso Ramos 2004:â•›63–64). It is true that
the event denoted by bofetón involves an ‘agent’ and a ‘recipient’ or ‘goal’, but we just
choose between dar and recibir depending on the perspective profiled by each verb
due to its lexical content.
The lack of content does not seem to be in accordance with the fact that the same
noun can combine with different ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verbs which not only Â�
diversify
the aspectual content but also convey other subtle differences in meaning. One can
Â�
alimentar sospechas or multiplicarlas; the verbs express a ‘durative’/ ‘habitual’ or Â�‘iterative’
aspectual content (De Miguel 2006:â•›1407; Blanco & Buvet 2004:â•›33). But these two verbs
differ in other meaning components; this should explain, for example, that multiplicar
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ²ïœ°ïœ³
las Â�sospechas allows an ‘ergative’ or ‘anticausative’ construction – Se Â�
multiplicaron las sos-
pechas – but alimentar las sospechas gives rise to a se-passive construction which presup-
poses a defocused ‘agent’: Se alimentan las sospechas. Similarly, las relaciones se truncan,
se rompen, se cultivan; as opposed to cultivar, romper and truncar mean, according to
their lexical content, that las relaciones “become broken”, “stop existing”, but their seman-
tic contribution cannot be reduced to a ‘resultative aspect’ (De Miguel 2006:â•›1307). On
the contrary, truncar preserves something of the sense of “to prevent the realization or
the total development of something”,14 which is different from the meaning of romper.15
The links between ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs and metaphorization processes
points in the same direction. According to Butt and Geuder (2003:â•›302), the metapho-
rization process plays an important role in the loss of semantic features which has been
attributed to ‘light’ and ‘semilight verbs’, because it “implies a progressive emptying
of the primary (physical, concrete) senses” which results “in the verb taking a more
generic sense”, although the process does not totally destroy the original sense of the
verb. In fact, De Miguel (2006:â•›1308) claims that many ‘semilight’ verb constructions,
like lanzar una campaña, adquirir una infección/fama, alimentar una sospecha, could
be explained by means of a change from a concrete basic meaning to a figurative sense
that implies a reduction of the verbal content. For example, according to Rumshisky
and Batiukova (2008:â•›35) the primary sense of lanzar, ‘launch’, which is to “physically
propel an object into the air or water” (lanzar un misil/ ‘launch a missile’), gives rise,
through metaphorical extension, to the senses “begin or initiate an endeavor”, or “cause
something to be in a place by means of an impulse” (De Miguel 2008:â•›575) which the
verb displays not only when combined with eventive nouns, as in lanzar un ataque/una
campaña [launch an attack/ a campaign], but also, for example, in lanzar un producto
[launch a product] or in lanzar a José Mª Aznar a los medios. Something similar could
be said with respect to the senses of adquirir ‘acquire’, “purchase or become the owner
of property” [acquire land] and “take on certain characteristics”, a “weak” sense “which
refers to some extremely light generic association” (Rumshisky & Batiukova 2008:â•›38),
like “acquire an infection”. Therefore the verbs would have undergone “a progressive
emptying of the primary (physical, concrete) sense” (2008:â•›38) that would culminate in
“a weak” or “a generic sense”, but not in an absolute lack of lexical meaning.
Doubts concerning the lack of lexical content involve not only ‘semilight’ verbs
but also constructions with standard ‘light’ verbs, such as dar or hacer. From the point
of view of Kearns (2002) and De Miguel (2008), for example, make and hacer are
‘vague’, ‘not very specific’ ‘action’ verbs in make an offer/hacer una oferta, make an
ïœ±ïœ´.â•… The DUE (Moliner, 1970) defines this sense of truncar as “impedir que llegue a
Â�
desarrollarse completamente o a realizarse cierta cosa”.
ïœ±ïœµ.â•… “Hacer que una cosa deje de estar completa o entera o pierda su continuidad” (DUE)
[to make something stop being complete or whole or make it lose its continuity].
ïœ²ïœ°ïœ´	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
inspection/hacer una inspección, and this allows them to combine with different types
of complements. Nevertheless, they preserve the basic meaning “create, bring about
the existence of something”, whether una maqueta ‘a scale model’ or un análisis ‘an
analysis’ (De Miguel 2008:â•›575); then they lexically contribute to the meaning of the
predication. Similarly, expressions like dar un beso [give a kiss], could be considered
as metaphorical extensions of the “primary” meaning of give and dar like verbs of
Â�
‘material transfer’; so they would keep on denoting “an event of giving”, where beso/
kiss is “viewed as an object that is passed from one person to another, as a thing which
may be given to a recipient or a goal” (Kearns 2002:â•›16).
May be the remarks above would suffice to show the vagueness of the “emptying”
concept, but it should be added that some researchers have posited the existence of
‘light’ or ‘support’ verbs with “full meaning”, with “un sémantisme assez fort” (Pontonx
2004:â•›265) or a great semantic “weight’; for example, from the point of view of Pontonx
(2004:â•›265) and Alonso Ramos (2004:â•›64), this would be the case with cometer.
Thus, it seems that the “emptying” of lexical content is, despite its relevance, a
rather vague notion which is difficult to exploit in order to delimit a verb class in a clear
manner. As a matter of fact, most scholars are finally forced to admit that the verb not
only contributes aspectual meaning to the sentence but also adds “something else” (De
Miguel 2006:â•›1299), that it is not “empty”, but “almost empty” or “allegedly empty” of
meaning, although initially they have claimed that the verb is only a grammatical tool
without lexical content. In short, they accept that the verb has a meaning, although this
meaning should be “fairly weak”, “elusive” and “relatively difficult to identify” (Butt y
Geuder 2003:â•›295; Butt 2010:â•›48).
4.2â•… 
On the transmission of arguments
Doubts concerning the “emptying” of the verb might be also extended to the other
key question linked to that property: the transmission of arguments from the noun
to the verb.
If the verb is not totally empty of meaning, if it preserves features of its Â�
primary
sense, if ‘light’ verbs with a great semantic “weight” exist, then it could not be
Â�
self-evident that the verb only facilitates the expression of the noun arguments or that
the noun is the only lexical constituent which can select arguments.
Firstly, leaving aside technical problems specifically related to the process of
transference or borrowing – or any other similar mechanism – of arguments,16 it does
not go unnoticed that studies on ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs give rise to many ques-
tions about the supposition that the verb merely allows the expression of the noun’s
arguments.
ïœ±ïœ¶.â•… See Bosque (2001a: 26), Romero (2007:â•›3), Alonso (2004:â•›233) and Mendívil (1999:â•›89).
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ²ïœ°ïœµ
For example, it is not clear that the subject and the indirect object in Juan le dio un
beso a María come from the noun beso. I also wonder whether the sentence still can be
interpreted “starting from the base transfer construction” (Quochi 2007:â•›32), whether
the verb not only means ‘action’ (Blanco 2000:â•›105) but also imposes the schema of
a transfer event; whether dio has two complements, a direct object and an indirect
object, as is typical of constructions with verbs of transfer. Then it seems more Â�
natural
to admit that the subject is the ‘source’ and the indirect object is the ‘goal’ selected
by dar as a ‘transfer’ verb. Something similar could be said about other ditransitive
Â�constructions with transfer verbs, such as conceder una entrevista or recibir un bofetón.
If recibir is not devoid of meaning in Pepe recibió un bofetón de Juan, but it conveys a
perspective on the transfer – the transfer of the bofetón in this case‒, it would be less
counterintuitive to think that the subject Pepe continues to be understood as the ‘goal’
or ‘recipient’17 of recibir instead of positing that the verb merely links the subject of
recibir and the ‘patient’ or ‘affected’ argument of bofetón, without adding any further
information to the propositional content of the sentence (Alonso Ramos 2004:â•›63). As
regards the sentence El presidente ha concedido una entrevista a un Â�conocido periodista,
el presidente must be interpreted as the ‘agent’, but it does not seem to be true that it
could be identified as the ‘agent’ of entrevista; on the contrary, it would be the ‘agent’ of
conceder and un conocido periodista would be the ‘goal’ or ‘recipient’.
The previous remarks on the meaning of hacer and make also lead us to infer that
constructions with these standard light verbs are not exempt of questions concerning
the function of the verb or the noun in argument selection and the assignment of a
thematic role. For instance, as De Miguel (2008) or Kearns (2002) have suggested,
hacer and make are not totally devoid of lexical meaning in hacer una oferta or make
an argument, but they are vague action verbs which may be interpreted as denoting
the process of ‘making’ or ‘creating’ the referent of the direct object. Thus, there are
no obvious reasons for assuming that the verb does not select a subject with the role
of ‘initiator’ of the creation process, although this initiator may coincide with the
‘agent’ of oferta or argument. So, in the opinion of Kearns, in John and Mary made an
Â�argument the verb not only “theta-marks the action nominal complement” (2002:â•›21)
but also “accentuates” the agency of the subject.
Similarly, if in alimentar una sospecha, cultivar una afición, truncar una relación,
the verb is not totally desemantized, if it preserves features of its primary and more
concrete meaning, why must we think that the thematic role of the subject must come
from the first argument of sospecha, afición or relación instead of admitting that the
verb continues to require an ‘agent’/‘cause’ or ‘initiator’ of the creation process due to
ïœ±ïœ·.â•… In fact, according to Goldberg (1995:â•›
148), for example, in metaphorical extensions
of receive, such as Jo received the information from Sam, the subject is conceptualized as a
Â�
‘recipient’ just as the subject of receive money or receive a present.
ïœ²ïœ°ïœ¶	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
its meaning? María cultiva su amistad con Juan, for example, implies “activity” and
willingness in the subject,18 and these meaning components do not seem to come from
amistad, but from cultivar. Moreover, which thematic role of la amistad de María con
Juan would be transferred to the subject of María cultiva su amistad con Juan?
Secondly, although the argument structure of the noun is a key notion in this
Â�
process, a clear difference between “participants” and “arguments” in a strict sense
(Alonso Ramos 2004:â•›
115) has not been established;19 i.e. on the one hand, between
elements which the verb necessarily “selects” and receives a thematic role from Â�(Quochi
2007:â•›
16) and, on the other hand, between elements that merely are involved in the
‘scene’ or the ‘semantic frame’ or are associated with certain sublexical or Â�
encyclopedic
information (Mendívil 1999:â•›93). In fact, the transmission of arguments from the noun
to the verb has been equally attributed to deverbal nouns that inherit the argument
structure of the verb base, and to ‘eventive’ or ‘abstract’ nouns, like jornada, aventura,
fama, calor which are linked to the complement by means of a relationship of posses-
sion (in a broad sense), but which do not select arguments or assign thematic roles.
Which argument of sueño, calor, fama, balonmano could have been transferred to the
agentive or causative subject of La película me dio sueño, La caminata me dio calor
(Romero, 2007:â•›37), Federico cultiva su fama de mujeriego or Juan practica el balonmano
(Blanco 2000:â•›105)? According to Romero (2007:â•›12), in La caminata me dio calor “the
nominal alone does not allow any kind of argument”; there are two arguments related
to the state of getting hot: the ‘cause’ esa caminata [that walk] and the ‘experiencer’ me
[to me], but none of these arguments seem to come from calor. Therefore, as Romero
points out, “this case would be problematic for an account on transference of arguments
from the noun […] However, it is not problematic for a proposal where the arguments
do no depend directly on either the verb or the noun but rather on the LS resulting from
both elements” (2007:â•›37).
4.3â•… 
About “diagnostic” tests
If the “emptying” of the verb and the transmission of arguments from the noun – as the
semantic head – to the verb do not allow us to delimit the extension of the notions of
‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs in a clear manner, then it is not surprising that the features
related to these characteristics pose doubts.
The existence of ‘inverse’ ‘light’ verbs, the proliferation of verbs to which a light
meaning has been attributed, the fact that a noun can combine with different ‘light’
ïœ±ïœ¸.â•… Bosque (2001a: 27) points out that “some lights verbs seem to be volitional (pay a visit)
while others are not necessarily so (take a chance)” and “it is not clear whether or not this
Â�
difference follows from the lexical properties of the embedded noun”.
ïœ±ïœ¹.â•… In the terms of Quochi (2007:â•›
4), “the noun has been neglected in most approaches,
Â�
although it is the semantic core of the construct”.
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ²ïœ°ïœ·
or ‘semilight’ verbs which add some meaning to the predicate, all leads us to infer,
on the one hand, that we cannot always have a single verb which can replace the
“verb+direct object” construction. Alimentar una sospecha, for example, is not the
same as Â�
sospechar; there is no verb which should be equivalent to recibir un bofetón,
adquirir fama, Â�
truncar una relación or cultivar una afición.
It is true, as Bosque states (2001a: 29), that “semantic equivalence is not required
by the grammar in order to categorize these verbs as (heavier) light verbs”. However,
the previous remarks also lead us to think, on the other hand, that the equivalence
between “full” sentences and nominal phrases without the ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verb
could not be applied to all the constructions with verbs which have been qualified as
‘light’ or ‘semilight’. Obviously, in Pedro recibió un bofetón, Aquello truncó la relación
de Ana con Alberto or La carta alimentó las sospechas de Pedro, the verb cannot be
deleted without losing any information (Pontonx 2004:â•›281): el bofetón de Pedro, la
relación de Ana con Alberto, las sospechas de Pedro.
The reliability of the “deletion test” in order to support the lack of meaning of
Â�
recibir, truncar, alimentar in these sentences, is also minimized by the fact that the
equivalence between nominal phrase and full sentence is not an exclusive feature
of allegedly desemanticized verbs (De Miguel 2008:â•›
568) and so this cannot be an
Â�
argument to support the “emptying” of the verb (Mendívil 1999:â•›
304). According
to De Miguel (2008:â•›
568), a sentence with a verb of ‘creation’, like pintar, componer,
escribir, can be transformed into a nominal phrase whose head is the direct object of
the verb without any loss of information: Picasso pintó el cuadro/el cuadro de Picasso,
Mozart compuso una sonata/la sonata de Mozart, Cervantes escribió la novela/la novela
de Â�Cervantes. In her opinion, this should mean that the equivalence is not due to the
lack of meaning of the verb, but to the information evoked by the noun: the fact that
a picture is “created” by “painting” and a sonata comes into existence by “composing”
should be included in the qualia structure of cuadro, sonata, etc. Also, from the point
of view of Mendívil, the equivalence between the nominal phrase and the full sentence
should prove that there are nouns with a thematic structure, but not necessarily that
the verb is devoid of lexical content (1999:â•›304).
Similarly, restrictions on the nominalization of these verbs do not seem to be
unequivocal proof of the lack of lexical content. On one hand, according to Langer
(2004:â•›
178), there are various exceptions to this criterion, even for expressions that
by other criteria can be judged as prototypical ‘support’ or ‘light’ verb constructions;
dar, for instance, disallows nominalization when used as a full verb in constructions
of material transfer, like Pedro le dio a Juan una entrada; hacer would not accept this
process either when it is used as a ‘creation’ verb: Juan hizo una mesa. On the contrary,
there are phrases like la toma de decisiones, la prise d’une decision (Langer 2004:â•›178)
which come from constructions with the ‘light’ or ‘support’ verbs tomar and prendre.
On the other hand, we have seen, for example, that protagonizar is not an “empty”
verb but, nevertheless, it is unusual as a base of a nominalization when it means that
ïœ²ïœ°ïœ¸	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
a person or a thing is the main figure in something. With regards to adquirir, lanzar,
cultivar, etc. it can be pointed out that De Miguel bases the lack of lexical content of
the verb in adquirir fama, lanzar una acusación, for example, on the oddness of la
adquisición de fama por parte de Juan or el lanzamiento de acusaciones. However the
CREA contains texts where the noun lanzamiento seems to have the “weak” sense
which characterizes this verb when used as a ‘semilight’ verb:
	(88)	
Debido al lanzamiento de ofertas de última hora al que se ha visto obligado
(CREA).
	(89)	
Sirvió de plataforma publicitaria y lanzamiento a los medios de José María
Aznar y la cúpula dirigente (CREA).
	(90)	
Campo Vidal anunció que tras el lanzamiento de esta nueva operación,
Antena 3 se replanteará su presencia en el canal internacional (CREA).
The following texts also contain nominalizations of cultivar and adquirir with the
“weak”, “figurative” sense that these verbs display in uses qualified as ‘semilight’;
Â�
nevertheless, it seems that these sentences seem to be “correct”:
	(91)	 Los especialistas recomiendan el cultivo de aficiones y hobbies.
	(92)	
En la adquisición de buenos o malos modales, más que en ningún otro
Â�
aprendizaje, los principales modelos de los pequeños son sus padres.

Su objetivo es […] es estimular la adquisición de hábitos saludables
Â�
relacionados con la alimentación.
	(94)	
La epistemología es uno de los componentes centrales que permiten
Â�
comprender la adquisición del conocimiento.
The questions which arise from the transmission of arguments also puts “under
Â�
suspicion” the supposition that the constraints on the expression of the subject of
the noun as a possessive determiner or as a complement are due to the mapping of
the arguments of the noun to the “empty” position of the subject (Langer 2004:â•›177).
As Langer pointed out (2005:â•›191), concerning this feature there are, in fact, “many
Â�
evident counterexamples that still need to be explained”. Providing an explanation for
the constraints on the expression of the subject of the eventive noun goes beyond the
scope of this work; however, we can remark at least two things that seem to support
the “weakness” of that criterion.
On the one hand, according to De Miguel (2008:â•›569), restrictions on the Â�“subject”
of the complement do not seem exclusive to constructions with ‘light’ verbs. For
instance, there are similar constraints on the “subjects” of ‘creation’ verbs: in Diego
pintó mi cuadro, Un compañero escribió mi libro, mi cannot be understood as the ‘agent’
who “creates” the picture or the book. Nevertheless, we cannot attribute this Â�restriction
to the lack of meaning of the verb and the subsequent transfer of arguments; on the
contrary, that restriction seems to point towards the semantic properties of the noun.
These properties could indeed explain the oddness of Luis le dio mi explicación a María
(De Miguel 2008:â•›569)(as an equivalent of explicó) or of John made Oddbold’s analysis of
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ²ïœ°ïœ¹
these sentences (Kearns 2002:â•›23): explicación and analysis do not denote a preexisting
object; they allude to objects that are created or developed when the subject “makes” or
“gives” them and, thus, one cannot “dar una explicación” or “make an analysis” “unless
one is the author” (Kearns 2002:â•›23). On the other hand, there are data which confirm
that this restriction on the “subject” of the eventive noun does not always work in
constructions with verbs classified as ‘semilight’. In the examples below, alimentar and
truncar do not exhibit their “primary” or “full” meaning; they have a less specific sense
related to an aspectual meaning; however, the subject of the eventive noun is expressed
by means of a possessive determiner (95–97) or through a nominal complement (98).

Finally, we must pay attention to the ‘double syntactic configuration’ which has been
highlighted as a standard property of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs.
It would be impossible to discuss now the problems related to this “curious”
Â�
property in more detail. As Bosque says (2001a: 24), it has been the topic of debates
which “are not settled” (Bosque 2001a: 24) and has often been explained in a not
“totally convincing” manner (Quochi: 2007:â•›116). Nevertheless, it is pertinent to point
out some questions that reduce its reliability as a distinctive feature of ‘light’ verbs.
First, the status of the complements that allow the double configuration remains
unclear. It would be problematic to explain, for example, why La huida que planearon
del país sounds as odd as La huida que protagonizaron del país, but El viaje que Juan
planeaba a París (Bosque 2001a: 24) does not, when both constructions contain the
same ‘semilight’ verb (planear) and in both cases the complements (del país, a París)
seem to be arguments selected by the noun.
Bosque (2001a: 30) has noted that “the double VP structure requires a strong
Â�
preposition in most cases: contra [against], hacia [towards], por [for] and others”,
although, according to Alonso Ramos (2004:â•›219), this feature is not indispensable. In
fact,theprepositioncontra–ortheequivalentinotherlanguages(against,contre,Â�contro)–
predominates in constructions with protagonizar which accept the double configura-
tion as well as in the examples generally used to illustrate this property: Los diferentes
encierros que el SAT protagonizó contra la crisis, The attack against the Â�
president that they
committed, La campaña que emprendió contra el presidente (Bosque 2001a: 25), La injus-
ticia contra nosotros que se ha cometido (RAE 2009:â•›903), La agresión contra Max que
cometió (Mendívil 1999:â•›161), L’attacco che l’esercito Bosniaco ha sventato contro i nemici
(Quochi 2007:â•›116)… Other common examples also Â�
contain strong Â�
prepositions, like
ïœ²ïœ±ïœ°	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
con (‘with’), sobre (‘about’) or por (‘by’): El enfrentamiento con el Â�
técnico azulgrana que
protagonizó, La discusión que tuvo con su hermano, La investigación sobre el asesinato
que ha realizado, La adoración por su padre que siente/tiene, La admiración que siente
Pedro por María (Giry-Schneider 1991:â•›24; Alonso Ramos 2004).
However, if we re-examine the case of La huida que planearon del país and El
viaje que Juan planeaba a París, it cannot be claimed that de is a ‘weak’ preposition in
la huida del país, where it is related to the thematic role of ‘source’ or ‘origin’, but a is
a ‘strong’ preposition in el viaje a París,20 where it is associated with the thematic role
of ‘goal’ or ‘direction’.
Secondly,notalltheexamplesusedtoillustratethispropertyseemtobeacceptable.
Constructions like dar un beso, hacer caricias are usually cited as examples
in Â�
studies on Spanish ‘light’ verbs, but whereas El beso que le dio Juan a María, Las
Â�
caricias que le hace Pedro a María, Los consejos que da Roberto a Rocío (Blanco 2000;
Herrero Ingelmo 2000), do not seem like odd expressions, there should be some doubt
about the acceptability of El beso a María que Juan dio, Las caricias a María que hace
Pedro or Los consejos a Rocío que da Alberto. The same could be said about El apoyo
al Â�
técnico que dio, La explicación a las autoridades que dio, La atención al detalle que
prestó, El bofetón a Pedro que dio when compared with El apoyo que le dio al técnico, Las
Â�
explicaciones que dio a las autoridades, La atención que prestó al detalle or El bofetón
que le dio a Pedro. Furthermore, it is also doubtful that La sanción que impuso a Xavi
el técnico means the same as La sanción a Xavi que impuso el técnico (Koike 2001:â•›90).
So, on the grounds of these examples, it would be difficult to admit that a María, al
técnico, a las autoridades, a Xavi are complements ‘legitimated’ by the noun in El beso
que le dio Juan a María etc. It seems more logical to think that they express the ‘goal’
or Â�
‘recipient’ of a ‘transfer’ verb with the meaning “the subject causes something to go
from a source to a goal or recipient”.
Thirdly, ‘light’ verbs are not the only ones which allow the double Â�
configuration.
‘Creation’ verbs also display this property (Bosque 2001a: 24; RAE 2009:â•›
903). As
Bosque highlights, El asalto contra la fortaleza que inició el ejército and El asalto que
inició el ejército contra la fortaleza are correct expressions and contain “a standard
representative of aspectually inceptive verbs” (Bosque 2001a: 24). On the contrary, El
asalto que terminó el ejército contra la fortaleza is an odd expresión. “Full” ‘creation’
verbs like escribir or idear also seem to accept the double construction: El libro sobre
Irak que escribió, El libro que escribió sobre Irak (Mendívil 1999:â•›111), El aparato contra
los mosquitos que ideó, El aparato que ideó contra los mosquitos. Furthermore, it has
been claimed that ‘creation’ verbs and ‘light’ verbs behave in the same manner because
they share certain semantic properties; according to Bosque (2001a: 24), for example,
ïœ²ïœ°.â•… Alonso Ramos uses the phrase el viaje a París to support the idea that the preposition in
this type of constructions is not always a ‘strong’ preposition.
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ²ïœ±ïœ±
‘light’ verbs “denote in various ways the coming into existence of an event or a state
of affairs”. Also, in the terms of Gaatone (2004:â•›241), “le NPRED renvoie à ce qu’on
appelait traditionnellement l’object “effectué”, c’est-à-dire à une entité non affectée par
le procès verbal, mais désignant elle-même ce procès”.
However, on the one hand, it is obvious that not all the verbs which have been
qualified as ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ are similar to ‘creation’ verbs. In truncar una relación,
concluir un mandato (Blanco & Buvet 2004:â•›33) or alimentar una sospecha, the verbs do
not seem to share meaning components with ‘creation’ verbs; truncar and concluir have
a ‘resultative’ or ‘terminative’ meaning, and alimentar una sospecha involves a “preexis-
tent” suspicion; nevertheless, all of these verbs allow the double analysis; las sospechas
contra su socio que alimentaba Juan, las sospechas que Juan alimentaba contra su socio.
On the other hand, ‘creation’ verbs and ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verbs are not the only
ones which allow these constructions.
As seen before, the behavior of protagonizar, for example, as regards the double
structure cannot be explained by arguing that it is a ‘light’ verb, but it is not a verb of
‘creation’ either. Nouns combining with protagonizar denote entities that have been
created by means of an activity, and this feature is part of their qualia structure, their
‘semantic frame’ or the encyclopedic information associated to them. However, while
‘creation’ verbs like idear, componer, construir, escribir or crear, encode an activity
which causes the coming into being of the direct object, protagonizar does not profile
an action which creates a new entity. Ariadna protagonizó el monólogo or Los primates
protagonizan numerosos proyectos de investigación do not mean that Ariadna and los
primates create the monólogo or the proyectos de investigación; they are only entities
which “participate” in some way in the event denoted by the direct object and have
an important role in it. Capitanear [captain] and liderar [lead] are not ‘creation’ verbs
either; they denote “prominence” or “domain” and establish a locative relationship
between the subject and the direct object, just as protagonizar does; nevertheless, they
allow the double configuration: La campaña contra la droga que lideró/la compaña que
lideró contra la droga, La manifestación contra la rebaja de sueldos que capitaneó/La
manifestación que capitaneó contra la rebaja de sueldos.
It is also far from clear that Las pruebas contra X que presentó, La admiración por
los intelectuales que Pedro declara (Alonso Ramos 2004:â•›
220) or La expedición que
organizó nuestro equipo al Himalaya contain a ‘light’ or ‘semilight verb, though these
phrases may be transformed into Las pruebas que presentó contra X, La admiración
que Pedro declara por los intelectuales and La expedición al Himalaya que organizó
nuestro equipo. Bosque (2001a: 25) claims that organizar, for example, is a ‘semilight’
verb due to the fact that it accepts the double structure; nevertheless, from the point of
view of Alonso Ramos (2004:â•›220), this construction is a ‘collocation’ but not a ‘light’
or Â�
‘support’ verb construction because the verb is not empty of lexical content. On
the contrary, in her opinion, this construction could give support to the idea that the
double configuration does not only work with ‘light’ or ‘support’ verbs.
ïœ²ïœ±ïœ²	 María Antonia Martínez Linares
Thus, it appears that the properties which allow or disallow the double Â�
syntactic
configuration remain unexplained and, so, this syntactic feature does not entirely
prove that a construction contains a ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verb.
AsDeMiguel(2008)orMendívil(1999),amongothers,suggest,maybethisÂ�syntactic
behavior and the rest of the characteristics attributed to ‘semilight’ verbs are not due to
the “emptying” of the verb and the subsequent transmission of arguments. Perhaps they
depend to the same extent on semantics of the particular arguments as they do on the
base meaning of the verb itself (Romero 2007:â•›29; De Miguel 2008:â•›576) and, therefore,
should be explained on the grounds of the usual co-composition from the constituents of
the predication (Erbach & Kreen 1993:â•›3), without needing “a special mechanism such as
argument transference or argument substitution” (Romero 2007:â•›44).
5.â•… Concluding remarks
As stated at the beginning of this work, the first sections of the study have been devoted
to the analysis of sentences with protagonizar using properties attributed to ‘light’ or
‘semilight’ verbs as a base.
The aim of the analysis was to verify if constructions with protagonizar display
the features of constructions with ‘semilight’ verbs, that is, with verbs that are not
‘standard’ light verbs like hacer, dar, tomar, but that, due to their characteristics, are
considered as an extension of these verbs.
The subject matter arose from a previous work which analyzed certain aspects
of protagonizar and other denominal verbs that have been classified as ‘agentive’ or
‘similative’ in semantic classifications of verbs formed with the suffix -izar. This work
showed that, unlike other ‘agentive’ or ‘similative’ verbs, protagonizar does not always
fit the semantic and grammatical characteristics of these verbs when it means “a Â�
person
or a thing is the main figure of something”. However, the analysis also Â�
suggested
that Â�
protagonizar seems to have some similarities with ‘semilight’ verbs: the usual
Â�
combination with eventive nouns, a certain “emptying” of lexical content, the semantic
“weight” of the Â�
complement, the relative oddness of its nominalization, and the double
configuration which can be seen, for example, in El vigésimo error que protagoniza el
Madrid en la defensa and El vigésimo error en defensa que protagoniza el Madrid.
This paper confirms that these properties are true; nevertheless, this work has also
shown that if we analyze the properties of these verbs in more detail and put them in a
broad sample of sentences with protagonizar and an ‘eventive’ noun as a direct object,
we ought to conclude that protagonizar is not actually a ‘semilight’ verb, despite its
similarities with this class of verbs.
It combines with eventive nouns which have a great semantic weight and does
not semantically select its subject; the semantic properties of the noun influence the
reading of the sentences and the subject must be understood as a participant of the
	On protagonizar ‘an event’ and the scope of the concept of ‘light verb’	 ïœ²ïœ±ïœ³
event denoted by the noun. However, sentences with protagonizar do not always fit
the canonical features of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs, nor is the verb totally deprived
of lexical content. It preserves its basic meaning and tends to form collocations with
eventive nouns due to that basic meaning. Thus, the characteristics of the sentences
with protagonizar would be explained on the grounds of the basic meaning of the verb,
the semantic, sublexical, encyclopedic or ‘frame’ properties of the noun which the verb
takes as a direct object, and the interaction of both elements.
Nevertheless, the review of the features of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs have led us
to question whether these features really allow us to think of lanzar, cultivar, adquirir,
organizar, planear, alimentar as a special class of verbs which extend the category of
‘light’ verbs.
It has been highlighted that the concepts which support the notion of ‘light’ verb –
such as the “emptying” of lexical content and the alleged transfer of arguments from the
noun to the verb – display their vagueness when extended beyond prototypical ‘light’
verbs. We have seen too that constructions with verbs classified as ‘semilight’ do not fit
all the tests commonly applied to assess the condition of ‘light’ or ‘semilight’ verb, and,
as Quochi (2007:â•›3) claims, “this supports the idea of ‘semilight’ verb as a vague notion”.
Finally, we could also realize that most of the tests that cover the attributes of these
constructions – for example, the double syntactic configuration – give rise to questions
and seem to require an explanation with respect to the underlying properties of the
construction which can really be considered the base for the tests, although, as Langer
says, (2004:â•›183), “taken as a whole, the test battery seems to be suitable to distinguish
support verb constructions from superficially similar linguistic expressions”, such as
idiomatic expressions.
In short, if we cannot claim that protagonizar sentences are constructions with
a Â�
‘semilight’ verb, it also does not seem, as Romero (2007) or De Miguel (2008)
have Â�
suggested, that lanzar, alimentar, adquiri, organizar, etc. can be considered as
a Â�
special subclass of verbs. On the contrary, they seem to be just like other verbs
and the Â�
properties of the constructions with these verbs would also be explained
on the grounds of pervasive phenomena in natural languages: polisemy Â�
involving
Â�underspecification which “enables us to analyze all verbs as ‘light’ to a certain extent”21
(Pustejovsky 1998:â•›330), semantic selection, co-composition…
May be the properties of ‘light’ and ‘semilight’ verbs are not only based on elusive
notions but have also been applied to many different classes of verbs and, as Gaatone
(2004:â•›250) suggests, “one may suspect that the reason for the proliferation of the class
lies mainly in the vagueness of the criteria chosen for deciding which verb may be
considered as a support verb”.
ïœ²ïœ±.â•… According to Pustejovsky (1998:â•›327) “the syntactic and semantic behavior of light verb
is another kind of underspecification”.

The relationship between verb-noun
in derivational series
Jesús Pena
University of Santiago de Compostela
The aim of this chapter is to study the relationship between verbs and deverbal
nouns within the derivational series and sub-series which constitute a word
family. Specifically, it explores, from a historical point of view, some of the
changes that Spanish deverbal nouns have undergone inside derivational series
with regard to their original base verb. In doing so, this article proves that
morphological irregularities can only be detected from a diachronic perspective.
Keywords:â•‡ word family; derivational series; morphological change; deverbal noun
1.â•… Introduction
The subject I am going to examine in this paper is the relationship between verbs
and nouns in the derivational sequence verb → deverbal noun, such as agrupar →
Â�agrupamiento (to group → grouping). This is an unmarked sequence, as is clear in
the transparency of the label ‘deverbal noun’, as opposed to the label ‘denominal verb’
which represents the inverse derivational sequence (grupo → agrupar [group → to
group]). Consequently, in a series like grupo → agrupar → agrupamiento, the section
to study is that of agrupar-agrupamiento and only indirectly that of grupo-agrupar. The
aim of this analysis is to describe the alterations the deverbal noun undergoes in the
different derivational series and subseries in the heart of a word family.
The choice of this subject, closely related to the issue of verbal derivation, is
Â�
motivated by a research project1 aiming to create a database for the NDHE (Nuevo
Â�
Diccionario Histórico de la Lengua Española) from the R.A.E. (Real Academia
Â�Española) and which actually implies adapting a previous morphological database that
I Â�
personally created many years ago.2
ïœ±.â•… Research Project FFI2008–03532.
ïœ².â•… In the works by Pena and Campos Souto (2009) and Campos Souto (2007) we can find
quite detailed information on the objectives and functions of this database in the NDHE.
ïœ²ïœ±ïœ¸	 Jesús Pena
The database is built on two languages, Latin and Spanish. Although it was not
initially conceived as a historical database for the Spanish language, the diachronic
approach is easy to recover thanks to the privileged attention paid to the Latin Â�language.
At present, one of the main tasks carried out by the participants in the project consists
in grouping together words in families and, within each family, in derivational series
and subseries. Let us use as a sample a fragment of the Latin and Spanish families
Â�
corresponding to the verbs facere and hacer.3

Of the data gathered in (1), I would like to draw attention to the concordances and
Â�
discordances existing between Latin and Spanish derivational series. So, in the
Â�formation of deverbal nouns and adjectives from facere the Latin series exemplified are
preserved in Spanish and are expanded by new formations. However, in the formation
of deverbal verbs by prefixation, we encounter gaps in the Spanish series, specifically
in the second link, since none of the three prefixed Latin verbs – afficere, conficere,
perficere – continue in Spanish.
The absence of these verbs somehow affects the rest of the members of each series.
Bywayofanexample,intheseriesfacereperficere[tocarryout,todoinacompleteman-
ner, to perfect] which appears at the end of (1), the absence of the Latin verb Â�
perficere
is recovered in Spanish by the creation of perfeccionar [to perfect] built on the noun
perfección [perfection], but with consequential readjustments: the Â�
originally dever-
bal noun, perfección, has now become the derivational base of the verb Â�
perfeccionar.
Semantically, however, perfección becomes the quality noun that Â�
corresponds to the
adjective perfecto, -a [perfect], while a new deverbal noun is created for perfeccionar,
which is perfeccionamiento [perfecting].
The gap in the series facere, perficere, etc. is found in the second link. But the gap
can appear in any phase in the derivational series, and it often occurs in the first link or
starting point of the series, and even in the first two links, as shown in (2).

ïœ²ïœ²ïœ°	 Jesús Pena
Before going on to examine the derivational relations in more detail, I believe it is
necessary to make two previous considerations relating to lexical morphology as a
categorizer of lexical meanings and to derivational series and subseries (cf. Coseriu
1978; Corbin 1987; Croft 1991, among others).
Firstly, within the derivational morphology of these languages there is an
Â�organized lexical pattern, which is vital for its categorization: derivational Â�morphology
classifies roots in so-called word classes. Spanish, like other languages of the same
morphological type, codifies roots of lexical meaning categorising them in so-called
word classes. If we stick to the three lexical classes (noun, adjective and verb), any
root can be categorized under one of the three. So, if a root is originally adjectival, it is
Â�primarily categorized as an adjective and secondly as a verb and a noun (duro → endu-
recer and dureza [hard → to harden and hardness]); if it is originally nominal, it is pri-
marily categorized as a noun and secondly as an adjective and a verb (centro → central
and centrar [centre → central and to centre]); if it is originally verbal it is categorized
Â�
primarily as a verb and secondly as a noun and an adjective (crecer → crecimiento and
creciente [to grow → growth and growing]). As we can see, it is precisely in secondary
categorization where derivational morphology is involved.
Secondly, word formation rules (WFR) do not end their role in this first
Â�
derivational phase or cycle. Any of the three lexical categories categorized in the
first phase can be re-categorized or sub-categorized in consecutive phases. By
way of an example, the series centro → central, centrar develops other series such as
those in (3).
	 (3)	centro → céntrico, -a, → excéntrico, -a → excentricidad
		centro → central → centralidad, centralismo, centralista
		centro → central → centralizar → centralización, centralizador
		centro → central → centralizar → descentralizar, descentralización
		centro → centrar → concentrar → concentración
		…
It is precisely within the field of the word family above broken down into its various
derivational series, and from a genetic point of view, that I will study the section of the
derivational series verb → deverbal noun in order to observe the changes that have
occurred in this V → N pattern: gaps, new formations, readjustments; in short, any
alteration affecting the deverbal noun as regards the original base verb.
Within this framework I will describe some of the situations of change and
Â�
readjustment seen in the history of Spanish. Firstly, I will examine the situations of
readjustment without bearing in mind the creations made in Spanish (§2); secondly,
I will study them, also observing these Romance creations (§3).
Initially, the unmarked situation, and most expected, is the one in which both
members of the series remain in Spanish in the original order verb → deverbal noun,
also preserving the derivational relation between them, as shown in (4).

2.â•… 
Readjustment situations not including Romance creations
Using the table offered in (4) as a starting point, I am going to specify some situations
of change and readjustment that have occurred in Spanish. As I have just indicated,
I will not bear in mind Romance creations in this section.
2.1â•… 
The base verb remains beside the deverbal noun, but there is no
morphological relation between them
When contrasting the Spanish derivational series with the Latin one what may occur
is, as shown in (5), that the Latin verb and deverbal noun are present in the Spanish
language, but the deverbal noun no longer bears relation to the base verb.
	(5)	
latin	 spanish
		cadere	cāsus	 caer	 caso
		 implēre	implēmentum	 henchir	 implemento
		 miscēre	mixtūra	 mecer	 mixtura
In (5) there is a formal and semantic difference between the base verb and the derived
noun. From a formal point of view, while the verb represents a direct continuation
from Latin to Spanish and follows the phonetic evolutions typical of the language,
the noun in question, as a learned word, implies an incorporation into Spanish in a
moment of the language when the phonetic rules that affected the simple verb were
no longer used.
2.2â•… 
The verbal noun remains isolated by not continuing the Latin base verb
It is a well-known fact that many of the base verbs of Latin deverbal nouns do not
continue in Spanish. Of the group of verbs that compose the four Latin conjugations
(present stems in -ā-, -ē-, -i-, and consonant stems), only verbs from the first conjuga-
tion (-ā- stems) are preserved quite regularly, while verbs from other conjugations
tend to disappear (cf. Pena 1980: 36-37). The result of this process is that in Spanish
the Latin derivational series remains truncated: the deverbal nouns that do continue

remain isolated when the corresponding Latin base verb disappears. There is a gap in
the derivational series. This occurs in the examples in (6).

The deverbal noun appears associated to another verb as a result
of the crossing of two Latin derivational series
The Latin suffixing system tends to develop denominal verbs, but it also makes for
the formation of deverbal verbs, though much less frequently. One of the processes
involves using, as a base for the derivation, the stem of the perfect passive participle of
primary verbs and forming a new verb by directly adding the vowel from the verb stem
in -ā-: cane-re, part. can-t-u-s, -a, -u-m > can-t-ā-re, curr-e-re, part. cur-s-u-s, -a, -u-m
> cur-s-ā-re. These deverbal verbs indicate a certain aspectuality, normally Â�
iterative
(dīcere [to say] → dictāre [to say repeatedly, to dictate], currere [to run] → cursāre
[to run around]), occasionally habitual or frequentative (īre [to go] → itāre [to usually
go, to go often]).
This way, Latin has, in this case, two derivational series in which each Â�
verb –
the base verb and the derived verb – have, in principle, their corresponding deverbal
nouns, as can be seen in (7).
	 (7)	canere →	 cantio cantus cantor
		 ↓
		cantāre →	 cantātio cantāmen cantātus cantātor
The interweaving I am referring to in this section occurs between these two Latin
Â�
derivational series (cf. Pena 1976: 20-24; Pena 1980: 50-51). Let us see the examples in
(8), where both series are shown in parallel, the one for the base verb and the one for
the deverbal verb, and they are Â�
contrasted with the present situation in Spanish.
We can see that in both Latin derivational series each verb – base verb and derived
verb – almost always have their corresponding deverbal nouns. In Spanish, however,
the situation is varied and complex. Let us first examine the two situations exemplified
in (8a) and (8b).
	(8a)	 latin	 spanish
		dīcere	 dictio	 decir	 dicción
		 dictāre	 dictāmen dictātus dictātūra	 dictar	 dictamen dictado
						 dictadura
		 (con)uertere	conuersio	 convertir	conversión
		 conuersāre	 conuersātio	 conversar	conversación
	 The relationship between verb-noun in derivational series 	 ïœ²ïœ²ïœ³
	(8b)	 (ac)cipere	 acceptio	 –	 acepción
		acceptāre	 acceptātio	aceptar	aceptación
		 (dis)serere	dissertio	 –	 –
		 dissertāre	 dissertātio	disertar	disertación
In (8a) both series are kept separate. However, that is not normally the case; Â�
usually,
only one of the series continues, normally that of the derived verb (8b). Up to this
point, the situation is, more or less, what can be expected and can be considered
Â�
conservative, in the sense that in each series that continues in Spanish the order of
derivation is respected, each verb keeping its corresponding deverbal noun(s).
But the situation changes drastically in (8c): already in Latin we can see that, while
the base verb always has its deverbal nouns, this is not the case with the derived verb: in
some case it does exist (cantātio, insultātio), but in others it does not. So, what Â�
happens
in Â�
Spanish? As we can see, of the two Latin verbs, the one that continues is the derived
verb. Nevertheless, of deverbal nouns, those that continue are precisely the nouns
Â�
corresponding to the base verb. This leads to a new relation in Spanish, which is the result
of associating the deverbal noun, which originally corresponds to the base verb, with the
verb from the other series, which is originally the deverbal verb ending in -tāre or -sāre.
	(8c)	 latin	 spanish
		 canere	 cantio cantus cantor	 –	 canción canto cantor
		 cantāre	 cantātioâ•…cantāmen	cantar	 –	 –
		(in)ficere	 infectio	 –	 infección

		insultāre	 insultātio	 insultar	 –
		(in)iicere	 iniectio	 –	 inyección

		confessāre		 confesar
		(re)spicere	 respectus	 –	 respeto
		respectāre		 respetar
		uomere	 uomitus	 –	 vómito
		uomitāre		 vomitar
As we can see in (8d), the dislocation and consequent readjustment in Spanish which
occurs when both Latin derivational series converge into one, contrasts with the new
Hispanic creations, which attach in a regular fashion to the Spanish verb with the
stem in -a-: cantar → cantador, cantante, cantable [to sing → singer, singer, Â�
singable],
Â�insultar → insultante, insultador [to insult → insulting, insulting], inyectar →
Â�
inyectador, inyectable [to inject → injector, injectable], etc. That way, double formations
coexist, such as cantor ~ cantador or inyector ~ inyectador. Also, if we contrast the
Â�
segmentation of Latin deverbal nouns that continue in Spanish with those created in
ïœ²ïœ²ïœ´	 Jesús Pena
Spanish we can see that new affixed irregular variants appear alongside the Â�regular and
Â�productive variants: -ión (cantar/canción [to sing/song], confesar/confesión [to confess/
confession]) ~ -ción (animar/animación [to animate/animation]), -or (cantar/cantor
[to sing/singer], confesar/confesor [to confess/confessor]) ~ -dor (cantar/cantador [to
sing/singer]), -ivo (vomitar/vomitivo [to be sick/sickening]) ~ -tivo (afirmar/afirmativo
[to affirm/affirmative]), etc.

		 respetar	 respeto	 respetable, respetador

2.4â•… 
The isolated deverbal noun begins to relate with a different
class from the verb
Latin deverbal nouns, which in Spanish are isolated in the derivational series due to
loss of the base verb, can begin to be related with a different class from the verb: with a
noun or an adjective. This new relation occurs preferably when the Latin Â�deverbal noun
uses a denominal or deadjectival derived verb as its base, and is thereforeÂ�Â�
integrated in
ternary series, such as those in (9).
	(9)	
latin	 spanish
		 arcus	 arcuāre	 arcuātio	 arco	 –	arcuación
		 corpus	 corporāre	 corporātio	 cuerpo	–	corporación
		 dens	 dentīre	 dentītio	 diente	 –	dentición
		 inānis	 inānīre	 inānītio	 inane	 –	inanición
Sometimes, the gap in the derivational series can be that of the derived verb, in which
case the deverbal noun that continues becomes formally associated with the base
noun or adjective from the disappeared Latin verb; semantically it can preserve the
action or eventive meaning, so it presupposes the meaning of the disappeared verb.
Such is the case of inanición [starvation] in contexts such as La evidencia de una lenta
inanición [Proof of a slow starvation]. This is also the case of dentición, though here
both Â�
readings, eventive [teething] and denominal [set of teeth], alternate, e.g.: Muchos
niños pierden el apetito durante la dentición [Many children lose their appetite during
teething] as opposed to La dentición del perro consta de 24 piezas [The dog’s set of teeth
is made up of 24 teeth].4
ïœ´.â•… For examples in context, I have referred to the following dictionaries: SALAMANCA,
CLAVE, DEA and DUE. In some, very rare, cases I have had to resort to the CREA.

2.5â•… 
Deverbal nouns with a deadjectival reading
The cases of readjustment in deverbal nouns described in previous sections respond
basically to the absence of the base verb of those nouns in the series inherited by
Â�
Spanish, present in the original Latin derivational series. The situation I am now going
to describe shows us originally deverbal nouns that still preserve the derivational base
verb alongside them, as well as the eventive value typical of deverbal nouns. In this
sense, the derivational series does not present anomalies insofar as both members of
the series are present, and in the expected derivational order: verb → deverbal noun.
However, it appears that these deverbal nouns can be enabled to act also as nouns of
quality (cf. Pena 2005).
We know that deadjectival nouns constitute a main or prototypical category
of nouns of quality: bondad [goodness], as a noun, indicates the corresponding
quality of bueno [good], as an adjective. But, together with deadjectival nouns, there is
a second morphological type of nouns of quality which is formed by deverbal nouns
enabled as deadjectival nouns. In this case, these deadjectival nouns are associated
with the past participle of a verb converted to the adjective lexical category which, as
adjective, designates a permanent or temporary property.
Let us consider a verb such as moderar [to moderate]. By means of suffixation with
-ción the noun moderación [moderation] has been created with the meaning of ‘action
of V’ (moderar la velocidad, el debate → la moderación de la velocidad, del debate [to
reduce speed, to moderate the debate → the reduction of speed, the Â�
moderation of
the debate]). This situation is normal; but as it turns out, moderado, -a [moderate], as
well as being the inflectional form of the participle, is also an adjective meaning ‘not
Â�exaggerated, calm’ and, as this adjective, it does not have the corresponding Â�deadjectival
noun, like moderadez [moderaty] (e.g.: dejado, -a → dejadez [slovenly → slovenliness])
or moderadía [moderacy] (e.g.: osado → osadía [daring → daring]).
This gap is filled by the deverbal noun ending in -ción, moderación with a Â�
second
meaning, that of the ‘quality of someone that is moderate’: es moderado en la comida,
en sus intervenciones → tiene moderación en la comida, en sus intervenciones [he is
moderate when eating, in his interventions → he has moderation when eating, in his
interventions]. Another example: decisión (decision) ‘action of V’ (decide retirarse →
la decisión de retirarse [he decides to retire → the decision to retire]), and ‘attitude of
Â�someone decidido [determined]’: es muy decidido → tiene mucha decisión [he is very
determined → he has a lot of determination].
Only rarely do adjectives derived from participles have deadjectival nouns:
(dejar) dejado, -a → dejadez (as opposed to dejación), (desenvolver) desenvuelto, -a
→ Â�
desenvoltura [to cope, confident → confidence] (as opposed to desenvolvimiento),
(fluir) fluido, -a → fluidez [to flow, fluid → fluidity], (honrar) honrado, -a → honradez
[to honour, honest → honesty], (osar) osado, -a → osadía [to dare, daring → daring]
and few more. Normally, this lacking is covered by the corresponding deverbal noun,
ïœ²ïœ²ïœ¶	 Jesús Pena
which can have both Â�
readings, deverbal and deadjectival, or, less frequently, only a
Â�
deadjectival Â�
reading. Let us look at the examples in (10).
	(10)	 verb	 adjective	 noun
		 abstraer	 abstraído, -a	 abstracción
		 confiar	 confiado, -a	 confianza
		 encoger	 encogido, -a	 encogimiento
		 moderar	 moderado, -a	 moderación
The nouns in (10) can have a deverbal reading (for example, confío en que todo se
Â�solucione → mi confianza en que todo se solucione [I trust everything will sort itself
out → my trust in everything sorting itself out]) or deadjectival (for example, es muy
Â�confiado → tiene mucha confianza [he is very trusting → he has a lot of trust]). This
enabling or transferring of the deverbal noun to indicate ‘quality’ or ‘state’ has its
Â�
precedents in Latin series also originally ternary like those in (11a), but in today's
Spanish appear only as binary series with an adjective and a noun (11b) since the
Â�
disappearance of the original Latin base verb.
	(11a)	 verb	 perf.partic.	 noun
		 concīdere ‘to cut 	 concīsus, -a, -um	 concīsio
		 something into pieces’
		 cauēre ‘to take care’	 cautus, -a, -um	 cautio
		 ciscumspicere	 circumspectus, -a, -um	 circumspectio
		 ‘to glance around’
	(11b)	 adjective	 noun
		 conciso, -a	 concisión
		 cauto, -a	 caución
		 circunspecto, -a	 circunspección
What today are deadjectival nouns and adjectives like the ones we have just listed in
(11b) were originally participle forms of the verb and deverbal nouns respectively, as
we can see in (11a).

Readjustment situations including Romance creations
Up to this point I have described situations of change and readjustment without
Â�
considering creations added during the history of the Spanish language. I will now
go on to study readjustments also bearing in mind Hispanic creations within each
derivational series.
3.1â•… 
The Latin deverbal noun, base of the Spanish derived verb
In most cases, the situation of isolation in which the originally deverbal noun is left,
due to the disappearance of the original Latin base verb, is temporary because Spanish
	 The relationship between verb-noun in derivational series 	 ïœ²ïœ²ïœ·
tends to morphologically re-codify as a verb the lexical meaning carried by the noun
using one of the processes available in the relevant period in history. One of these
processes is the following: a lot of deverbal nouns, which have been isolated since the
Latin base verb did not continue in Spanish, have acted in Spanish as derivational
bases of a new verb with -a- stem (cf. Pena 1976: 180-186; Pena 1980:â•›54).

		 sancīre	 sanctio	 –	sanción	 sancionar
Ifthenormaldirectioninthederivationalseriesisverb→deverbalnoun,herewefindthat
the direction is the opposite: the originally deverbal noun is the base of the derived verb.
We must observe that in many cases the originally deverbal noun Â�
preserves the eventive
reading which can be paraphrased as the ‘action of V’, only now the Â�
corresponding verb is
derived, not the base for derivation (cf. Pena 1980; Soares Rodrigues 2001). Consequently,
there is a Â�
discordance or asymmetry between the formal aspect and the semantic aspect
as regards the direction of the derivational relation of these verb-noun pairs: in the Â�formal
Â�
relation, the direction is noun → verb (gestión → gestionar [management → to Â�
manage],
ingreso → ingresar [payment → to pay], custodia → custodiar [custody → to guard]); in
the semantic relation it is the opposite, verb → noun: gestión, ingreso and custodia can be
paraphrased as the ‘action of’ gestionar, ingresar and custodiar, respectively.
ïœ²ïœ²ïœ¸	 Jesús Pena
The formation in Spanish of a verb upon a deverbal noun can be produced even
when the Latin base verb of the noun continues and, therefore, the Latin derivational
pattern is kept. What I would like to underline in this case is the inverse derivational
order with respect to the normal order, namely action noun → derived verb, as in
figure (13).
	(13)	 latin	 spanish
		v	 s	 v	 s	 v
		-ā- stem
		dictāre	 dictāmen	dictar	 dictamen	 dictaminar
		fricāre	 frictio	 fregar	 fricción	 friccionar

		 committere	 commissio	cometer	 comisión	 comisionar
		 (ex)pandere	 expansio	 expandir	expansión	 expansionar
		 imprimere	 impressio	 imprimir	impresión	 impresionar
		quaerere	 quaestio	 querer	 cuestión	 cuestionar	 -miento
		rādere	 rāsūra	 raer	 rasura	 rasurar	 -ción
		-i- stem
		capere	 captūra	 caber	 captura	 capturar
		facere	 factūra	 hacer	 factura	 facturar	 -ción
		-ī- stem
		condīre	 condīmentum	 condir	 condimento

		metīrī	 mensūra	 medir	 mesura	 mesurar
		(trans)īre	 transitus	 transir	 tránsito	 transitar
		 (sub)uenīre	 subuentio	subvenir	 subvención	subvencionar
The presence of this second verb responds basically to factors of a semantic nature,
and often also of a formal kind. The more the primary verb and the deverbal noun
gradually lose their semantic relation, the greater the probability of creating a second
verb to codify under that category the meaning of the noun. The extreme situation
appears when the speaker no longer perceives a derivational relation (nor formal nor
semantic) between the original verb and the deverbal noun. In this case, the first verb
	 The relationship between verb-noun in derivational series 	ïœ²ïœ²ïœ¹
seeks a new place in the derivational series by associating with another deverbal noun,
normally one of Romance creation. Such is the case of the examples in (14).

		caber	 captura	 capturar

		querer →	querencia
		raer	 rasura	 rasurar

		tundir	 tonsura	 tonsurar

In order to complete this study, I would like to go back to a situation examined in § 2.5.
Inthissection,IreferredtofaultyadjectiveandnounseriescausedbytheÂ�disappearance
of the original Latin base verb. They are exemplified in (11b): Â�conciso concisión Â�[concise

circumspection] and let us add concreto concreción [concrete concretion], obseso
obsesión [obsessed obsession], etc. These binary series can become ternary when the
verbal category is recovered by creating a new verb from one of the members of this
binary series: the adjective or the noun.
In (15a), the nouns obsesión [obsession], perfección [perfection] and convulsión
[convulsion] have been the derivational bases of obsesionar [to obsess], perfeccionar

4.â•… Conclusion
In this paper I have examined the readjustment situations brought about in verb →
deverbal noun derivational series, within the framework of word families. I have taken
into account reorganizations created in the diachronic past of Spanish on two levels:
one reached without the inclusion of new Romance formations and one obtained by
adding Romance creations.
Most of the irregularities existing in the lexical morphology of Romance languages
are a consequence of the fact that these languages are historical, in the sense used by
Coseriu (1978). Therefore, these morphological irregularities can only be detected from
a Â�
historical point of view. All through this paper I believe I have shown that the appro-
priate frame for discovering many of the situations of change and readjustment is that
of word family, broken down in their different derivational series and subseries.

Nominalizations of transfer verbs
Blocking, constraints and competition
between affixes*
Antonio Rifón Sánchez
University of Vigo
This chapter analyzes the nominalization of sixty-two transfer verbs concerning
three morphological processes: conversion, suffixation using -ción, and suffixation
using -miento. The competition between these mechanisms results in a process
of differentiation, which can be carried out by means of a semantic change, a
diatopic difference, or through the disappearance of one of them. In this scenario,
two elements are fundamental: time and frequency. The former is needed either
for the displacement or disappearance of one of the derived nouns; the latter
affects both the strength and the resistance exhibited by the concerned derived
elements. This process is linked to the productivity of the derived elements
not only as types, but also as derivational models, which is in turn reflected in
morphological organization.
Keywords:â•‡ nominalization; transfer verbs; conversion; suffixation
1.â•… Introduction
Nominalizations have been and are a truly prolific field of study and, no doubt,
Â�
Chomsky’s article from 1970 has contributed to this fact. If I may generalise and
summarise, what prevails in studies on nominalizations is the analysis of inheritance
and argument structure (i.e. Grimshaw 1990; Querol Bataller 2008, etc.) or aspectual
inheritance (i.e. Brinton 1995, Huyghe & Marin 2007, etc.). However, this study does
not discuss either of these two aspects, but focuses on the morphological competition
in the formation of deverbal nouns from transfer verbs.

By transfer verbs, as defined in the ADESSE,1 we mean those verbs in which
An entity (A2) changes its owner or user such that it develops a Â�
Possession-
possessed or Part-whole relation with another entity (A1) different from the
original (A0).
Using the transfer verbs listed in the ADESSE, we have extracted tokens of all their
nouns derived through conversion2 or suffixation using the particles -miento and -ción
from the CORDE (Diachronic corpus of Spanish) and the CREA (Modern Spanish
reference corpus). Once the tokens from the deverbal nouns had been extracted, we
analyzed the competition between different nouns derived from the same verb. Our
aim is to study the competition and organization, at least in our first approach, of
transfer verb nominalizations beyond their mere lexicographic documentation.
To this end, we have grouped the verbs together according to the number of
Â�
deverbal nouns they posses: one (unary series), two (binary series) or three (ternary
series). Binary series have been divided into subgroups according to the Â�morphological
processes involved (conversion and suffixation ending in -miento, conversion and
Â�
suffixation ending in -ción, suffixation ending in -miento and in -ción) and these
Â�
subgroups have, in turn, been divided into a further two subgroups according to the
documentation date of the deverbal nouns.
In each subgroup we have analyzed those properties that can explain the
Â�
appearance and disappearance of the various nouns, focusing mainly on changes in
meaning, frequency, morphological constraints, blocking and diatopic diversity.
2.â•… Unary series
In the group of verbs chosen – transfer verbs – several of them have only had one single
deverbal noun all through history and still do at present. In spite of how normal this
may seem, the formation of a single deverbal noun can be explained, in every case, by
means of some kind of constraint which has a major effect on determining the process
that may be used to create that noun among the numerous existing possibilities.
The first group of deverbal nouns is composed of nouns that come from a Latin
noun and which, in Spanish, can be considered simple, in which the existence of

a noun inherited from Latin with the meaning of ‘action or effect’ prevents the
Â�
formation of other nouns:
		 commercĭum > comercio (1267) – comerciar3
		 contāgĭum > contagio (1490) – contagiar
		 obsěquĭum > obsequio (1384) – obsequiar
		 armāmentum > armamiento/armamento – armar
In other cases the situation is a little more complicated, so we will go from Â�
specific
cases – studying two in particular – to general cases. One of the cases includes
nouns such as retribución [retribution], contribución [contribution] and distribución
Â�
[distribution]; the other focuses on the noun devolución [return].
In the first case, there is a Latin deverbal noun ending in -tiō -ōnis which
Â�
determines the form the Spanish noun adopts and blocks new formations.
		 rētrĭbūtĭo > retribución – retribuir < rētrĭbŭo
		contrĭbūtĭo > contribución – contribuir < contrĭbŭo
		distrĭbūtĭo > distribución – distribuir < distrĭbŭo
In addition to these verbs and nouns, there were in Latin other cases of prefixed verbs
such as attrĭbŭo, intrĭbŭo, trĭbŭo, each with its respective nouns (attrĭbūtĭo, intrĭbūtĭo,
trĭbūtĭo). Spanish has only inherited some (atribuir/atribución [to attribute/attribu-
tion], contribuir/contribución [to contribute/contribution], distribuir/distribución [to
distribute/distribution], retribuir/retribución [to pay/retribution], tribuir/Â�
tribución
[to tribute/tribute]). Therefore, the existence of tribuir and tribución4

a period of time we use (Year-Year), if there are gaps between periods we use (Year-Year,
Â�
Year-Year), if a derived word is documented in different years but irregularly we use (Year,
Year, Year) and if it is only documented in a single year we would use (Year,) (mind the
comas). If a possible derived word has not been documented in the corpus, Google-books has
been consulted, meaning its date will appear as GB; dates from Google-books have been used,
as you will see, with great caution and solely to certify that the word in question was used.
ïœ´.â•… We have found in CORDE 3 tokens of tribuir (1385, 1424, 1528), 3 of tribuida (1423(2)
y 1427), 4 of tribuido (1427(2), 1869, 1880) and one case of tribuçion (1423).
ïœ²ïœ³ïœ¶	 Antonio Rifón Sánchez
could lead us to believe that these verbs are prefixed upon tribuir (re-, con-, dis-, a- +
tribuir).5 However, the rare documentations of tribuir and tribución and the informa-
tion on other formations we will look at next seem to support two ideas: firstly, that the
use of tribuir and tribución is more likely to be due to a learned usage or to the recovery
of the Latin verb and noun than to a real usage of these forms in Spanish; and secondly,
that we cannot rule out the use of Latin models in Spanish word formation.
In the second case, devolución, the outlook is somewhat different. There is no
*devolutio in Latin, but ēvŏlūtĭo, invŏlūtĭo, obvŏlūtĭo, rěvŏlūtĭo do exist with their
Â�corresponding verbs ēvolvo, involvo, obvolvo, rěvolvo. In Latin, there were a lot of
Â�prefixed verbs derived from volvo without a deverbal noun; such as those prefixed using
ad-, circum-, con-, de-, di-, per-, pro-, sub-, super- and trans-. As usual, not all verbs
existing in Latin have been passed on to Spanish, but their deverbal nouns have been
inherited, for example evolución, revolución e involución. This inheritance has made it
possible for new deverbal nouns to be created in Spanish despite the verb not existing or
having evolved into a new Romance form; so we have devolución (1278), circunvolución
(1611) or convolución (1963). In these cases, the only thing that makes these formations
possible is a model on Latin forms, since verbs ending in -volvo have evolved towards
Romance forms and those forms have created their own deverbal nouns, as in envolver/
envolvimiento [to wrap/wrapping], revolver/revolvimiento [to stir/stirring], devolver/
devolvimiento [to return/return], avolver/avolvimiento, volver/volvimiento.
So we are faced with two formation models, one created upon the Latin forms
and another upon Romance forms. That way, there are pairs of verbs upon both forms,
remitir [to refer]/remeter [to reinsert], that can present two deverbal nouns, remisión/
remetimiento
	 (3)	
o dejó memoria por su famoso bando disponiendo el remetimiento de todas
las rejas salientes de las fach (Mesonero Romanos, Ramón de, 1880–1881,
Memorias de un setentón, España).
or cases in which the Latin and Romance verb coincide (legar [to bequeath]) but
can present two different deverbal nouns, one Latin and one Romance (legación/Â�
legamiento). There are also cases in which there is a Romance verb with one or two
nouns, such as devolver, whose nouns are devolución and devolvimiento.6
ïœµ.â•… Another possibility is to consider them not built complex words (Corbin 1987:â•›185–188)
in which we have the structure prefix + tribuir and where the constraint for building a Â�deverbal
noun ending in -ción is due to the constraint upon the base.
ïœ¶.â•… For a clear and extensive description of the relation between Latin and Spanish lexical
families, see Pena (2008) and Pena and Campos (2009).
	 Nominalizations of transfer verbs	 ïœ²ïœ³ïœ·
We might add, as a note, that it seems as if the Latin character of the verbal
base determines the degree of possibility of creating a Romance deverbal noun; so,
for Â�
example, all the nouns ending in -tribuir are similar to Latin ones; concerning
thus Â�
ending in -mitir, there are very few types ending in -miento; and yet, in the cases
Â�ending in -legar, where both stems coincide, the number of pairs increases: legación/
legamiento (1254), delegación/delegamiento (1498), and in other non-transfer verbs like
alegar [to claim] or relegar [to leave out], there is alegación/alegamiento (1454–1456),
relegación/relegamiento (1948 1951). No doubt, this tendency must be studied in more
depth in order to find out if it really does exist and to what extent.
Not wanting extend this work unnecessarily, I have included a list of the different
families that, with some specific nuances for each one, could be placed in this group
and in which the deverbal noun has been determined.
		 rěmissĭo > remisión – remitir < rěmitto
		 transmissĭo > trasmisión – trasmitir < transmitto
		 rēstĭtūtĭo > restitución – restituir < restituo
		 lēgātĭo > legación – legar < lēgo; legamiento
		 dēlēgātĭo > delegación – delegar < dēlēgo; delegamiento
		 adjūdĭcātĭo > adjudicación – adjudicar < adjūdĭco; adjudicamiento
		 cessĭo > cesión – ceder < cēdo; cedimiento
		 concessĭo > concesión – conceder < concēdo; concedimiento
		 expědītĭo > expedición – expedir < expědĭo
		 dōnātĭo > donación – donar< dōno; donamiento
		 admĭnistrātĭo > administración – administrar < admĭnistro
		 exportātĭo > exportación – exportar<7 exporto
		 subventĭo > subvención – subvencionar; subvencionamiento8
In all of these cases there is a Latin deverbal noun and, in most of them, there is also
a deverbal noun of purely Romance creation, and in all of them the deverbal noun
Â�
created by the Latin model prevails.
In others, although the Latin noun may not exist or not have been inherited, there
is an analogy with other Spanish forms that do follow the Latin model.
		 devolución – devolver (revolución, involución, evolución)
		 expendición – expender (expedicion)
		 deparación – deparar (separación, comparación, reparación, preparación)
ïœ·.â•… Both exportar and importar are taken from Latin towards the 19th century. Their
deverbal nouns importación 1527 and exportación 1574 are also taken. Importe appears in
1817 but, on seeing that the meaning of “action or effect” of importar is already taken by
importación, it takes another meaning.
ïœ¸.â•… In this case, the Latin verb has not been inherited. Instead, a new one has been created
from the deverbal noun.
ïœ²ïœ³ïœ¸	 Antonio Rifón Sánchez
There are, in addition to those we have already looked at, other morphological
Â�
constraints upon the base. In these cases, the suffix added to the base determines, in
a way, the combination possibilities with nominalization suffixes. So, verbs with the
suffix -ecer tend to build their verb using -miento as well as the parasynthetic prefixes
en- and a-:
		 -ecer: favorecer, abastecer.
		 en-: endilgar, enjaretar, encasquetar.
What also occurs with derived verbs ending in -izar and -ificar is that they build their
nouns ending in -ción.9
		 -izar: comercilizar, indemnizar.
		 -ificar: dosificar.
As we have already mentioned, although the existence of one single deverbal noun
may seem normal, it is not. We have found binary and ternary series – that is, with two
or three nouns – that have co-existed or continue to do so.
3.â•… Binary series
This section includes a group of verbs that have lead to two nouns created through
conversion or affixation using -miento or -ción. Our aim is to analyze what happens
when two deverbal nouns appear and co-exist during a given period of time and,
to do so, we will analyze each of these formations starting with those in which the
verb has lead to one noun through conversion and another using -miento, and will
then go on to study the combinations of conversion and -ción, and finally, -ción and
-miento.
3.1â•… 
Conversion and -miento
This series will be organised in two groups. The first one, where nouns formed through
conversion come before those ending in -miento, and the second, where -miento comes
before conversion.

(2002), among others.

		 cambio (1187) (camio 1055) – cambiar – cambiamiento (1377, 1858 1947)
		 desembolso (1619) – desembolsar (1550) – desembolsamiento (GB)

		 regalo (1356) – regalar – regalamiento (1457)
		 saldo (1424) – saldar – saldamiento (GB)
We will now go on to analyze three different groups based on the characteristics of the
noun -miento: nouns ending in -miento that have disappeared, nouns that have been
kept and, lastly, some that have been created in the present day.
The first group is composed of alquilamiento, cambiamiento, empeñamiento,
Â�giramiento and regalamiento. The life of these five formations has been short and not
very productive, since, apart from empeñamiento with 20 documented tokens, cambia-
miento has only 3 documentations; alquilamiento, 2; giramiento, 2; and regalamiento, 1.

whether they really are base and derived word and of the direction of derivation if it exists.
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… Among these formations there are loanwords from other languages and more Â�patrimonial
derivations for which we would refer to Pena (1980, 191–211). Etymologically, these words
can often have several interpretations and, morphologically, it is difficult to establish an order
in the derivation between the verb and the noun ending in -o/-a.

Their intermittent character is not only shown in their rare usage, but also in the time
lapsebetweentheirappearances,meaningtheyhavelittleinfluenceonotherÂ�formations.
So, cambiamiento appears in the 14th century, again in 1858 and Â�
reappears in 1974;
giramiento in the 15th and 20th centuries. We must add that, as regards Â�
meaning,
they have not really codified – apart from alquilamiento and regalamiento – the sense
of ‘transference’ of the verb, but rather a sense of ‘substitution’ in Â�
cambiamiento and
‘manner of motion’ in giramiento.
Three are the nouns ending in -miento that have preserved their usage until
the present day and that, in addition, are more frequent than the previous ones:
Â�
abonamiento (17 tokens), entregamiento (41), and pagamiento (160).
On the one hand, entregamiento and pagamiento disappear in the 18th century,
and reappear in the 20th century having changed their meaning and acquired as a base
the unaccusative sense of the verb [‘to hand oneself in’ and ‘to pay’]:

	 Nominalizations of transfer verbs	 ïœ²ïœ´ïœ±
It is true that in the 20th century two tokens of entregamiento were documented where
it preserves its sense of ‘transference’, but it could be considered that, in both cases, its
old meaning has been recovered, since they are quotes from older texts:
	(16)	
ue de presente no paresce, renuncio las leyes del entregamiento, prueba y
paga… y por esta razon me (Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo 1905, Orígenes de
la novela, España).
	(17)	
o de la entrega de Granada. …Y quanto decís del entregamiento de las llaues
de Granada cierto fué cos	 (Miguel Garrido Atienza 1910, Las capitulaciones
para la entrega de Granada, España).
In any case, the break is clear; the last use of pagamiento in the sense of ‘transference’
is from 1782 and, when it reappears in 2002, its meaning varies. The reappearance of
entregamiento in 1917 since 1756 also shows a change in meaning.
Abonamiento disappears in the 16th century, only to reappear in the 20th
Â�
century, although no longer with the verbal meaning of ‘transference’, but with that of
‘modification’:
	(18)	
Todo fiador que quisiere pagar aquello porque es fiador, bien puede pagar y el
que a reçebido la cosa porque entro fiador, debe dar fiador de abonamiento, y
este fiador fiador postrero debe tornar a este que le puso fiador. (Anónimo, a
1530, Fuero reducido de Navarra, España).
	(19)	
Por ejemplo Tacama, siendo una empresa grande, tiene 150 hectáreas con
riego por gravedad en las que se logra una excelente producción practicando
por supuesto un abonamiento correcto juntamente con los sistemas de cultivo
tradicionales, mediante una mezcla entre espaldera y pérgola, (VV.AA. 1991,
Desarrollo de la vitivinicultura en el Perú, Perú).
Despite the change in meaning, it continues to compete with abono, since it has both
the meaning of ‘transference’ and the meaning of ‘modification’ of the verb base:
	(20)	

“Estamos al principio”, (El País, 02/12/1988: El Gobierno nombrará en
enero a los oficiales que encabezarán las misiones de…, España).
However, the situation is different. Abonohas already extended its meaning toÂ�designate
both the process of abonar and the result or ‘the substance’ used to abonar [to fertilise]’,
whilst abonamiento only seems to designate the process.12
ïœ±ïœ².â•… In abonamiento, as we have already seen, the meaning of transference disappears in the
16th century, but furthermore, all the examples found in the CORDE refer to the process, not
having extensions of meaning towards the effects.

Lastly, the formations documented outside the corpus (ofertamiento, desembolsa-
miento, intercambiamiento and saldamiento)13 must be dealt with carefully due to the
nature of the source. They can be used as proof that the suffix -miento is still in use in
word formation more than could be expected from lexicographic sources.
In conclusion, the competition between forms through conversion and forms
Â�ending in -miento has turned out in favour of the former, which have forced their
competitors into disappearance or semantic motion. This does not mean there is a rule
against the formation of nouns ending in -miento, and proof of this is that they continue
to appear and be documented, thus supporting the idea proposed by Rainer (1993,
p. 608) stating that formations ending in -miento are still, more or less, productive.
3.1.2â•… Nmiento – V – Sconversion
Nouns ending in -miento only appear first in two cases:
		 enviamiento (1280–1584) – enviar – envío (1583)
		 cruzamiento (1670) – cruzar – cruce (1870)14
Envío was dated by Corominas and Pascual (1983) in the 19th century, however, we
have documented isolated tokens in the 16th and 17th centuries:
	(26)	

This does not mean that the documentation by Corominas and Pascual is completely
mistaken, since it was in the 19th century when its usage became truly widespread and
it appeared in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Española in 1873, as the authors
said. Even so, it is important to point out that it was implanted gradually, allowing us,
for example, to see 20 tokens in the 17th century. The arrival of envío determines the
existence of enviamiento, for which we have only found 23 tokens, which end in the
16th century with the arrival of envío.
The case of cruzamiento/cruce presents some differences as regards the previous
one. It is not entirely true that cruzamiento was documented before cruce, since we
found a documentation of the latter in 1549:
	(31)	
de Damasco aquel día de la fiesta. Toparon en un cruce de carreras quien en
el aire y ropa bella, hone (Jerónimo de Urrea, 1549, Traducción de “Orlando
furioso” de Ludovico Ariosto, España).
However, it does not reappear until the second half of the 18th century, as indicated by
Corominas and Pascual (1983). Even so, we have included them in this group because
the widespread use of cruce comes after that of cruzamiento.
Cruzamiento appears in 1625, only to reappear in 1793, and expands its usage as
of 1833:
	(32)	

ïœ²ïœ´ïœ´	 Antonio Rifón Sánchez
In this pair, the conversion noun has not caused the noun ending in -miento to disap-
pear, as it did in the previous pair, but has caused its semantic motion. Â�
Cruzamiento
becomes specialised, after the 19th century, in the verbal meaning of ‘union’, and within
this meaning has the sense of ‘crossing between races, peoples, individuals, animals,
etc.’; of 533 tokens found, 427 have this meaning. The specialization of cruzamiento in
the verbal meaning of ‘union’ leaves all other meanings of the verb cruzar (‘movement’,
‘transference’ and ‘posture-position’) available for cruce:
	(35)	
nos pordioseros. La carroza se detiene en el cruce de calles, antes de llegar
a la iglesia de las (González, Eladia 1999, Quién como Dios, México).

Â�

This does not mean that cruzamiento cannot be seen deriving these verbal senses, but
it does so in a sporadic way and less often than with the sense of ‘union’:
	(38)	
yer a las 10 de la mañana, cuando circulaba en el cruzamiento de las calles 17

Nevertheless, cruce seems able to broaden its meaning towards result and effect with
greater ease than cruzamiento, even with a meaning of ‘union’, where cruzamiento is
predominant:

Here again we find the predominance of conversion forms upon -miento forms,
although the latter appeared earlier in time. Being less semantically multifunctional,
they lose ground until they disappear or specialise their meaning. We might add that,
in both cases, the 18th and 19th centuries are key points in the choice of one derived
noun or another.

Conversion – -ción
Let us now see if changing the suffix, from -miento to -ción, the reasons for appearance
and disappearance of pairs are the same as in previous cases.

3.2.1â•… Nconversion – V – S-ción
Three elements compose this series:
		 préstamo (1202) – prestar (1200) – prestación (1400)
		 destino (1407) – destinar (1425) – destinación (1598),
		 patrocinio (1377) – patrocinar (1602) – patrocinación (1604, GB)15
The three nouns ending in -ción have lived on to the present day. Even so, we can reject
patrocinación [sponsoring], since there is only one documented case from 1604.

and others from Google-Books which, as we have said, merely suggest that this type
of nouns are still being created. Therefore we still have prestación [provision] and
Â�
destinación [destination].
Prestación specialises in the derivation of two senses of the verb. One from the
‘support verb’ which sometimes combines with juramento (prestar juramento [to
swear]) and sometimes, mostly after the 19th century, with servicios sociales [social
services], estatales [state services], feudales [feudal services], etc. It also presents some
tokens, the least, with the verbal sense of ‘transference’, without posing considerable
competition for préstamo [loan].

In the case of destino/destinación [destiny/destination] we have not found clear
Â�
differences between uses and meanings, although we did find diatopic differences, as
ïœ±ïœµ.â•… We must specify that préstamo is not derived from prestar, but comes from praestimare
or from a Latin praestitare crossed with the pre-Roman suffix -imo/amo, as pointed out
by Â�
Corominas and Pascual (1983). What matters now is that it is in the same position as a
Â�
deverbal noun formed through conversion. Furthermore, we must mention that prestación
and destinación were already present in Latin, praestĭnātĭo and destĭnātĭo, meaning they could
be included in the first section, but we have placed them here due to their relation with nouns
formed through conversion.

destinación.

Two observations regarding this information: firstly, prestación shows huge devel-
opment since the 19th century, while destinación gains strength in the 20th, meaning
they are modern derived words as regards préstamo and destino which appeared in
the 13th and 15th centuries respectively. Secondly, destinación shows a greater use in
South America than in Spain, which implies they are marked diatopically.
3.2.2â•… S-ción– V – Sconversion
There are other three cases in which the derived noun ending in -ción comes before
nouns created through conversion:
		 reintegración (1499) – reintegrar (1377) – reintegro (1703)
		 suministracion (1748–09 1976–2000) – suministrar (1600) – suministro (1819),
		 subastación (1489, 1733–1904) – subastar (1785) – subasta (1759)
Subastación (auction), form the Latin sŭbhastātĭo, where it already had the meaning of
‘public sale’, has been documented with 22 tokens, 14 of which are from the 15th century,
5 from the 18th, 2 from the 19th and 1 from the 20th; however, it can be said that it was
already a disappeared word in the 18th century or beginning of the 19th, since cases
from the end of the 19th and 20th centuries are used in earlier texts or constructions:

	 Nominalizations of transfer verbs	 ïœ²ïœ´ïœ·
So, the appearance of subasta [auction] towards the end of the 18th century caused the
noun ending in -ción to disappear.
	(49)	

Â�
posturas, se les haga saber á l (Anónimo, 1759, Carta de Fernando VI
Â�
[Documentos para la historia de la Universidad de Salamanca], España).
To the appearance of subasta we must add, as a possibly influential element in
the decline of subastación, that it already had a relatively fixed usage, appearing
7 times in combination with ejecución y subastación [execution and auction] and
subastación pública [public auction] and twice as in subastación y adjudicación
Â�
[auction and sale].
Suministración [supply], also inherited from the Latin summĭnistrātĭo, has only 11
tokens documented very sporadically over time. There are three tokens documented
in the 18th century (1748, 1776, 1780), 1 from the 19th century (1832), 4 from the turn
of the 20th century in a single work (the Reina-Valera Bible) from 1909, 1 from the end
of the 20th century in 1976 on the suministración de hormonas [hormone supply] and
3 in the 21st century with the meaning suministración de equipos de obra [construction
work supplies]. Suministración, with its Latin precedent, cannot stand the pressure
from its competitor which appeared shortly afterwards and disappears.

The case of reintegración [refund] is different, both numerically, with 213 documented
tokens, and in meaning, since as opposed to others, reintegro/reintegración compete
with the same codification of meanings of the verb and end up sharing them out in
a more or less peaceful fashion. Reintegración presents 18 tokens for ‘transference’
[meaning ‘to give back’] and 195 for ‘union’ [‘to re-integrate’]. At first it coexisted with
reintegro to indicate ‘transference’, but this meaning gradually disappeared and by the
19th and 20th centuries triggered the meaning of ‘union’.
3.3â•… -miento and -ción
The suffixes -ción and -miento not only compete with words formed through conversion,
but also among themselves.
3.3.1â•… N-miento – V – N-ción
There is only one case in which -miento comes before -ción.
		 arrendamiento (1237) – arrendar – arrendación (1472–1544),
In this pair of derived words, the noun ending in -miento has been kept and, as we will
see, it is the only case in which the noun ending in -miento is kept when competing
ïœ²ïœ´ïœ¸	 Antonio Rifón Sánchez
with the noun ending in -ción. The reason for its preservation is diatopic, since of the
34 tokens of arrendación documented, 29 belong to texts from the region of Aragon.

This way, arrendación, a diatopically marked word, disappears in the 16th century,
triggering arrendamiento.
3.3.2â•… N-ción – V – N-miento
We have already looked at some cases of competition between -ción and -miento when
discussing unary series and the formation of derived words upon Latin and Romance
stems. There, the suffix -ción prevailed upon classic stems and was the one used in
Latin formations, while -miento was used in the derivation of Romance stems. There
are, as well as the cases we have seen, others in which both suffixes compete, where the
derived word ending in -miento appears after the word ending in -ción and where it is
the -miento word which puts pressure on the other, as in:
dejación (1493–1586) – dejar – dejamiento (1550–1997)
extensión (1427) – extender – extendimiento (1440–1633 1981 1994)
facilitación (1701) – facilitar – facilitamiento (1997–2000)
financiación (1896) – financiar – financiamiento (1923)
impartición (1964) – impartir – impartimiento (1997)
In the case of financiación/financiamiento [financing] two aspects must be pointed out.
Firstly, both derived words made their appearance between the 19th and 20th Â�centuries;
	 Nominalizations of transfer verbs	 ïœ²ïœ´ïœ¹
secondly, they are diatopically differentiated, since financiación is Â�
documented 4356
times in Spain, and only 477 in South America, and financiamiento appears 56 times
in Spain and 3346 in America.
In facilitación [provision/facilitation] the compositional meaning of the derived
word prevails in the verbal sense of ‘modification’ [‘to make easier’] with 143 tokens, but
in the 20th century, 24 tokens appeared using the sense of ‘transference’. Â�
Concerning
its counterpart facilitamiento, only 3 tokens were documented, all with the verbal sense
of ‘modification’.

Â�
noviembre de 1998, Argentina).
The three tokens documented are not enough to establish a diatopic difference,
although a superficial search on Google-Books seems to back this tendency in the use
of facilitamiento.
Not all tokens show a diatopic differentiation. Instead, the competition between
derived words has caused the specialization of one or both of them, thus allowing a
relatively peaceful coexistence.
Dejación [abandonment] takes the meanings of ‘transference’, ‘permission’ and
‘motion’ whilst dejamiento derives the meanings of ‘transference’ and ‘permission’
until the 16th century, after which it only indicates ‘permission’.

In other cases, there is no specialization. Instead, one derived word completely Â�occupies
the area of meaning, causing the other to disappear or limiting its use. So, Â�
impartición
[giving] has 85 documented tokens with the nominalization of the Â�
‘support verb’ (the
giving of lessons, courses, etc.) and 48 of ‘transference’, but always in the sense of
‘impartición de justicia’ [spreading justice], just like the only 2 tokens of impartimiento,
with its use limited by impartición.

Lastly – we have already looked at some cases – the derived word may not manage to
establish its usage, but disappears sporadically and in a constrained way, as is the case
of extendimiento [spreading]. In spite of having documented 31 tokens, we cannot say
it has had an excessively continued use. It was used 21 times in the 15th century, but
mainly in two works: Traducción del Tratado de cirugía de Guido de Cauliaco. Madrid,
BN I196 y Universal vocabulario en latín y en romance by Alfonso de Palencia, where
it was used 11 and 8 times respectively. It was used once in the 16th century and again
7 times in the 17th century in a single work (Breve compendio de la carpintería de lo
blanco y tratado de alarifes by Diego López de Arenas), only to reappear in the 20th
century with 2 tokens, but at least one of them could be due to the recovery of an
Â�
earlier use (extendimiento castellano).

4.â•… Ternary series
There are also series in which nouns have been formed by means of three processes
studied:
dispensar – dispensación (1256), dispensa (1256), dispensamiento (1250, GB)
dotar – dote (1058), dotación (852), dotamiento (1348–1491)
repartir – reparto (1225), repartición (1381), repartimiento (1335)
sufragar – sufragio (1374), sufragación (1714, 1889 1980, GB), sufragamiento
(GB)
tributar — tributo (1200), tributación (1484), tributamiento (1327–1395)
traspasar – traspaso (1200), traspasación (1550–1645), traspasamiento (1376–1589
1903)
vender – venta, vendición (1247–1450), vendimiento (1247–1450 1956 1969)
	 Nominalizations of transfer verbs	 ïœ²ïœµïœ±
In some, the noun ending in -ción prevails over the others, as in dispensar [to give],
dotar [to provide], sufragar [to defray],tributar [to pay]. In these cases the noun
through conversion is specialised to designate result or other derived meanings, which
makes it possible for another noun, in this case ending in -ción, to be used to desig-
nate process. A slightly different case is that of dispensación. Dispensa preserves the
meaning of process, causing dispensación to suffer a specialization process, starting by
taking the meaning of ‘obligation’ of the verb, only to change, near the end of the 18th
century and beginning of the 19th, towards ‘transference’ and ending up specialising
in the context of dispensación de medicamentos y drogas [dispensing of medicine and
drugs] at the end of the 20th century.
In another group, we find a noun of ‘action or effect’ ending in -a which occupies
the main more productive role (vender [to sell], traspasar [to go through]), leaving the
other two to a different development.
On the one hand, vendición has disappeared due to its similarity to bendición
(blessing); on the other hand, vendimiento, documented 32 times, 30 before the 15th
century, is used in formations such as carta de vendimiento y roboramiento16 [letter of
sale and certification]

both times with this meaning, although one of them is a quote taken from
an earlier text:

ïœ²ïœµïœ²	 Antonio Rifón Sánchez
In the second case, traspasamiento takes both the meaning of ‘transference’ and of
‘motion’, the latter in a metaphorical sense as in breaking the law, commandments, etc.
but in this field, it encounters transgresión [transgression] and disappears.
5.â•… 
By way of a summary and conclusions
We have analyzed nominalizations of 62 transference verbs as regards their use
found in our corpus (CORDE and CREA), which allows us to visualise the evolution
of the competition between the three morphological processes studied: conversion,
Â�suffixation using -ción and suffixation using -miento. Of the 62 verbs analyzed, 66.13%
have had more than one deverbal noun.
The creation of a single noun is due to constraints of various kinds: token-block-
ing (Rainer 1988, 2005), caused by the existence of a synonymous noun; the classic
character of the verb; or constraints upon the base, due to a given suffix or prefix.
Apart from these constraints, it seems that this formation has been prolific in the use
of these processes.
In the formation of derived nouns not all combinations have shown the same
degree of coexistence. Without doubt, the suffix -miento is the most competitive with
others, and has entered competition with 14 verbs through conversion and 13 Â�
ending
in -ción, not including the 7 in which the three formation processes compete. The
Â�suffix -ción only competes with conversion in 6 cases, and in 13 with -miento.
Intheconflictestablishedbetweencompetingnouns,itistheprocessof Â�conversion
that tends to prevail and remain. When competing with -ción, it causes the disappear-
ance of two nouns, a change of meaning in a further two and diatopic differentiation in
another. When competing with -miento, it causes the disappearance of 6 nouns and a
change of meaning in 4. The suffix -miento is not favoured either in its encounter with
-ción, since -ción prevails in 7 types, there is a change of meaning in 1 and a Â�
diatopic
differentiation in another. However, the suffix -miento perseveres and at Â�
present is
the process that creates the most nouns, although, due to few tokens or the type of
Â�
documentation, it is hard to tell how it will evolve in the future; so, we have counted 8
nouns created using -miento at present, thus competing with the other kinds of forma-
tions, which is proof of the vitality of this suffix.
We can recall the criteria used by Bernal and DeCesaris (2006) in order to explain
the evolution in the conflict between suffixes. These authors point out chronological
causes for some forms having disappeared or fallen into disuse: causes of semantic or
pragmatic specialization and causes of semantic selection by the verbal base, making a
given noun adopt a given meaning of the verb.
These three causes are, also, responsible for the competition between our deverbal
nouns. The competition between nouns leads to an attempt at differentiating nouns
	 Nominalizations of transfer verbs	 ïœ²ïœµïœ³
either semantically, diatopically or through the disappearance of one of them, but we
cannot go as far as saying that stability is reached. There is not a moment when, having
ridden itself of the competition, the surviving noun remains unaltered. Competition
is ongoing and only from the point of view of evolution can we observe it and the
multiple movements that take place within morphological organization. If the aim is
to Â�create a deverbal noun of ‘action or effect’, when one is created it takes that meaning.
The arrival of another implies competition and- thanks to the push of the new noun –
can cause the already existing noun to move to other areas of meaning, or it can be the
new noun that moves when faced with the resistance of the older one, thus sharing out
the meanings. It can also occur that the push of the new one or resistance of the old one
completely eliminates the other, making it disappear. This tug of war and Â�
movement
involves, at least, two elements: time and frequency. The former is Â�
necessary for the
motion of derived words or the possible disappearance of one of them. The frequency
affects the strength with which one derived word pushes the other and the resistance
offered by the one being pushed. This process is linked with the productivity, not only
of the derived words involved as types, but also of the derivation models and, this way,
it affects the entire morphological organization.

Over the last few years, researchers have discussed the prime importance of
semantic factors when it comes to defining the possibilities of combination
and selection between derivational bases and affixes with respect to different
languages. Based on a close revision of the categorial and semantic restrictions
that seem to influence base-affix (in)compatibility, this paper examines verbal
formations with the prefix des- in Spanish. Despite the need to deal with issues
such as the argument structure of derivation and its semantic peculiarities and
those of the prefixes, this study argues that it is still useful to bear in mind the
so-called categorial restriction. In order to review the proposals made by different
researchers, this paper focuses on verbs with the prefix des-, one of the most
productive word-formation processes in present-day Spanish.

The recently published Nueva Gramática de la Lengua Española states: “Por lo Â�
general,
las bases con las que se combinan los prefijos se agrupan más claramente por sus
propiedades semánticas que por su categoría gramatical.” (R.A.E. 2009: § 10.3f).

However, when it comes to analysing negative prefixing, a few pages later, it goes on
to specify that: “La categoría de la base constituye en estos casos [derivaciones con
prefijación negativa] una propiedad más relevante que en otras clases de prefijos, ya
que los prefijos negativos de igual significado se suelen distribuir atendiendo a ella.”
(R.A.E. 2009: § 10.10a). Consequently, it seems that this issue on bases and prefixes is
controversial enough to deserve some further attention.
Very particularly over the last few years, researchers working on Â�
different
Â�
languages have discussed the importance of semantic factors when it comes to
Â�
defining the possibilities of combination between derivational bases and affixes. The
Â�
information obtained in these studies is very significant, both on a strictly descriptive
level and on a theoretical level.1
A well-known principle is Aronoff’s (1976:â•›48) Unitary Base Hypothesis. It states
that each derivational affix can be applied to bases belonging to one, and only one, of
the major lexical categories. In view of so many blatant counterexamples (such as the
Spanish des- prefix, which selects verbs, nouns and adjectives), the only way out is to
accept that, in these cases, it is not that one prefix selects bases from various categories,
but that there are as many homonymous prefixes as there are selected categories. The
multiplication of affixes and of word-formation rules derived from Aronoff’s proposal
makes it inadvisable to openly accept it. This enormously restrictive principle is later
complemented by other principles proposed by Scalise (1984); the Unitary Output
Hypothesis, which suggests that each affix can create derived words that belong to one,
and only one, major lexical category and the Modified Unitary Base Hypothesis, which
fits in well with the X-bar theory. The conclusion reached by combining these various
restrictions is certainly strict: a given affix can only be applied to a certain word class,
and one affix can only create a single word class.
These principles, which are interesting in their attempt at a systematic and
Â�
homogeneous organization of affixing processes, are later picked up and unified by
Corbin (1987:â•›482) under the Principe d’Unicité Catégorielle. Nevertheless, Corbin later
reveals certain exceptions (almost systematic exceptions, in fact), especially regarding
appreciativesuffixesandprefixes(Corbin1991:â•›21).However,thistypeofÂ�interpretation
takes a considerable turn when semantic restrictions begin to be Â�considered vital to the
matter. Thus, Corbin herself (1999) advises that it is the Â�semantic impact that each affix
presents what determines whether a given base is (or is not) selected, as well as being
responsible for pointing out the type of sense the affix can adopt. This Â�
consequently
ïœ±.â•… A very brief yet clarifying summary regarding the properties for selecting derivational
affixes (a. grammatical category of the base, b. contextual characteristics of the lexical base, c.
aspectual characteristics of the base) can be found in Piera and Varela (1999:â•›4389–4393). It is
also interesting to observe the restrictions that operate in word-formation processes by Díaz
Hormigo (2004–2005).
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœµïœ·
implies that the processes in which the affix is involved can develop homocategorial
and heterocategorial derivations. In fact, over the years the SILEX group, which brings
together researchers that build on Corbin’s ideas, is shifting from the Principe d’Unicité
Catégorielle towards a Principe d’Unicité Sémantique (see Dal 1977).
In the specific case of Spanish, Rainer (1993:â•›
110–113) notices that there are
very significant cases within derivational processes in which the applicability of a
given rule must be decided on the basis of maily or exclusively semantic instead of
Â�syntactic-categorial criteria.

About categorial restrictions and/or semantic restrictions
Inthispaper,IdonotintendtopresentathoroughreviewoftheprogressiveÂ�development
– despite its considerable results and different views – of the widespread application of
this semanticist point of view towards defining the operative restrictions in Â�
derivational
process selection. Therefore, I have decided to skip some years and start in 2008, a
Â�
sufficiently recent date to serve as proof of the present importance of the question at
hand. With the idea of reducing the scope of the study, and yet not wanting to limit
the matter to a derivational group so specific as words with the prefix des- in Spanish,
I Â�
discuss two works that focus on two other Romance languages (Italian and French),
which are therefore close to Spanish. Furthermore, Iacobini and Scalise’s (2008) work
studies the entire (Italian) prefix system, whilst Amiot’s (2008) very specifically analyzes
the base selection of the equivalent of the Spanish des- (i.e. the French dé-).
2.1â•… 
About prefixing in Italian: Iacobini and Scalise (2008)
Iacobini and Scalise (2008) examine the selective characteristics of Italian prefixes in
order to prove that most of them can be applied to bases that belong to various lexical
categories. As much as 40% of this language’s productive prefixes can be added to three
different categories: nouns, adjectives and verbs. Another 40% can be added to two
categories, and only 20% are limited to a single category.
Seeing how evidently inadequate categorial restrictions are when it comes to the
prefixes’ selection of bases, the alternative conclusion reached is that prefixing selects
its bases following mostly semantic criteria. In fact, only an insignificant number
of prefixes appear to commonly follow that single selection of bases: ri- can only be
applied to verbs, in- as a negation only applies to adjectives. They also conclude that
prefixes, as opposed to suffixes, do not determine the category of the derived word,
but that they merely reproduce it (the output always belongs to the same category as
the base). The interest of this work lies in that, despite being brief, it analyzes all of
Italian’s 49 productive prefixes, which allows them to coherently formulate generaliza-
tions (though not always sufficiently outweighed in other researchers’ proposals, when
they generalize from excessively specific analyzes).
ïœ²ïœµïœ¸	 David Serrano-Dolader
This study takes into account factors that are normally overlooked in this sort
of analysis, such as whether the base selected by a given prefix is simple or derived,
or the difference between attributive adjectives (that may or may not be the base for
derivation) and adjectives of relation (that may or may not be the base for derivation).
Being this thorough allows us to reach certain specifications that ought to be consid-
ered when it comes to analysing the object of our particular analysis: the prefix des- in
Spanish. More specifically, it shows that the importance of considering the specific
category of adjectives of relation as a base is justified by the fact that, as proven, there is
no reason to identify the prefixing of adjectives of relation with the prefixing of nouns.
Despite the affinity between nouns and adjectives of relation, a lot of prefixes can be
applied to the former but not to the latter. Such is the case of prefixes that may be
equivalent to des- in Spanish, like the Italian negative prefixes dis- and s- (see Iacobini
& Scalise 2008:â•›96).
In general terms, Iacobini and Scalise underline the importance of semantic pecu-
liarities, argument peculiarities and Aktionsart in base selection and in determining
the characteristics of derived words created through prefixing.
Some peculiarities related to the des- prefix are today well-known amongst
researchers. For instance, the fact that prefixes that select verb bases take into account
the aspectual characteristics of these bases, e.g. prefixes that express a reverse value (in
Italian de-, dis-, s-) select verbs that describe telic actions (destabilizzare [destabilize],
disunire [separate], scucire [unstitch]).
In the same way, it is also known that the morphological structure of the base
may – or may not – allow different semantic interpretations. A verb such as the Â�
Spanish
descaminar could be interpreted in two different ways. On the one hand, it can be
considered a derivation of the denominal verb caminar [to walk], in which case it has a
reverse meaning (i.e. ‘the opposite action to walking’) which it shares with other verbs
beginning with des- added to a simple non-derived base, such as desandar (literally ‘*to
unwalk’). On the other, it could also be interpreted as a direct parasynthetic derivation
of the noun base camino [path], which would in turn have a limiting meaning (i.e. ‘to
make someone lose their way’).
Although it may seem to distract us excessively from the object of our investiga-
tion, it may be convenient to point out that the semantic factors that are now relevant
to us should also be taken into account in order to explain certain characteristics of the
output in derivational processes:
Les caractéristiques aspectuelles des bases influent également sur la valeur
sémantique du dérivé, par exemple le préfixe dis- peut être ajouté aussi à des verbes
duratifs non téliques (verbes qui expriment des états ou des actions), mais dans
ce cas le préfixe exprime une valeur antonymique (disapprovare ‘désapprouver’,
disobbedire ‘désobeir’). (Iacobini & Scalise 2008:â•›100)
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœµïœ¹
A further characteristic must be added to the previous description: there can also be
a certain degree of co-relation between the category of the base and certain specific
prefixes of a given semantic subtype. So, for example, if we look at the prefixes that
are generally known as negative and if, as is common, we distinguish the sub-values of
‘opposition’, ‘contrariety’, ‘deprivation’ and ‘reversal’, we could state that the ‘contrariety’
negation is typically expressed using attributive adjectives, or that the ‘reversal’ nega-
tion implies prefixing only on verb bases, or that the ‘opposition’ negation operates
with nouns, adjectives and verbs (see Iacobini & Scalise 2008:â•›103).
As a consequence, it seems evident that semantic factors should inevitably be
borne in mind when it comes to specifying the restrictions of prefixes that select Â�certain
bases. This does not imply that the lexical category of the base is completely irrelevant
in these selection processes. The lexical category does play an important role in the
base selection processes of certain prefixes, but contrary to what has been argued for
years, it is not the only factor to take into account, the word class (lexical category)
is also crucial in allowing a prefix to join the base or not. A totally Â�
different issue
is how to define the very concept of lexical categories or word class using Â�
exclusively
semantic characteristics. If that were the case, stating that the base category also influ-
ences the selection would be nothing more than a confirmation that semantics is the
only Â�
decisive factor in base selection. However, nowadays, the suggestion that lexical
categories can be defined exclusively using semantic characteristics seems somewhat
risky, to say the least.2
In my opinion, although categorial distinctions may, at least partly, be established
from semantic properties, these two notions do not completely overlap. Therefore,
the concept of word class (having accepted that it is not a strictly semantic notion)
should still be taken into account, especially in what regards the study and formaliza-
tion of the link between derivational bases and the outputs of word-formation rules.
In this respect, and leaving aside well-known cases of trans-categorial prefixing such
as bello [beautiful] > embellecer [to beautify], and fiebre [fever] (noun) > antifiebre
Â�
[anti-fever] (adjective), it is still possible to argue that prefixing and suffixing operate
in a Â�
considerably different way as far as the relation between base category and output
is concerned. In the case of suffixing, whereas homocategorial relations between bases
ïœ².â•… In recent years, some authors have reclaimed the importance of the role that semantics
plays in specifying lexical base selection, completely overruling categorial criteria. Amongst
these authors is Ingo Plag, who explicitly states that derivative morphology does not have to
necessarily refer to the categorial information of the potential derivational bases and that
any reference to word class should be abandoned because it is deemed irrelevant (or even
Â�
superfluous) and inoperative in the selective process:“[…] the word-class specification of the
input […] is empirically unnecessary, if not theoretically undesirable”. (Plag 2004:â•›214).
ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ°	 David Serrano-Dolader
and derivations are not common or even exceptional (the most extreme case being
appreciative suffixing), they are the norm in prefixing processes. In short, the operative
difference between prefixing and suffixing in derivational processes is considerable,
also from other perspectives that cannot be developed further in this paper.3

About the negative prefix dé- in French: Amiot (2008)
AfterthisbriefoverviewonItalianprefixing,letusnowturntoanotherRomanceÂ�language
– French – in order to delve into the specific problem of base selection by the prefix dé-,
which seems considerably equivalent to the Spanish prefix des- (see Amiot 2008).
The question that needs to be answered now regards the type of base that can be
joined to this prefix (or its equivalents in other Romance languages). The answer is far
from being as straightfoward as it may seem. For example, Corbin (1992) – still faithful
to her previously cited Principe d’Unicité Catégorielle – proposes a monocategorial
analysis of verbs with the prefix dé-, which would all be deadjectival. However, a few
years later Corbin (1997) herself also allows the possibility of denominal derivations,
only to change her mind again in Corbin (2001), where – casting aside her Principe
d’Unicité Catégorielle once and for all – now considers that there are three diverse
derivational processes possible: deadjectival, denominal and deverbal. Now it is not
the time to go into detail about this French linguist’s progressive change of opinion,4
but perhaps this change of perspective could help us showing that the idea that the
restrictions on prefix’s base selection are based on the lexical category of the bases is
still an area open for debate.
And this is precisely the line that Amiot follows when he specifically reviews,
in a very fine explicative manner, the restrictions involved in selecting verb bases
(Amiot 2008:â•›7–8) and noun bases (Amiot 2008:â•›9–11). His analysis introduces a set
ïœ³.â•… “Nous soulignons un autre facteur qui distingue les suffixes des préfixes: les violations
de l’UBH [Unitary Base Hypothesis] qui se produisent dans la suffixation sont non seulement
moins nombreuses que dans la préfixation, mais elles donnent des lexèmes appartenant à une
seule catégorie. En revanche, les préfixes qui s’ajoutent à des bases de catégories différentes
forment des dérivés ayant les mêmes catégories que les bases. Il est donc plausible, qu’une part
importante des violations de l’UBH par des préfixes puisse être ramenée au fait que les préfixes
ne modifient pas la catégorie de la base à laquelle ils s’adjoignent, et que, par conséquent, la
sélection de la base réponde essentiellement aux critères de compatibilité sémantique entre
la base et le préfixe. Par contre, les suffixes peuvent etre plus facilement classés par rapport
à la catégorie lexicale des bases et des dérivés. Même dans le cas où un suffixe s’adjoint à des
lexèmes ayant une catégorie différente (par exemple à des noms et à des verbes), la catégorie
sélectionnée par défaut par le suffixe est évidente […]”. (Iacobini & Scalise 2008:â•›198).
ïœ´.â•… Amiot (2008:â•›1–7) offers a detailed summary of the weak and strong points of each of the
three perspectives that Corbin successively adopts.
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ±
of Â�
complex networks and relations between bases and derived words; more specifi-
cally, he attempts to justify base selection on the basis of the type of relation that exists
between the base-nouns and the arguments belonging to the verb output. Although
Amiot aims at providing a general answer to the complex problem of base selection
for the prefix dé-, when it comes to denominal verbs, he has to finally recognize that:
Il résulte de tout cela, au moins dans l’état actuel de ces recherches, qu’il n’existe
aucun critère qui permette de prédire quel nom pourra être prefixé par dé-. Le
seul critère est, ici aussi, purement sémantique: dé- étant en français actuel un
inverseur d’état, le Nb doit pouvoir être conçu comme entretenant une relation
stative avec un autre élément (qui se réalise en tant qu’argument interne ou externe
du verbe dérivé); c’est à partir de cet état initial présupposé que sera construit le
sens d’inversion. (Amiot 2008:â•›12)
Even if one tries to be as specific as Amiot is, he himself admits that, along with those
verbs carrying the prefix dé-, which are clearly deverbal, and those that are clearly
denominal, there can always be possible cases of derivational ambiguity: déboiser
could have been created either from the verb boiser or from the noun base bois.5
In short, Amiot’s study concludes that the prefix dé- shows no restrictions but
semantic restrictions when selecting its possible bases. The main requirement for a
given verb to be conformed is that the semantic properties of the base lexeme must be
compatible with the semantic instructions included in the prefix dé-. That is, whether
a reversible state – or rather a stative situation – can be expected.
Nevertheless, Amiot does not mean that the base category is completely irrelevant
to an in-depth analysis of our prefix’s selection restrictions. He argues that the prefix
attaches itself to a given lexeme with a given argument structure.6 This necessarily
implies that it is categorized, and can even imply that it is categorized specifically in
a given category, and not in any other. The fact that our prefix can be attached to

in the case of Spanish. This author also extends it – quite rightly, in my opinion – to other
languages such as German (which, I may add, is a much richer language than Spanish when
it comes to formally distinguishing the huge quantity of values, which in Spanish are simply
codified under the prefix des-): the verb entfärben [to de-colour] could be either reversative
with a verb base (‘ent + färben’),or privative parasynthetical with a noun base (‘ent + Farbe + ø
+ en’).He reaches the following general conclusion:“[…] cualquier verbo reversativo formado
sobre un lexema verbal derivado de un nombre, substantivo o adjetivo, puede ser Â�
entendido
también como privativo; pero ningún verbo únicamente privativo, esto es, Â�
construido sobre
una base meramente nominal,puede ser considerado como reversativo.”(Vañó-Cerdá 1990:â•›9).
On this subject, see also Serrano-Dolader (1995:â•›132–133).

verbs, nouns and adjectives is, without doubt, an undeniable proof of the importance
of semantic factors in the selection of derivational bases, but it does not justify directly
ruling out the word-class the base may belong to.

Categorial restrictions and semantic restrictions: Conclusions
and consequences
After this review of Iacobini and Scalise (2008) and Amiot (2008), we can draw one
clear conclusion either from the general study of prefixing in a language such as Italian
or from the specific analysis of the prefix dé- in French: semantics is a key factor in the
base selection of the Spanish prefix des- but other factors such as the lexical category
of the base should not be overruled.
The present situation in the study of derivational processes, both from a
Â�
theoretical as well as an empirical-analytical perspective, makes for three possible
positions regarding the matter of whether affix selection is produced in terms of
Â�
syntactic categories or in terms of semantic categories. These three positions are
nicely summarized in Lieber (2006):
1.	 Selection strictly relies on the base of syntactic categories. This implies that
Â�
lexemes have an inherent syntactic category and, evidently, that that category is
the only relevant element when it comes to defining the base selection process.
2.	 Selection strictly relies on semantic criteria. This point of view is compatible both
with the hypothesis that lexemes completely lack any syntactic category and with
the hypothesis that lexemes do have a syntactic category. No matter which of these
hypotheses is adopted, the syntactic category is essentially irrelevant to the base
selection process.
3.	 Selection can rely both on semantic criteria (and restrictions) and on syntactic
criteria (and restrictions). This suggests that affixes and lexemes have a syntactic
category as well as a semantic category.
In my opinion, although commonly accepted for years, it is wrong to consider the
lexical category of bases as the only means of establishing the criteria that rules selec-
tion processes in derivation; one must abandon this practice. However, it is still quite
problematic to try to reduce to solely semantic criteria the base selection indicators
(although, if progress is made regarding theoretical and descriptive accuracy when
defining semantic characterizations, we may be able to prove that selection is purely
semantic).7
ïœ·.â•… Regarding this, it seems fair to admit that some authors, such as Lieber (2006), are
Â�
formulating theoretically solid proposals that appear to support each other adequately in their
thorough and accurate analysis of derivational processes.
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ³
In the specific case of Spanish, word formation using the prefix des- is an
Â�
enormously productive process, possibly the most operative and vital derivational
process in our lexical morphology. This high level of productivity could be related to
the fact that this prefix allows the selection of any lexical base (whatever its categorial
nature). That is exactly why this prefix is chosen; it would allow us to examine the
constraints it applies to the selection of possible candidates for derivational bases. To
complicate matters a little bit further (or make them more interesting), it is important
not to forget that words with the prefix des- and the prefix des- itself offer a wide range
of meanings. And also, that if the aim is to figure out whether the prefix selects bases
categorially or semantically, it seems vital to differentiate among the possible semantic
uses of the prefix, since they too appear to influence the base selection.8
One of the most operative values of des- is the ‘negative’ value. And of all the
Â�
semantic subgroups of Spanish prefixes, it appears to be the negative ones that pose
most Â�
problems when trying to systematize how their base selection works, which
seems to be the most general and least limited selection of all:
En tanto que [los prefijos negativos] indican carencia de una propiedad o
inexistencia de un estado de cosas, se hacen compatibles con cualquiera de
las categorías mayores, verbos, nombres o adjetivos, siempre y cuando éstos
denoten una situación que pueda ser negada. Sin embargo, de esta situación
se sigue la única restricción que hemos logrado identificar en estos prefijos:
nunca seleccionan adjetivos relacionales, seguramente porque éstos no expresan
propiedades, sino que afirman la relación entre entidades.
Â�
(Fábregas 2001 – unpublished manuscript –)9
ïœ¸.â•… This subject is already covered explicitly by Fábregas (2001 – unpublished –). I would like
to thank this author for allowing me to use his study, written as an essay for a Ph.D. course
in 2001. In this particular case, Fábregas chooses to distinguish three values of des-: ‘locative’,
‘negative’ and‘reversative’.We are now only interested in the fact that the plurality of meaning
of the prefix is taken into account in an attempt to define the restrictions in base selection,and
not so much in whether that division in three values is sufficient enough to study this prefix
in Spanish. In fact, I have proposed elsewhere (Serrano-Dolader 1995:â•›134–143) four different
values (‘ablative’,‘instrumental’,‘effective’,‘privative’) for des- verbs; it could even be narrowed
down more, and consequently multiplying the number of semantic groups.
ïœ¹.â•… It is not uncommon,when studying how operative des- is in Spanish,to end up Â�recognising
that it is so essential that it escapes any attempt to be systematized: “La enorme productivi-
dad de este prefijo impide que se especialice en un tema concreto -como ocurre con otras
partículas prefijales‒; se da en todos los campos de la vida y afecta a cualquier faceta, eso sí,
dentro de un lenguaje normal, pues habitualmente no crea tecnicismos ni es productivo en el
lenguaje científico.” (Montero Curiel 1999:â•›155). Directly related to the case of verbs with the
prefix des-, the topic of this paper, are the objective difficulties when it comes to establishing
the guidelines of the restrictions of base selection in derivation. Haouet (2000) explicitly
deals with these restrictions and draws the following conclusion:“En resumidas cuentas, […]
ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ´	 David Serrano-Dolader
Consequently, stemming from the syntactic versus semantic restrictions noted above,
I argue that there are two premises that should be taken into account in order to
descriptively organize the data and to carry out morphological analysis:
1.	 It is true that certain affixes do not select bases of one or more given grammatical
categories; similarly, it is true that certain affixes only or mostly select bases of one
or more given grammatical categories.10
2.	 It is equally clear that the semantic characteristics of the bases play a crucial role
in their possible selection by a given affix.
However, in my opinion:
3.	 It also seems relevant to consider what kind of contents are to be configured
in a given derivational process. That is, it is relevant if, in a given language, the
Â�
meaning of the output is to be conformed in the verb category, noun category or
adjective category.
As a consequence of the two above-mentioned premises and of the preceeding caveat,
I believe that the most appropriate way to approach the study of the restrictions in base
selection in derivational processes is:
1.	 Specifying which category the affix can (or can not) be added to.
2.	 Trying to establish within each category which semantic (and/or argument)
Â�
characteristics of the bases belonging to that category allow, impede or promote
the corresponding affixing process.
3.	 Studying these restrictions for the derivational process of a given prefix, following
a specific analysis in each output category group (i.e. depending on whether the
output is a verb, noun or adjective).
Â�
analizamos a DES- como un operador que denota la reversión. Tal reversión ha de situarse
en el lugar más periférico del evento en el que interviene; en el caso de los parasintéticos es el
de CAUSAR, pues el uso de este prefijo permite una lectura de cambio reversivo provocado,
es decir, invierte una lectura de cambio en principio impropio. Por ello señalamos […] que
no impone restricciones semánticas de delimitación sobre la base derivativa. El hecho de
Â�
requerir un cambio impropio no parte de la lectura delimitada de la relación interna en la que
aparece la base derivativa sino simplemente de una lectura relacional semántica parte-todo o
contenedor-contenido” (Haouet 2000:â•›40). (Highlighting is mine).
ïœ±ïœ°.â•… This is clear even in the particular group of negative prefixes this paper focuses on:
“[…] los prefijos in- y des-, con valor de contrariedad, se han especializado para determi-
nadas bases categoriales: el primero se une productivamente a bases adjetivas y el segundo,
a bases Â�
verbales. Esto explica que puedan citarse pocas formaciones adjetivas prefijadas con
des- Â�
(excepción hecha de los adjetivos que proceden del verbo prefijado correspondiente) y, a
su vez, que haya pocos verbos con el prefijo in-”. (Varela & Martín García 1999:â•›5022).
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ¶ïœµ
In short, a statement as categorical as the following one should not come as a surprise
in studies on prefixing in Spanish: “Analizar aisladamente el significado de un prefijo
es tarea poco menos que inútil, dado que forma un todo con la B[ase] a la que se une”.
(Brea 1980:â•›124)11
Therefore, I deal with the categorial and semantic restrictions that seem to operate
in the word-formation process. Due to space constraints, I decided to put aside other
problematic restrictions despite their role in this process: phonic restrictions and the
ever controversial – due to its extension and scope – blocking phenomenon.12
3.â•… A specific case: Verb formations with the prefix des- in Spanish
Once the general guidelines for the analysis of derivational base selection are
Â�
established, now is the time for describing the base selection for the prefix des-.13
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… I believe, however, that this statement does not affect all Spanish prefixes in the same
way. In this specific case, it seems to be that, although various values can be given to the prefix
des- and however notable the semantic diversification of the outputs, one must admit that
it cannot be considered a prefix empty of meaning, nor can it, on the contrary, be consid-
ered a prefix of such diverse meanings that it cannot allow us (to a certain extent) to predict
which the semantic inclination – or at least the most likely – of the verb outputs will be. In
Â�
Vañó-Cerdá’s words: “[…] frente al carácter vacío de otros prefijos españoles […], podemos
afirmar que con des- nos hallamos ante un prefijo lleno,capaz por sí mismo de ser portador de
un significado y de mantenerlo cuando entra a formar parte de palabras nuevas”.(Vañó-Cerdá
1990:â•›2). However, and as undeniable proof of the variety of meaning of the prefix des-, there
are even some words in which one could talk about the “superfluous use of the prefix des-”
because it does not appear to add any value to the verb base to which it is added (see Vañó-
Cerdá 1990:â•›24–25): desnegar, desmanchar, desinquietar, desgastar, desraspar…,all of these verbs
have practically the same meaning as that of their corresponding bases without the prefix.
ïœ±ïœ².â•… I also choose to overlook the possible restrictions that are related to the morphological
configuration of the base since they do not seem relevant to the verb formations with the
prefix des-. I refer, for example, to cases where the prefix in- is particularly productive with
deverbal adjective bases with the suffix -ble.
ïœ±ïœ³.â•… Many are the studies that, in a thorough and specific way, have focused on the prefix
Â�
des- in Spanish, including: Vañó-Cerdá (1990), Brea (1994), Battaner Arias (1996), Martín
García (2007). There are also a number of general studies on negative prefixing in Spanish
that, clearly, also focus on this prefix, for example, Montero Curiel (1999), Costa (2008). In the
work of Serrano-Dolader (1995 1999), one can find numerous notes on words with the prefixÂ�
des- in Spanish. Although it may seem obvious to say, due to space restrictions, I have to
Â�overlook a number of issues related to the prefix des- that are equally problematic: its Â�evolution
and Â�
diachronic variation, its competitiveness with other prefixes, its alomorphic diversifica-
tion, the difficulties of lexico-graphic codification of words with des-, and a long list of other
issues of great interest but largely unrelated to the problem in this paper.
ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ¶	 David Serrano-Dolader
As a general characterization, the prefix des- can be added to all three of the major
lexical categories (it is, therefore, an inter-categorial prefix). This prefix is added to
verbs des-andar [to retreat], des-abotonar [to unbutton], nouns des-amor [lack of love],
des-alm-ado [soulless], des-boton-ar [to unbutton], des-rat-iz-ar [to get rid of rats], and
adjectives des-leal [disloyal], des-brav-ar [to tame], des-lateral-iz-ar [to delateralize].14
It is well-known that the degree of productivity of these derivational processes is very
different and also that it is not equally easy to define in all of these processes what kind
of selection restrictions are at play. On the other hand, and as is to be expected when
dealing with a prefixing process, it seems clear that, if it is applicable to all three major
lexical categories, there will also be outputs in those three major lexical categories.15
Following the guidelines mentioned above and if what we wanted is an in-depth
study of the base selection of the prefix des- in Spanish, we should now separately deal
with verbs beginning with des-, adjectives beginning with des- and nouns beginning
with des-, and within each of these output categories, we should try to define which
semantic (and/or argument) characteristics of the bases allow, impede or promote the
corresponding affix process. Nevertheless, in order not to extend this study excessively,
we are going to focus on verb outputs for a variety of reasons: they are the most abun-
dant and productive16 as well as the most semantically different and diverse forma-
tions, and therefore, they are the ones that will allow us to cover a greater number of
aspects directly related to the topic of base selection in derivational processes.17
ïœ±ïœ´.â•… As already discussed elsewhere (see Serrano-Dolader 1995:â•›192–197), it seems evident
that a formation like descabildadamente ‘descabelladamente’ – meaning ‘crazily’ – (which the
DRAE gives an entry of its own) is simply an adverb ending in -mente built on the (regular,
systematic and possible) base descabildada, whereby it is neither a parasynthetic adverb (it is
not created directly from the noun base cabildo), nor – for the matter that concerns us now – a
“deadverbial prefixed word” with des- (i.e. # des-cabildadamente).
ïœ±ïœµ.â•… All I wish to point out is that, in so much as prefixing is a prototypically homocategorial
derivational process, it is clear that if we have nouns, adjectives and verbs as bases, these
three categories will also be possible outputs in the word-formation process. It is not, at this
stage, relevant that formations such as des-boton-ar, des-brav-ar and des-alm-ado could lead to
discussing a heterocategorial prefixing process.
ïœ±ïœ¶.â•… In her thorough study, Battaner Arias (1996) states that 42.88% of the formations
containing des- gathered in the DRAE in 1992 are verbs. And it is well known that the
Â�
productivity for new verb formation is, without a doubt, very considerable.
ïœ±ïœ·.â•… When studies on negative prefixing in Spanish have attempted to explicitly deal with
questions related to the semantic restrictions of base selection, the field most often chosen
has been that of adjective outputs. The reason is clear: it seems that in this field – much
more obviously than in the field of verb outputs – certain tendencies that appear intuitively
Â�
operative can be corroborated. More specifically, there are two hypotheses that have been
worked on (first presented for English and other languages and later applied to Spanish): that
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ·
The prefix des- is, possibly, the most productive verb prefix in Spanish and, as
already mentioned, it can be added – to create verbs – to verb bases (desandar), noun
bases (desbotonar) and, less frequently, to adjective bases (desbravar).18
Given the vitality of this prefix in verb formation (especially deverbal and denom-
inal parasynthetic verbs) and the variety of meanings the verb outputs are orientated
towards, it seems problematic to limit the scope of the base selection that operates in
this derivational process.19 The only way out (which I admit is not, strictly speaking,
a thorough identification of selection restrictions) is to look at the semantic orienta-
tion of verb outputs and, from that point, to infer the type of bases that are normally
most adjective outputs with negative prefixes carry a “derogatory” meaning, and that most of
the adjectives that negative prefixes take as bases should have “positive” or at least “neutral”
values (see Costa 2008:â•›227–248). Regarding the study of semantic guidelines that affect verb
Â�formation in Spanish,Rifón (1997) is a compulsory reference,although his work does not look
at prefixing, but rather focuses directly on verbalization using suffixes.
ïœ±ïœ¸.â•… “Desde los primeros tiempos del español puede apreciarse que hay un prefijo que no sólo
no ha visto disminuida su capacidad de uso sino que la ha acrecentado en gran medida: se
trata de DIS- [forma latina, base –entre otras– de nuestro des-].” (Brea 1976:â•›326).“La forma
popular DES- ha tenido una gran aceptación en la derivación romance, y ha sufrido, al lado
de la fonética, una evolución -o, más bien, una ampliación‒ semántica”. (Brea 1976:â•›
331).
Regarding how operative it is in verb formation,the words of Montero Curiel are indisputable:
“[…] casi cabe cuestionarse si existen formas verbales que no tengan su antónimo con este
prefijo [des-], hecho que resulta difícil si se considera la operatividad, cada día mayor, de esta
partícula para negar la acción representada por una base”. (Montero Curiel 1999:â•›143).
ïœ±ïœ¹.â•… In relation to the operative capacity of the prefix in Latin, Brea states that: “[…] de un
modo especial DIS- y DE- se emplean con verbos, para indicar, o bien que se destruye una
acción anterior (por medio de otra contraria: DIFFRENO, DISCOOPERIO), o bien privación
de algo (sobre todo en los verbos parasintéticos que parten de una Bs [i.e. base sustantiva]:
DISCORTICO, DENASO)”. (Brea 1980:â•›
126). Deep down, and although the scope of ‘nega-
tive’ prefixes in Spanish is quite wide (a-/an-, in-/im-/i-, no, des-/de-/di-/dis-/es-, anti-, contra-,
ex-, extra-, sin-), it is without a doubt the prefix des- the one that has been most successful:
“[…] se ha producido un cambio en el sistema de prefijación negativa, al pasar del latín al
romance. El prefijo culto IN- ha dejado lugar al popular DES-, que tiene sobre aquél la ventaja
de poder aplicarse prácticamente por igual a verbos y a nombres, asumiendo además parte
de los valores de toda una serie de prefijos (DE-, AB-, EX-) que podían llegar a tener en latín
un valor semejante al negativo, e incluso al mismo IN-.” (Brea 1976:â•›
338). I would also like
to mention that although it is common practice to generally classify the above-mentioned
prefixes as ‘negative’, and therefore also the prefix des-, there are authors who have rejected
this classification and considered it to be too particular, given the plurality of meaning of
those prefixes. It is, however, not easy to propose a more generalized classification (see, for
example, the proposal made by Leal Cruz 1989–1990, who, in contrasts such as hacer/deshacer
[do/undo] he prefers to call it the relation between “positive” and “non-positive” – voluntarily
casting aside the concept of “negative”).
ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ¸	 David Serrano-Dolader
chosen to create this or that meaning. And so, as an example, when looking at a series
such as descabezar ‘to behead’, desorejar ‘to remove an ear’, destripar ‘to disembowel’,
desrabar ‘to remove a tail’, desplumar ‘to pluck feathers’…, the type of inference that
can be made is that denominal parasynthetic verbs beginning with des- which have a
privative meaning often select entities that are an inalienable part of the whole. This
explains the vitality of that particular process, and equally explains the potential (i.e.
they are possible words) of verbs such as desbrazar ‘to remove an arm’, desmanar ‘to
remove a hand’, descarar ‘to remove a face’.20 But we certainly can not clearly infer
– as would be desirable for a more precise perspective on selection restrictions – that
those entities that are not an inalienable part of a whole are not able to operate in the
verbalization process.
One final caveat is necessary in order to establish the limits of this study. At this
point, I do not claim that the object of a thorough analysis should be a discussion on
which semantic classification is the most appropriate and precise for verb outputs with
the prefix des- in Spanish. Just to give an idea of the complexity of the problem, all we
need to remember is that, on one hand, the prefix des- can be classified in itself as poly-
semic and, on the other hand, that a given prefix is not added to a word, but rather to
a given sense of a word: “[…] las palabras derivadas se forman a partir de acepciones
concretas de la base, por lo que no heredan todos los valores significativos.” (Martín
García 2007:â•›22).21
ïœ²ïœ°.â•… The vitality and potentiality of any of these formations is easily proven. For instance,
although the verb descararse has a non-compositional meaning (i.e. to speak or act without
shame, rudely and daringly or without decency), and as such it could block the formation
of a regular privative verb such as descarar [to remove the face], nowaydays, and due to the
recent facial transplants carried out in Spain, it could come as no surprise to find in the news
sentences such as “Antes de someter al paciente a la compleja operación hay que descararle”
(“Before putting the patient through this complex operation we must descararle (remove his
face)”). There are also very similar values from the Spanish Golden Age (needless to say, for
entertainment purposes). A barber from a short comic farce said: “El que yo las descare/será
excusado/porque en ser dueñas tienen/harto descaro”. Here, descare is from the verb descarar,
[to remove the face], in contrast with descaro, which means ‘no shame’. (Vicente Suárez de
Deza: El barbero (Entremés), in Teatro Breve, I, Kassel, Reichenberger 2000, p. 114).
ïœ²ïœ±.â•… Costa (2008:â•›
249–277) aims to organize, in a systematic and coherent manner, the
Â�
relations codified using the negative prefixes des-, in- and no-, that is, he tries to systematize
the Â�
semantic associations between bases and outputs in these prefixing processes. To this end,
he Â�
distinguishes five “conceptual features or operations” (Costa 2008:â•›249). They are as follows
(I have included in brackets some examples from the group that now concerns us directly: verbs
with the prefix des-): 1. Negation, strictly speaking, or “simple negation” (desacertar ‘no acertar’
[to not get right], desaprobar‘no aprobar’ [to disapprove]); 2. Entering into a state (this value is
not operative for the prefix des-); 3. Exiting a state (which includes “inversion” (descabezar [to
behead],descalcificar [to decalcify]),“reversal”(desabotonar [to unbutton],descalzar [to remove
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ¶ïœ¹
Once the limits for establishing selection restrictions are clear, let us now look at what
can be specified in each case.22
3.1.â•… Deverbal verbs
In order to simplify the description, we could say that deverbal verbs with the
prefix des- are semantically orientated towards three main groups of meaning: ‘negation
of the verb base’, ‘reversal’ and ‘evaluation’. Evidently, I am not going to be able to go into
an individual analysis of each verb, not even the frequent connotative or more or less
markedly non-compositional content that verbs beginning with des- can adopt.
3.1.1â•… 
Negation of the meaning of the verb base: desobedecer
‘no obedecer’ [to Â�
dis-obey]
This characterization implies, in principle, something so obvious as that the verb base
must express a meaning that can be susceptible to be negated and, contrary to what
occurs with the reversive des-, there need not necessarily be a previous verbal action
on which to operate.
footwear]) and “disgregation” – which she later takes out as a particular Â�
subgroup outside
the group “exiting a state” and labels “dispersion” – (desmigar [to crumble bread Â�
producing
crumbs], destrozar [to destroy])); 4. Privation (Costa warns us that “Los verbos [con prefijo
des-] y sus derivados participiales y adjetivales que podrían admitir una lectura privativa son
aquellos que hemos incluido en las clases de la reversión, la inversión y la dispersión. La razón
por la que fueron incluidos en esas clases es que los rasgos reversivos,inversivos y de dispersión
constituyen sus rasgos caracterizadores y distinguidores. Frente a estos, el rasgo de privación
es común a las tres clases, las que difieren, a este respecto, exclusivamente en relación con lo
que se pierde: un estado, una propiedad, una situación” (Costa 2008:â•›
273)); 5. Intensification
(desgastar [to wear out], deslavar [to wash out]). In short, I believe the Â�
difficulty in classifying
the semantic values of the outputs in static compartments is made clear in this detailed – and
slippery – attempt of systematization by Costa.
ïœ²ïœ².â•… I should mention that the level of specification desirable for this type of analysis would
require a detailed – and, to a degree, individual – study of countless verbs with the prefix des-.
This is something that, for obvious reasons, I cannot pursue here. The careful and extensive
work of Battaner Arias (1996), although fundamentally based on a lexico-graphic repertoire,
can be considered an in-depth, individualized study of verbs beginning with des-. Particularly
interesting are the conclusions she draws regarding the lexico-semantic relations of the series
of words beginning with des- (see Battaner Arias 1996:â•›360–368), and which focus on three
lines of investigation:“1. La relación de los prefijos con el aspecto: el prefijo 〈des-〉 confiere un
aspecto imperfectivo egresivo; 2. La relación con los modos de acción verbal: el prefijo 〈des-〉
confiere diferencias de significado según actúe sobre Actividades, Realizaciones o Logros; 3.
La dimensión ‘de/desde donde’ y el punto de referencia en el que se coloca (lo que en muchos
casos queda reflejado en la base morfológica derivativa), según sea lugar, momento, cualidad,
cantidad del estado o proceso (implícito o explícito)”. (Battaner Arias 1996:â•›360).
ïœ²ïœ·ïœ°	 David Serrano-Dolader
[En este grupo] se incluyen verbos que indican situaciones que no tienen un
resultado, es decir, acciones o procesos (desaconsejar, desayudar, desobedecer) y
estados (desagradar, desconocer, desconfiar). […] Dentro de los verbos negativos,
algunos pueden interpretarse como la interrupción de la acción o estado mediante
la paráfrasis ‘dejar de V’. En estos casos, el verbo con des- implica una acción o
estado previo aunque no supone un resultado como consecuencia de la acción,
dado que se trata de verbos imperfectivos: desamar ‘dejar de amar’. 
 (Martín García 2007:â•›10–11)
As Haouet points out, “La noción de negación de la base se aplica a los casos en que
des- se adjunta a bases verbales [-télico] que denotan una actitud”. (Haouet 2000:â•›427).
Very recently (see R.A.E. 2009: §§ 10.10ñ and 10.10o) – and this is clear proof of
the difficulty of unequivocally defining the concept of ‘negative’ – it has been stated
that verbs belonging to this group contain a meaning of ‘absence’.23
3.1.2â•… Reversal: deshacer ‘acción inversa a hacer’ [to undo]
In this particular subgroup, the action expressed by the verb base has been carried out
and has reached a given state-result. This is precisely what is reversed by the action
expressed using the corresponding des- verb.
Expressing what could seem like an obvious deduction, Vañó-Cerdá clearly warns
us that: “[…] sin la existencia de una acción verbal previa no se puede hablar con propie-
dad de verbos modificados reversivamente por el prefijo des-.” (Vañó-Cerdá 1990:â•›5).
However, this position must be clarified as suggested by Varela and Martín García:
Los verbos reversivos con des- pueden englobarse en dos grupos. Por un lado,
están los verbos que no suponen una acción previa, por lo que la reversión se
manifiesta mediante la oposición léxica que se establece entre el proceso denotado
por la base y el significado por el verbo prefijado (descontar, decrecer, desheredar).
Por otro, están los verbos complejos que entrañan la acción o el estado previo
que denota la base (deshacer, descalzar, desencuadernar). Con el fin de que pueda
establecerse la oposición entre las acciones en este último caso, la acción Â�
no-
reversiva representada por la base debe llegar a un punto final, es decir, debe
indicar un proceso perfectivo o télico que suponga un cambio de estado sobre el
que operará la acción reversiva para anularlo y volver al estado previo de donde
parte la acción descrita por el verbo simple.  (Varela & Martín García 1999:â•›5029)
ïœ²ïœ³.â•… This interpretation is, nevertheless, quite arguable too: “La interpretación de algunos
verbos [de ‘ausencia’] se considera polémica porque, si se los examina con atención, se
Â�
comprueba que no denotan simplemente la ausencia de cierta acción. En efecto, las omisiones
se asimilan a las acciones cuando expresan actos intencionados, aun cuando puedan com-
portar ausencia de actividad. Se ha observado que el uso de desobedecer está, por esta razón,
más restringido que el de no obedecer”. (R.A.E. 2009: § 10.10o).
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ·ïœ±
Therefore, the meaning of the verbs that act as bases must be susceptible to create
Â�
reversal: “[…] los verbos reversivos con des- deben denotar acciones perfectivas o
Â�
télicas, es decir, acciones que culminan en un resultado y, del mismo modo, los Â�
verbos
simples también tienen que indicar acciones delimitadas aspectualmente” Â�
(Martín
García 2007:â•›
11). This means that all semantic variants with these characteristics
can work both as verb bases in this process and as outputs of the process: ‘creation’
(deshacer [to undo]), ‘modification’ (descoser [to unstitch]), ‘result’ (descodificar [to
decode]), ‘possession’ (desabastecer [to not provide with sufficient supplies]), ‘com-
munication’ (desdecir [to deny]) (cf. Martín García 2007:â•›11–12).24
However, according to Haouet, “no todas las bases télicas admiten esta Â�prefijación,
como es el caso de los verbos de creación o simplemente los que implican un objeto
‘nuevo’, no existente previamente: *descrear o *despintar. Ello se debe a que la rever-
sión sólo es posible cuando no afecta a la existencia misma de tal objeto.” (Haouet
2000:â•›427).
As expected a great number of reversive verbs use causative denominal or
Â�
deadjectival verbs ending in -izar as their base (despolitizar [to depoliticize],
Â�descolonizar [to decolonize], descentralizar [to decentralize]…), precisely because they
adapt perfectly to the aspectual characteristics mentioned.
For the same reason, and because the formation process of parasynthetic
denominal verbs beginning with a- and en- with perfective-telic aspectual values is
so productive, these bases are also very often selected by the prefix des- to form the
corresponding reversal verbs: cajón > encajonar > desencajonar (drawer > to put in a
drawer > to remove from a drawer); nudo > anudar > desanudar (knot > to tie a knot
> to untie a knot).
It must be observed that many of these verbs allow two different but related inter-
pretations depending on whether they imply previous actions or previous situations:
Puede entenderse que desaparcar un vehículo es ‘realizar la acción contraria a la
de aparcarlo’ […], pero también que es ‘hacer que deje de hallarse en el estado
en que se encuentra (es decir, aparcado) […]. Cabe observar, en el mismo
sentido, que es posible que desaparezca algo (des-aparecer) que no ha aparecido
previamente; basta con que exista o que esté presente. (R.A.E. 2009: § 10.10t)
ïœ²ïœ´.â•… “Al igual que los sufijos,los prefijos requieren ciertas propiedades semánticas de las bases
a las que se adjuntan. En el caso de las bases predicativas, la selección semántica suele tener
relación con el aspecto léxico o Aktionsart. Por ejemplo, ciertos prefijos verbales sólo pueden
unirse a verbos perfectivos, como el prefijo des- con valor reversivo (descoser) […]. Por el
contrario,los mismos prefijos con distintos contenidos significativos pueden seleccionar bases
verbales imperfectivas; así el prefijo des- negativo (desobedecer)”. (Varela & Martín García
1999:â•›5009).
ïœ²ïœ·ïœ²	 David Serrano-Dolader
The same can be said of verbs such as desnacionalizar [to denationalize] and
Â�
deshumanizar [to dehumanize].25
3.1.3â•… Evaluation: desgobernar ‘gobernar mal’ [to govern incorrectly]
This kind of values, certainly a minority among the formations that now concern us,
are normally labelled intensifiers (desecar [to dessicate], desgastar [to wear out]) and
it is normally said that “expresan rasgos intensivos añadidos al contenido de la base,
a veces como refuerzo de la significación” (Martín García 2007:â•›13). I do not believe
that this specification is altogether adequate: the meaning of desgobernar [to govern
incorrectly] does not intensify the content of the base gobernar [to govern]; nor does
deslavar [to wash something lightly] add intensive features to the content of lavar [to
wash]. In any case, if we were to talk about a reinforcement of meaning it would be
limited to clearly colloquial formations such as desinquietar [to disquiet] and descam-
biar [to return a purchase]. In short, I believe that it is more appropriate to label the
expressive nuances present in these verbs evaluative instead of intensifiers; after all,
‘intensification’ is but a variant of ‘evaluation’.
From a general point of view, it can be said, as Varela and Martín García point out,
that “para que un verbo pueda intensificarse debe denotar una situación durativa, de
modo que la intensificación afecte a la realización del proceso o al estado, por lo que
se descartan de los procesos de intensificación las acciones puntuales que se producen
sin un proceso previo” (Varela & Martín García 1999:â•›5024). However, the almost lexi-
calized property of most of these verbs, their rare presence in Spanish and the lack of
productivity of the underlying word-formation process mean that we cannot produce
specifications of any interest regarding the base selection criteria applied here by the
prefix des-. As a matter of fact, the evaluative values that these des- formations can
present do not seem to stem from the prefix itself, but they would rather be considered
lexicalized values that are not directly deducible from the morphological structure.26
ïœ²ïœµ.â•… This behavior is not restricted to verb formations beginning with des- because, for
example, a very similar situation can be observed with a great deal of verbs formed using the
prefix re-. Thus, many verbs beginning with re- allow interpretations that are either reiterative
(‘repetition of a previous action’) or restitutive-reintegrative (‘restitution of a previous state’):
El general reagrupó sus tropas [The general regrouped his troops]. Regarding this matter, both
for verbs beginning with re- and with des-, see R.A.E. (2009: §§ 10.6s and 10.10t).
ïœ²ïœ¶.â•… Torres Martínez (2006) offers a historical overview of the study of the intensive value
of the prefix des- in Spanish academic lexicography. With the information found in this
work, the infrequent character of this “intensive” value among Spanish verbs and its lack of
Â�
productivity are confirmed. Regarding some of the peculiarities of the“intensification” of Â�
des-
in Â�
comparison with other “intensifying” Spanish prefixes, see Costa (2008:â•›274–275).
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ·ïœ³
3.2â•… Denominal verbs27
We are looking at verbs such as desnatar [to skim] and desratizar [to exterminate rats],
that is, parasynthetic formations built directly upon noun bases. As already Â�mentioned,
a lot of these verbs allow a double reading and, consequently, two lexicogenetic
Â�
analyzes, whether as deverbal prefixed verbs with a reversive value (descaminar < des
+ caminar), or as parasynthetic denominal verbs with a privative value (descaminar <
des + camin(o) + ar). I am now going to focus exclusively on parasynthetic denominal
verbs (regardless of whether, in a non-excluding way, they are also able – or not – to
allow the other lexicogenetic interpretation). This means that the verbs to be analyzed
now are built directly upon noun bases, so long as we do not take into account – for
the matter that now concerns us – their possible value of reversal of a previous action.
Thanks to the different semantic values that parasynthetic denominal verbs show,
I can offer some guidelines regarding the selection of noun bases for derivation.
3.2.1â•… Privative verbs: descabezar ‘quitar la cabeza’ [to remove the head]
The explicative periphrasis for the meaning of these verbs is ‘to remove N from X’ (i.e.
‘to remove something or someone’s head’). Therefore, “el sustantivo base establece
una relación de posesión con la entidad que se constituye como el complemento del
verbo” (Martín García 2007:â•›15) (i.e. desdentar: [to remove someone’s teeth]). From
this we can derive, as a very general selective restriction that is hardly restrictive at
all, that any possible base selected in this derivational process must fulfil the require-
ment of being considered a ‘part’ of a ‘whole’ (i.e. teeth are part of a person, a head
is part of the body…). More restrictive – and thus, more relevant for marking base
selection processes – is to consider, as already mentioned, that most of these verbs are
created from elements that are inalienably possessed. This is the same as stating that
the bases must denote entities which are likely to be considered inalienably possessed.
In order to develop this selective restriction one should, therefore, evaluate the – ever
controversial – concept of inalienable possession, although this is beyond the scope of
this study.28
ïœ²ïœ·.â•… See Serrano-Dolader (1995:â•›
127–143; 1999:â•›
4716–4723) for a more detailed account
– not included in this paper – on denominal and deadjectival verbs beginning with des-
(i.e. parasynthetic verbs) as well as a complete list of references.
ïœ²ïœ¸.â•… It is worth mentioning at this point Brea’s characterization of the Latin prefix DIS-:“[…]
DIS-, EX-, etc. son fundamentalmente dinámicos, están marcados en cuanto al tiempo: lo que
interesa en ellos es indicar, no que ‘falta algo’, sino que ‘falta algo que había o debía de haber’”.
(Brea 1980:â•›
127). This statement seems to contrast with Montero Curiel’s viewpoint when
studying, within the topic of negative prefixing in Spanish, formations beginning with des-:
“[…] no resulta acertado hablar de los valores estático o dinámico,temporal o no temporal del
ïœ²ïœ·ïœ´	 David Serrano-Dolader
There are much less common cases, in which it has been shown that the creation
of a verb rests on a non inalienable possession (verbs such as deslechugar [to rid of
lettuce and other weeds] and descamisar [to peel]). These verbs do not allow strict
selection criteria. Nevertheless, it is likely that some of these verbs should be reinter-
preted as showing an operatively inalienable possession; for example, in the case of
descamisar it can be argued that the base camisa (literally meaning ‘shirt’) does accept
an inalienable possession (it is relevant here to add that, in Spanish, we say “Me quito
la camisa” and not “Me quito mi camisa”, in the same way as we would say “Me duele
la cabeza” instead of “Me duele mi cabeza”).
The fact that in the case of nouns that denote inalienable possession the
Â�
corresponding verb without des- does not exist (i.e. we can not say orejar [to ear],
Â�
cabezar [to head], plumar [to feather]…) could support possible selection Â�
restrictions
for the bases of these verbs beginning with des-. However, the operativity of this
Â�
restriction is in any case linguistically arguable, partly because the verb formation
without des- could morphologically be a possible word (although it does not exist), and
partly because the fact that verbs such as orejar, cabezar and plumar do not exist seems
to be due to matters related to extralinguistic knowledge as opposed to Â�
linguistic
Â�morphological processes.29 In any case, rather than stating that in Spanish we cannot
say orejar, cabezar and plumar, we should specify that they cannot exist if our inten-
tion when creating these verbs is to conform the meaning ‘action of possessing X in
an inherent or inalienable manner’ (that is, the verb plumar [to feather] may not exist
in the sense of ‘inherently possessing feathers’ but it does exist with the meaning, for
example, of ‘putting feathers on someone or something’).
From a different point of view, we must not forget the close relation that can be
established between the reversive values studied above and the privative values we are
now analysing. In the words of Haouet: “[…] la interpretación privativa difiere [de
la reversiva] sólo en que no existe un verbo base sin prefijo, de modo que el objeto
base expresa la naturaleza del cambio de estado que afecta a un objeto dado” (Haouet
2000:â•›427).
On the other hand, we now ignore the fact that many of the verbs that are
Â�
generically classify as privative may in fact have developed – when joining the lexical
prefijo des-, sino que des- significa en la actualidad ‘no’, es decir,‘negación’ o ‘privación’ de una
raíz; las otras connotaciones pertenecen, precisamente, a esa raíz o al contexto sintáctico, sin
olvidar la historia individual de cada vocablo.” (Montero Curiel 1999:â•›132).
ïœ²ïœ¹.â•… Regarding the applicability in linguistics of “extralinguistic” or “cultural” aspects
that can make certain formations more or less acceptable, please refer to the discussion
on this topic of the acceptability of the verb cafeinar [to caffeine] (base of descafeinar? [to
decaffeinate]) and ratizar [to rat] (base of desratizar? [to de-rat]) in Costa (2008:â•›147–148).
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ·ïœµ
dynamism of the language – a more intensive value (that is why they are Â�
sometimes
called “privative-intensive verbs”, see Vañó-Cerdá 1990:â•›
12–13): descaderar ‘to
Â�
seriously injure someone’s hips’, desriñonar ‘to seriously hurt someone in the kidney
area’, Â�
desojarse ‘to damage one’s sight due to working too hard’, etc.
3.2.2â•… 
Resultative or effective verbs: desmigar ‘hacer migas el pan’ [to turn bread
into crumbs]
These are verbs such as destrozar [to destroy] and despedazar [to tear into pieces].
Their meaning is that of ‘an action whose result is constituted by the noun base’: ‘to
break X into pieces, bits, crumbs…’. Note that Martín García (2007:â•›16) rightly points
out that “frente a otros verbos derivados resultativos de este tipo (trocear, fragmentar),
los formados con des- añaden al significado resultativo un sentido de destrucción”, to
cut a sausage [trocear] is not the same as to destroy a sausage [destrozar]). In the words
of Costa, they codify a sense of “disgregation” (Costa 2008:â•›249) or “dispersion” (Costa
2008:â•›270–271).
As far as base selection is concerned, it is to be expected that those nouns that
explicitly denote a part of a whole (i.e. sections, divisions or elements separated from
a larger single or homogeneous unit) are suitable candidates to generate this type of
verbs: pedazo [piece], fragmento [fragment], cacho [bit], pieza [part], miembro [mem-
ber], porción [portion], sección [section], gajo [segment], rebanada [slice], Â�
loncha
[slice]…30 As already said, the formation (or not) of possible parasynthetic verbs
beginning with des- is helped (or hindered) by the possibility of interpreting (or the
need to codify) the ‘destructive’ sense already mentioned. It seems, then, that regard-
less of the actual existence of verbs such as rebanar [to slice] and desrebanar [also ‘to
slice’], the speaker has the power to unequivocally show that it is the second verb, not
the first, that aims for a more, let us say, ‘destructive’ sense.
3.2.3â•… Ablative verbs: desquiciar ‘sacar de quicio una cosa’ [to unhinge
or to drive mad]
This type of verbs use as their base nouns that represent a place or point where the
action originatesand they can be paraphrased as ‘to move (to remove, to extract)
Â�
something or someone (away from, out of) the place or object designated by the
noun base’: desbandarse [to abandon], descarrilar [to derail], despistar [to confuse],
Â�desquiciar [to unhinge], desterrar [to banish], desorbitar [to send out of orbit], destronar
[to dethrone], desgargolar [to remove something from its slot]… We must also include
ïœ³ïœ°.â•… “[…] la base léxica a la que se adjunta [el prefijo des-] denota alguna totalidad compuesta
de partes. Cuando se cumple esta condición, la palabra prefijada designa la fragmentación de
esa totalidad en sus componentes”. (Costa 2008:â•›270).
ïœ²ïœ·ïœ¶	 David Serrano-Dolader
in this group a small number of formations that present significant Â�
characteristics of
their own (‘to throw something downwards form above’): derrocar [to overthrow],
despeñar and desriscar [to go over a cliff].31
At first sight, it seems clear that – for ablative verbs – any possible selected base
should be characterized as being a possible container from which to extract Â�something
or someone.32 Nevertheless, since the characterization as an ‘object or place Â�
marking
an initial limit of an action’ is very imprecise and, deep down, could represent a great
variety of noun bases, the selection restrictions derived from this point are rather
few. We must also observe that many of these verbs, when they are lexicalized, tend
to Â�
mitigate their locative value. For example, nowadays verbs such as despistar [to
Â�confuse], destronar [to dethrone] and desquiciar [to unhinge] are more frequently used
with other values that are not entirely locative. This tendency towards non-Â�
locative
lexicalization makes it even more difficult to reach conclusions that might shed some
light on the possible base selection restrictions of the prefix des-.33
3.2.4â•… Instrumental verbs: despinzar ‘quitar con pinzas’ [to remove using tweezers]
The meaning of these verbs can be paraphrased as ‘to carry out an action with the
help of an object designated by the noun base’: despinzar [to tweeze], deslumbrar [to
dazzle], desbarrar [to throw a metal pole], desgarrar [to tear]. Even when the seman-
tic characterization of the noun bases (i.e. ‘something that is an instrument or can
be used as one to carry out an action’) is so vast that it does not, at first, seem to
follow restrictions, quite on the contrary, it is a virtually unproductive verbalization
ïœ³ïœ±.â•… “En DESpeñar y tal vez en DESviar (lo mismo que enDESterrar),DES- parece haber asumido
algunos de los valores que eran propios de otros prefijos, ya que en DESpeñar indica‘tirar desde
o por una peña’ (es decir, ‘movimiento de arriba a abajo’), y en DESviar ‘apartar del camino
(vía)’. Ello es fácilmente explicable por la pérdida de rentabilidad que han Â�
experimentado otros
prefijos (DE- y EX-), y que ha provocado el que sus funciones hayan pasado a ser desempe-
ñadas por otros de mayor vitalidad (especialmente el mejor Â�
aprovechado de todos: DES-)”.(Brea
1976:â•›335). Furthermore, it is well known that for prefixing in general, the semantic values of a
prefix normally come from a single meaning content, often a Â�
location value. Following this line
of research, Varela and Martín García point out: “El valor locativo de ‘separación, procedencia’
(descarrilar, despeñar) puede derivar en la idea de privación (descamisar),negación (desobedecer)
o reversión (deshacer)”. (Varela & Martín García 1999:â•›5011).
ïœ³ïœ².â•… Furthermore,Spanish offers one single productive affix for the formation of Â�
parasynthetic
verbs with this value: the prefix des- (or de-). As a curious exception we could mention the
verb encarrillarse meaning ‘for a rope to come out of a pulley’.
ïœ³ïœ³.â•… Although her study focuses particularly on the analysis of adjectives beginning with
Â�Â�des- and in- (instead of verbs), Costa’s book should be consulted for problems related to
Â�
lexicalization in negative derivational processes, more concretely, the chapter entitled
Â�
“Transparencia y opacidad en la palabra compleja negativa” (2008:â•›351–373).
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ·ïœ·
process in Spanish. In this case, the restriction that operates is not so much related
to the semantic characteristics of the possible bases, but rather to the fact that, in
Â�
Spanish, this kind of instrumental value is normally conformed thanks to other alter-
native Â�
verbalization processes, whether they are simple denominal verbs (dinamitar
[to Â�
dynamite], Â�
guillotinar [to guillotine]), or by means of parasynthetic verbs that
select a prefix a- or en- (abarrotar [to cram], abotonar [to button], empernar [to bolt],
enganchar [to hook]…).
3.3â•… Deadjectival verbs
Deadjectival parasynthetic verbs beginning with des- constitute a somewhat
Â�
heterogeneous group of a very varied productivity in Spanish. Furthermore, as shown
later, there is no agreement as to the lexicogenetic characterization of many of these
formations.
Due to the characteristics of adjectival bases, it is only natural that when they
are verbalized the goal is to create causative values with an adjectival base. Causative
Â�
verbalization processes in Spanish are normally marked by parasynthetic Â�
formulas
that select other prefixes, such as a- and en-, particularly with the formula [a +
Â�adjective + ar]: abobar [to stupify], achatar [to squash], achicar [to shrink], Â�
adensar
[to thicken], afinar [to tune]… If on top of this we add that the prefix des- is much
more semantically marked than a- and en-, it seems clear that, in this case, it does
not seem relevant to set selection restriction guidelines when choosing possible
Â�derivational bases.
However, it is convenient to add some specifications regarding two groups of
parasynthetic deadjectival verbs beginning with des-.
3.3.1â•… 
Resultative or effective verbs: desfear ‘desfigurar las facciones, afeándolas’
[to deform features, making them more ugly]
TherearesomeexamplesofparasyntheticdeadjectivalverbswitheffectiveorÂ�resultative
values: desfear [to make something or someone look ugly], despaladinar [to explain],
deslaidar [to disfigure], desflaquecer [to thin]…, all of which are rarely used nowadays;
depauperar [to impoverish], delongar [to lengthen], denegrir [to blacken]…, all clearly
Latinate formations.
In short, it is a process of no productivity in present day Spanish and, consequently,
it is not likely to reveal selective or restrictive guidelines regarding derivational bases.
3.3.2â•… Privative verbs: desbravar ‘amansar, hacer perder el carácter bravo’
[to tame, to make less fierce]
Within this group of verbs, which can be paraphrased as ‘to cause someone or some-
thing to lose the quality (state, relation, shape, etc.) expressed by the adjective base’,
ïœ²ïœ·ïœ¸	 David Serrano-Dolader
those with the verb ending -izar seem to be the most relevant. This is a Â�particularly open
group when it comes to receive new entries from various fields (technical, Â�
scientific,
artistic). In fact, the derivational formula [des + adjective + izar] is one of the most
productive for creating parasynthetic verbs in Spanish: deslateralizar [to Â�
delateralize],
despoetizar [to make less poetic], despersonalizar [to depersonalize], despolitizar [to
depoliticize], desdramatizar [to dedramatize], desoficializar [to make unofficial],
descentralizar [to decentralize], desmoralizar [to demoralize]. This kind of verbs are
always susceptible to double structural analyzes, from a semantic point of view (rever-
sative or privative values) and from a formal point of view (prefixed Â�structures or para-
synthetic structures). In all of them it is possible to explain their Â�
derivational structure
either directly through the adjective base (personal > des + Â�
personal + izar) or through
a previous verb (personal > personalizar > des + Â�
personalizar). If the parasynthetic
deadjectival character of these verbs is accepted, which is something I have defended
but not many other researchers share, then we would be looking at an incredibly
Â�
productive process and, more importantly for the matter at hand, subject to very few
selection restrictions for possible derivational bases.
In my opinion, verbs such as desbravecer [to tame] and deshumedecer [to
Â�dehumidify] should be treated in the same way as the examples that follow the formula
[des + adjective + izar], with which they share the possibility of a double interpretation
and double analysis.
Finally, there are examples of parasynthetic deadjectival verbs (i.e. whose base is
a noun derived from an adjective) with a privative value and which follow the formula
[des + adjective + ar] (that can sometimes also be interpreted as reversive verbs with
a verb base): desasnarse [to be educated], desbastar [to make less rugged], desbravar
[to tame], desacerbar [to moderate], desviejar [to separate older cattle], descabalar [to
lose part of a whole].34 In this case, it appears there should not be great restrictions for
ïœ³ïœ´.â•… Contrary to what normally occurs with privative denominal verbs (descabezar), in the
case of privative deadjectival verbs (desbravar) the concept of inalienable possession does not
seem so clearly operative. However, in relation to this we find that Haouet’s point of view is
very attractive for these two types of verbs and even for denominal ablative verbs (descarrilar
‘to derail’): “[…] hemos analizado el hecho de ‘quitar la propiedad base que caracteriza a un
objeto dado’ [desbravar, desbastar], de ‘quitar parte de un objeto dado’ [descabezar, deshojar]
o de ‘sacar algo de un lugar dado’ [desorbitar, descarrilar] como eventos que se enmarcan en
un tipo de relaciones en principio impropias. […]. Lo impropio de la interpretación de la
Â�
situación interna radica en el caso de los verbos de cambio de estado, en que un argumento
no adquiere una propiedad que se interpreta como inherente, de modo que si ‘se desbrava
un toro’, se le quita una propiedad que le identifica. A su vez, con un verbo de cambio aditivo
(o aquí privativo) como descabezar, la situación interna es impropia en su direccionalidad,
pues no se le puede añadir a un objeto una parte de sí mismo. Del mismo modo, si ‘un tren
se Â�
descarrila’ es que sale de su carril, es decir de un lugar que le es propio. De ahí el carácter
formal Â�
parasintético de los derivados con DES-”. (Haouet 2000:â•›428). (Highlighting is mine).
	 Base selection and prefixing	 ïœ²ïœ·ïœ¹
adjective base selection. Nevertheless, this contrasts with the little productivity of the
process. In our opinion, many are the causes that help explain this situation.
On the one hand, the process of creating causative verbs using formulas such as
[a + adjective + ar] is so deeply rooted in Spanish that verb formations like Â�
desviejar
and deschatar are usually rejected in this language. These would formally allow as
Â�
possible verbs, verbs such as viejar and chatar, which would clash with the already
existing and more likely forms aviejar and achatar.
On the other hand, many of the possible meanings around these possible
Â�formations like desviejar could sound natural in Spanish thanks to other different
Â�
verbalization processes. When it comes to creating the meaning ‘to make someone
less old’ or ‘to make something lose its fierceness’, it seems that in Spanish there is a
tendency to go for a more positive codification. This means verbs such as rejuvenecer
[to rejuvenate] and amansar [to tame] are preferred instead of the verbs resulting from
a merely reversive-privative process such as desviejar [to make less old] and desbravar
[to make less fierce]. In a way, we could think that, with restrictions that are hard to
specify, we have run into some kind of blocking seeing as the possible content that
many hypothetical Â�
formations beginning with des- would provide have already been
linguistically codified: *deslimpiar [to unclean] = ensuciar [to dirty], *desenfermar
[to make not ill] = sanar [to cure], *desllenar [to unfill] = vaciar [to empty], Â�*desampliar
[to unwiden] = reducir [to reduce], *desalegrar [to make unhappy] = entristecer
[to sadden]… (see R.A.E. 2009: § 10.10v). It is, however, an issue that remains open
for further discussion and that would require a more detailed study. Another subject
that would also require more attention is the fact that Spanish does not seem to use
the prefix des- to create verbs that come from other verbs with an adjective base, which
bring about changes of state that are interpreted as irreversible or irreparable: to what
extent can we consider a verb such as descegar [to cure of blindness] – in its most
likely compositional sense – to be existent, possible or impossible within our complex
Â�
network of word-formation rules?
This last question remains, at least for now, unanswered. In fact, with all my
Â�
reasoning I may have left more unanswered questions than solutions. But, perhaps,
this is to be expected of a study that intended to discuss matters that deserve more
space and more thought.
To sum up, I would like to add a short story written by Mario Benedetti called
Todo lo contrario ‘Quite the opposite’, in which a teacher and his pupil playfully test
each other’s knowledge of negative prefixing:
â•ﬁ
– Veamos ‒dijo el profesor‒¿Alguno de ustedes sabe qué es lo contrario de IN?
â•ﬁ
– OUT ‒respondió prestamente un alumno.
â•ﬁ
– No es obligatorio pensar en inglés. En español, lo contrario de IN (como
Â�
prefijo privativo, claro) suele ser la misma palabra, pero sin esa sílaba.
â•ﬁ
– Sí, ya sé: insensato y sensato, indócil y dócil, ¿no?
ïœ²ïœ¸ïœ°	 David Serrano-Dolader
â•ﬁ
– Parcialmente correcto. No olvide, muchacho, que lo contrario del invierno no
es el vierno sino el verano.
â•ﬁ
– No se burle, profesor.
â•ﬁ
– 
Vamos a ver. ¿Sería capaz de formar una frase, más o menos coherente, con
palabras que, si son despojadas del prefijo IN, no confirman la ortodoxia
gramatical?
â•ﬁ
– 
Probaré, profesor: «aquel dividuo memorizó sus cógnitas, se sintió dulgente
pero dómito, hizo ventario de las famias con que tanto lo habían cordiado, y
aunque se resignó a mantenerse cólume, así y todo en las noches padecía de
somnio, ya que le preocupaban la flación y su cremento.»
â•ﬁ
– 
Sulso pero pecable ‒admitió sin euforia el profesor.
(Benedetti, Mario (1990): Despistes y franquezas, Madrid: Alfaguara, p. 72)
I hope these pages, though perhaps pecables, may at least be considered sulsas.

Neologisms and Lexical Creation
Phonetic adaptation and derivational
morphological development of foreign
words in Spanish in the DPD*
Celia Berná Sicilia
Open University of Madrid
“The driving force of ‘deverbalization’ in a generic sense or in a
lexical-generic sense cannot be in the words as such, but in what is
preverbal, in thought”.
E. Ramón Trives (2011)
“A never-changing language could only be spoken in a graveyard”.
(F. Lázaro Carreter: 1997:â•›575)
This chapter analyzes the foreign voices which are included in the Diccionario
Panhispánico de Dudas (DPD). From the study it follows a kind of “chaos” in
the way in which foreign voices are adapted, from an orthologic, orthographic
as well as morphological point of view, probably due to the multiple factors that
intervene in this process. However, a sense of uniformity is also observed, in the
sense that the dictionary of the Real Academia Española tries to adapt the new
voices as much as possible to the graphic, phonetic and morphological patterns
of Spanish. In fact, there are a considerable number of foreign words which have
been totally absorbed by Spanish, to the extent that they have turned into truly
functional, productive elements in the target language.
Keywords:â•‡ foreign words; phonetic adaptation; derivational development;
morphological development
1.â•… Introduction
The lexical heritage of the Spanish language – like that of any other historical language –
does not represent a watertight compartment or a closed space with impassable Â�borders,
but, on the contrary, it constitutes a dynamic entity in constant growth.
*â•‡ Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas (RAE 2005).
ïœ²ïœ¸ïœ¶	 Celia Berná Sicilia
Thanks to the incidence of various neological processes, Spanish undergoes
Â�
processes of constant renovation that continuously enrich its patrimony. There are
two main types of mechanisms that adopt the appearance of new words: the Â�
so-called
Â�
internal neological processes – native processes generated within the internal frame-
work of the language itself, which are carried out by means of elements belonging to
that Â�
system (morphological and semantic mechanisms) –, and the so-called Â�
external
Â�
neological processes, i.e. procedures generated out of the limits of the language in
question, which are carried out with elements that do not belong to the system (loan-
words and foreign words, and ex-nihilo creations).1
In this research paper our specific aim will be to go deeper into one of these
ways of access for new words: loanwords and foreign words. In particular we will
carry out a brief approach to the words with a foreign origin which have a Â�
productive
Â�character and are listed in the Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas – from now onwards
the DPD (RAE 2005) –. We will also study, more thoroughly, the mechanisms that
these Â�
foreign words activate in the process of adaptation to the Spanish phonetic
and Â�
morphological rules.
The study of the foreign words that are more active in the generation of derivatives
in our language is essentially motivated by two reasons:
a.	 the consideration that they constitute better integrated elements in the system
that receive them.
b.	 the confirmation that, in them, the processes of internal and external neology are
simultaneously interrelated or combined.
In fact, this kind of lexical units are terms still perceived, to a greater or lesser
extent, as foreign elements – having a phonetic articulation and a graphic
representation Â�
distant from the parameters fixed in Spanish –, though they appear
along with words adapted to a certain extent, since they allow the formation of
derivatives thanks to the Â�
incidence of the internal mechanisms of word formation
in Spanish.2
Our aim will be, therefore, to analyze words of a hybrid character that are going
through this process of incorporation into the lexical wealth of the Spanish language.
We will also offer a characterization of borrowing as a source of constant renovation
of the lexicon and as an alternative neological procedure complementary to internal
neology processes.
ïœ±.â•… In this sense we agree with Almela (1999:19) when he points out that word incorporation
and word formation constitute the two major pathsbig ways of neology.
ïœ².â•… According to Hope (1971) and Gómez Capuz (1998:â•›
218), loanwords belonging to this
stage are in the third and last adaptation stage: the so-called “exploitation phase”.

2.â•… Preliminary terminological and methodological considerations
Before undertaking the specific analysis of the morpho-phonological development
of words with a foreign origin gathered in the DPD (RAE 2005), we are going to make
some terminological clarifications as well as giving some explanations related to the
Â�
methodology followed in this study.
There is widespread confusion – as is sadly quite common, in the field of linguistic
research – with regards to the terminology used in the field of lexicology to refer to
words with a foreign origin that are part of the lexical heritage of a historical language.
Some of the concepts that compete in this field of discussion are the termsforeign
word, loanword or borrowing and neologism. Despite the fact that these notions have
been frequently represented in the field of linguistic research as categories with fuzzy
limits, we believe that it is possible to establish a certain systematization in the classifi-
cation of the different phenomena that take part in these processes in order to facilitate
the research work, and with the aim of optimizing its results.
The first distinction we are going to carry out has to do with the delimitation of the
concept of neologism. In this approach we are going to consider, according to Gómez
Capuz (1998) and to the Obneo Protocol (2004), that the notion of neologism relates
to any newly-coined linguistic item in a particular historical language, regardless of
the type of mechanism used in its process of	 incorporation. Therefore, according to
our criterion, the neologism will involve the introduction of a new lexical element,
whether it is by means of the appearance or the incorporation of a new signifier, or by
the assignment of a new signifiedto a signifier already existing in the language.
Thus under this designation we include the new words coined by the incidence
of internal procedures (word formation and mechanisms of meaning extension and
projection), as well as those words originated by means of processes of external nature
(borrowings and foreign words).
This definition separates us from the restricted notion of neologism that links
it exclusively to more purely creative mechanisms (morphological processes of word
creation) and precisely from here our conception of borrowing emanates. According
to our approach, loanwords are a specific type of neologism resulting from the impor-
tation of linguistic items –predominantly lexical – from a source language (borrower
language) to one or some target languages (recipient language).3
In this way we hold that borrowing, as a source of constant renovation of the
lexicon, has to be considered as a neological procedure alternative to the processes of
internal neology, even though we admit that, as Gómez Capuz points out (1998:â•›46),
ïœ³.â•… In this respect we partially differ from Gómez Capuz’s assumptions (1998), who stated
that we can only strictly talk about borrowing when the transfer of lexical items occurs from
one language to another, the multilateral transfer not being possible.
ïœ²ïœ¸ïœ¸	 Celia Berná Sicilia
this procedure does not strictly fulfill some characteristics related to the Â�
neological
phenomenon, such as its eminently creative character: “Borrowing is a neologism
Â�
characterized by imitation (rather than by creation) and by the fact that it has a
Â�
different origin to that of the language that receives it” (Gómez Capuz 1998:â•›51).
We will also follow, in this paper, the integrative view adopted by Gómez Capuz
(1998:â•›13),sinceweconsiderthatthisspecialtypeofneologismhastobeÂ�simultaneously
characterized as a process and as an element in progressive integration in the system
of the recipient language.
The notions of borrowing and foreign words, in turn, do not establish great
Â�
differences regarding the process they represent in themselves. In both cases we are
talking about a clearly imitative phenomenon of importation and transfer from one
source language to one or various recipient languages. The differences operating
between both concepts are nevertheless gradual and not dichotomous. Thus Â�according
to what Seco stated (1989:â•›229), we can assert that borrowing and foreign word are
“two stages within the same adaptation process”.4
Most theorists coincide in pointing out that the foreign word is typified in the first
stages of integration of borrowing and, as a result, the frequency of use and its level
of integration in the recipient language determine, to a greater extent, the ascription
of the term to one category or to the other. This is the way Seco expresses it (1998:â•›33)
when he determines, according to his position (1989), that the difference between
Â�
foreign word and loanword is of a merely formal kind: it is determined by the degree
of formal assimilation (phonetic and graphic) to the rules of the recipient language.
Therefore, according to what we have established we can set up the following
Â�summary table:
Neologism
Type of neological mechanism
Internal External
Morphological procedures: formal
neologism.
Borrowings and foreign words: neologisms
from other languages adapted in a greater or
lesser extent to the recipient language.
Semantic procedures: semantic neologism.
For instance ‘pirata’, ‘piratear’.
Ex-nihilo creation
ïœ´.â•… Seco (1989:â•›229) distinguishes between those foreign words that our language has totally
assimilated into its system, words already “absorbed” by it – which are strictly speaking
Â�
loanwords – and those other words whose spelling or phonetic form make the speaker aware
of the fact that they are using a foreign word, terms that are not felt yet as “enclosed” in the
language: these are the foreign words.

Loanwords/foreign words in the DPD (RAE 2005)
Once we have established the pertinent theoretical aspects regarding the lexicological
questions under analysis, we will proceed to identify the productive borrowings and
foreign words in the DPD (RAE 2005) and we will give information about how the
process of integration of these words in the linguistic system of the Spanish language
has been carried out. In the analysis of the adaptation mechanisms of foreign words we
will specifically pay attention to:
a.	 The phonetic and graphical processes of adaptation.
b.	 The morphological adaptation processes: inflection and derivation.5
The review of the content of the DPD (RAE 2005) suggests that this first great volume
of academic Panhispanism includes about 7000 entries that attempt to give a solution
to a compilation of questions launched by the users of the Academia and channeled
through its web page.
A considerable amount of these questions from the users of the Spanish
Â�
language collected in the newest academic dictionary are related to words with a
foreign origin.
However, only some of these loanwords show creative potential by generating new
words in Spanish.6 In the chart below we can see which portion of the total informa-
tion compiled in the academic dictionary is devoted to giving information related to
borrowings or foreign words and how many of them prove to be productive once they
have been assimilated by the Spanish language.
In total, 9.17% of the contents (around 642 entries) correspond to information
related to loanwords and foreign words and only 10.74% of these compiled words with
a foreign origin (a total of 69 entries) have developed derivative words in Spanish.
ïœµ.â•… Even though we are aware of the fact that the semantic integration (restructuring of
Â�
semantic fields and specialization of meaning) is part of the last stages of the adaptation
process of a foreign word to a recipient language, the analysis of the adaptation mechanisms
of the foreign words in the DPD (RAE 2005), which show a productive character according
to the semantic rules of the Spanish language, will not be dealt with since it exceeds the
limits of the study.
ïœ¶.â•… As we have previously stated, the distinctive feature that characterizes every process
of introduction of a word with a foreign origin, is the progressive implementation of the
Â�
mechanisms of adaptation to the recipient language with the consequent confusion in the use
of the loanwords in discourse.The hesitation of speakers when they use this kind of neological
elements causes them to become a common source of users’ doubts, which have gained a
Â�
significant space in the DPD (RAE 2005).

Figure 1.â•‡ Productive borrowings and foreign words in the DPD (RAE 2005)
In this extensive and heterogeneous lexical collection we can find different kinds
of loanwords which have a different geographical and temporal location.7 Most of them
are already indexed in the last edition of the DRAE (RAE 2001), although the DPD
(RAE 2005) also includes some others that are not included in the DRAE, but which
are frequently used nowadays in American and Peninsular Spanish (RAE 2005:â•›19).
The productivity in the generation of derivatives from loanwords and foreign
words in Spanish is not excessively high in the light of the data collected from the
DPD (RAE 2005), but we consider it significant since, in most of the cases, we are
dealing with words recently added to our language. Furthermore, we believe that this
type of words deserve special interest, taking into account that they show, as we have
Â�
previously mentioned, a greater degree of integration in the grammatical rules dic-
tated by the recipient language and, as a result, it is possible to confirm their closeness
to the last stage of adaptation of foreign words: ‘the exploitation phase’. In this exploi-
tation phase the assimilated loanword is already felt as a patrimonial element and, as
such, it starts to be subject to the dynamic creative – basically neological – action of
the language (Gómez Capuz 1998:â•›218).8
ïœ·.â•… These are Anglicisms, Gallicisms, Italianisms and Teutonisms, exotisms, etc. that were
Â�
introduced into Spanish in different moments of History.
ïœ¸.â•… Gómez Capuz (1998:â•›219 and ff.), following Hope’s (1971) theories, develops his approach
around the process of adaptation of foreign words establishing different stages and sub-stages
in which two sub-processes are progressively carried out: (a) adaptation and integration (the
item is transferred, it accommodates to the phonic, morphological and semantic rules of the
recipient language and it gains diffusion and frequency of use; b) assimilation or Â�
naturalization,
in which the necessary but insufficient process of accommodation to the phonic, graphic,
Â�
morphological and semantic rules of the recipient language takes place.
	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development	 ïœ²ïœ¹ïœ±
In the following table we show those items within this special subclass of loanwords
and foreign words with a productive nature in the DPD (RAE 2005),9 of which the
phonetic and morphological adaptation is going to be analyzed.10
Table 1.â•‡ List of productive borrowings and foreign words11

As we will explain below, these loanwords and foreign words in the DPD
(RAE 2005) are shown as elements in progressive integration into the linguistic Â�
system
of the Â�
Spanish language (in gradual and successive accommodation to its phonetic
and Â�
morphological rules). We will analyze, according to what we have previously
Â�
established, how this process takes place in two of its most important dimensions:
a.	 Phonetic and graphic integration: disappearance of phonemes or distributions
unknown to the recipient language and replacement by other similar ones.
b.	 Morphological integration:
	 Stage 1: Assimilation to the grammatical categories of the recipient language and
its inflectional system.
	 Stage 2: Participation in derivative processes: combination of the lexical bases
with a foreign origin with native affix elements.
ïœ¹.â•… We should highlight that it is not always easy to determine when the term itself has
Â�
generated the derivative and when it is the result of a double importation from the source
language. Only by observing the etymological information facilitated by the dictionaries – in
case they include this information – and the data given by the Spanish corpora (mainly CREA
and CORDE), is it possible to establish it more accurately. In the dubious cases we will resort
to these sources to establish their origin more precisely.
ïœ±ïœ°.â•… We have excluded, in this list, names of places and people, since we consider them as
lexical elements with special characteristics.
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… The word‘bisnes’is not admitted in the DPD (RAE 2005).It is considered an Â�
unnecessary
foreign word, because there are other terms that can express the same in Spanish, such as
‘negocio’or‘actividad comercial’. However, the same could be said about other admitted terms
like ‘lonche’, since it also has substitute words and presents the same number of occurrences
in the CREA.
ïœ²ïœ¹ïœ²	 Celia Berná Sicilia
4.â•… Phonetic adaptation
The accommodation of foreign words to the phonetic forms of the recipient language
constitutes one of the most widely dealt with aspects in literature related to borrowings.
The analysis of the productive loanwords and foreign words in the DPD (RAE
2005) Â�
suggests the existence of a relative chaos in the adaptation of new words in the
Â�
orthological and orthographic field as a result of the multiplicity of factors that inter-
vene in this transfer: the path of access (written or spoken), the dynamic character of
the process (in constant progression and evolution), the usual practices established
by use, the interference of the idiosyncratic factors of pronunciation, or the setting of
linguistic fashions, among others.
The observation of the different solutions adopted in relation to the Â�
loanwords
and foreign words under analysis shows the general trend to reproduce the
Â�
articulation of words according to their pronunciation in the source language, even if
the Â�accommodation to the Spanish rules is carried out with the limitations imposed by
the phonetic-phonological system of the recipient language.12
Sometimes the original spelling and pronunciation are kept, as in the case of
fax, or blues (these foreign words are known as raw words and they present a great
Â�
international diffusion). Nevertheless most frequently the words of foreign origin
undergo some kind of modification and a process of adaptation, both on the graphic
level and, above all, on the phonetic level.13
We should bear in mind, in this sense, that the information related to the way in
which these words have to be pronounced included in the dictionary, however, is rather
sparing and scarce. The DPD (RAE 2005:â•›
17), as the DRAE (RAE 2001) has already
done,14 marks by means of italics the preservation of the pronunciation and the Â�spelling
of a foreign word: “the lemma of the articles appears in Bold Roman font, except in the
case of raw foreign words, whose lemma is in Bold Italics”.15 Moreover, in the Â�
phonetic
ïœ±ïœ².â•… Respecting the orthological rules of the Spanish language is an attempt to contribute
to giving a greater unity to the language, as well as helping to “preserve the high degree of
Â�
cohesion between graphic form and pronunciation that is typical of the Spanish language”
(RAE 2005:â•›19–20).
ïœ±ïœ³.â•… The DPD (RAE 2005:â•›
19) points out that the adaptation, to Spanish, of the original
Â�
-pronunciation or spelling is the most frequent phenomenon.
ïœ±ïœ´.â•… We should remember that the use of italics with a ‘distinctive’ character, to show that we
are dealing with raw foreign words, is a novelty introduced in the 22nd edition of the DRAE.
In these foreign words no correspondence occurs between the phoneme and the grapheme:
the loanword has not yet been adapted to the Spanish spelling, and the adopted articulatory
solution attempts to approach the model of pronunciation of the source language.
ïœ±ïœµ.â•… DPD (RAE 2005) distances itself here from other dictionaries of the Spanish language:
it Â�
sacrifices philological rigour and avoids the use of traditional systems of transcription used
	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development	 ïœ²ïœ¹ïœ³
annotations appearing in the entries of the raw foreign words, the conventional Â�systems
of phonetic transcription used in Spanish linguistics (IPA, RFE) are not used either.
In this way we can observe, for example, the differences existing between the entries
amateur and estrés [stress]. In the first case we find a raw foreign word and, as a result,
it would be necessary to make clarifications about its phonetic articulation, according
to the principles uttered in the DPD (RAE 2005); in the second case, however, the loan-
word has accommodated to the phonetics and pronunciation of the Spanish language,
so that, as in the case of the other patrimonial words, the phonetic information would
constitute, for the academic dictionary, a somewhat redundant piece of information.

NextwearegoingtoseesomeofthepossibilitiesthattakepartintheprocessofÂ�adaptation
of foreign origin words which constitute the object of our study. We will also deal with
the different phonetic mechanisms that are activated. The aim will be to overcome the
eventual articulation difficulties exhibited by these new words that have been taken from
other languages and introduced in the lexical heritage of the Spanish language.
We can talk in a generic way about the existence of general trends, both on
the orthological level and on the orthographic one, in relation to the guidelines
Â�
established by the DPD (RAE 2005). In this sense, the intervention of the general
Saussurian Â�
principle of analogy (applied to the phonetic level)16 seems to be decisive,
since the basic Â�mechanism operating in the process of phonic and graphic assimilation
of Â�
foreign elements is the replacement of foreign sounds and graphemes by similar
sounds and graphemes in the recipient language.
by linguists on the basis of the fact that the volume is not “necessarily directed to specialized
readers” (RAE 2005:â•›29).
ïœ±ïœ¶.â•… The presence of shift processes in this lexical subset (metathesis) is not observed.
ïœ²ïœ¹ïœ´	 Celia Berná Sicilia
The principle of analogy corresponds, on the orthological and orthographical
level, with the tendency to adapt words according to the phonetic and graphic patterns
of the recipient language.
Thus, in the field of pronunciation we observe a clear predisposition to the
Â�
reproduction of the articulation of the word, according to the pronunciation
model of the word in the source language, but with the limitations imposed by the
Â�
phonetic-phonological system of the recipient language; in this case, Spanish.17
	(1)	
Hippie> ‘jipi’: [hɪpi] (Engl.)> [xipi] (Sp.).
In the field of writing, an explicit preference for respecting the phonetic character of
the Spanish language (one-to-one correspondence 1, phoneme = 1 grapheme) is also
displayed, and, in addition, it is remarkable that the scale usually tends to turn in
favour of an adaptation of its or thographic rules.18
	(2)	
Croissant> ‘cruasán’.
Outside these general trends and by virtue of the pressure exerted by the principle of
analogy, we can observe the decisive incidence of more sophisticated mechanisms of
phonetic and graphic adaptation. More precisely, we have to highlight the application
of various addition procedures and different suppression procedures:19
	 A.	 Addition procedures
	 (a)	
Prothesis: phenomenon of addition of a sound at the beginning of a word.
A prothetic vowel is added to the base of the loanword in cases such as
‘estándar’ [standard], ‘esquí’, [ski] ‘esnob’[snob], ‘estrés’ [stress], ‘esprín’
[sprint], or ‘escáner’ [scanner].
ïœ±ïœ·.â•… The tendency to imitate the original pronunciation, although simplifying it according
to the phonetic rules of Spanish, can be observed, above all, if the introduction of the word
occurs through the spoken language. In this way, the foreign word or loanword passes to the
written language, practically as a phonetic transcription of the original word: bisnes (Sp.)
〈 (business), [bɪzɪns]〉 [bisnes], crol (crawl) [krɔ:l] > [krol]; glas (glace) [glas] > [glas]; glamur
(glamour) [glamuʀ] > [glamur]; jonrón (home run) [[həʊm rʌn] > [xonron]; zum, (zoom)
[zu:m] > [θum], líder (leader) [li:dər] > [liðer].
ïœ±ïœ¸.â•… In turn, the trend to identify each grapheme with a unique sound occurs above all if the
foreign word is introduced in the language through the written language. In these cases the
original spelling tends to be respected and the sounds of the source language are linked by
approximation to genuinely Spanish sounds, since the process that takes place is basically a
reading operation: dandi [dændi]; surf [sɜ:f] > [surf]; rugbi [rʌgbi] > [rugbi]; windsurf [wɪnd
sɜ:f] > [gwindsurf]; élite [elit] > [elite]; robot [rəʊbɒt] > [robot] (change of accent); complot
[komplo] > [komplot], flash [flæʃ] > [flas].
ïœ±ïœ¹.â•… On the other hand,it is also common in the phonetic accommodation of a word for more
than one of these processes take place.
	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development	 ïœ²ïœ¹ïœµ
	 (b)	
Paragoge: phenomenon of addition of one or more sounds to the end
of a word. A paragogic vowel is added both to the spelling and to the
Â�
pronunciation in: ‘chute’ [shoot], ‘bate’ [bat], ‘lonche’ [lunch], ‘breque’
[break]; only in pronunciation: ‘vampiro’ [vampire], ‘disquete’ [diskette].
	 B.	 Suppression procedures
	 (a)	
Syncope: phenomenon of suppression of one or more sounds in the middle
of a word: pícher [pitcher], escáner [scanner], grafiti [graffiti], rocanrol
[rock and roll].
	 (b)	
Apocope: phenomenon of suppression of one or more sounds from the
end of a word: campin [camping], parquin [parking], esprín [sprint],
estrés [stress], computador [computer], noquear [knock out], champán
Â�[champagne]. In the graphic form: glas [glace], cabaré [cabaret], crep
[crêpe] boicot [boycott].
	 (c)	 Monophthongation of diphthongs: voyerista (voyeur[vwaˈjœːʁ]).
In spite of the fact that the modifications made to foreign words seem to be characterized
by a relative lack of systematization, the truth is that, as Gómez Capuz (1998:â•›228) states,
“these changes are not ‘sporadic’, but they are conditioned by the phonotactic rules of a
system”. The phonetic and graphic alterations experienced by the words of foreign origin
introduced in our language therefore constitute “necessary accommodations”, caused
mostly by mechanical or automatic factors and they are not at all the result of eventual
and simple articulatory or graphic improvisations on behalf of language users.
5.â•… Morphological adaptation
Next we are going to explain how the process of adaptation of foreign words to the
morphological level is generated. In this task we are going to verify, first of all, how the
words accommodate to the inflectional forms of Spanish; then, we will analyze which
is the derivational behavior, when, once these words are consolidated in the Spanish
lexical repertoire, they become productive and use morphological procedures of word
creation to generate new lexical units. As we will see, again, analogy plays an essential
role in the morphological normalization of these words.
5.1â•… 
Inflection: Gender and number
5.1.1â•… Gender
In relation to gender, we observe that words of foreign origin included in our study,
except in some case in which there is some kind of hesitation, generally assign Â�
gender
without great difficulty and without infringing the morphological rules of gender
ascription in Spanish. On many occasions, in addition, since the loanword comes from
English – where there is no gender distinction –, the Spanish language enjoys a greater
freedom when fixing gender according to its peculiar morphological moulds.
ïœ²ïœ¹ïœ¶	 Celia Berná Sicilia
Almost all foreign items in our analyzed subset that possess gender inflection do
not admit gender variation. Furthermore, most of them posses an inherent gender
(RAE 2009:â•›
90), because they do not contain a specific inflectional morpheme for
Â�
gender inside their morphological structure.
In general, they usually end in a consonant or in the vowel -e and, therefore, they are
normally ascribed without hesitation to the masculine gender. In fact, there is only one
case of inherent feminine gender, making the etymological gender distinction: ‘la élite’.
In the lexical units under study, gender variation is a less frequent phenomenon,
but it is also possible, since only two nouns adopt specifically feminine morphemes
(-a and -esa): ‘talibán’ and ‘vampiro’ > ‘talibana’ and ‘vampiresa’.
In the same way, we must point out that the terms ‘esnob’, ‘pícher’, ‘líder’, ‘piloto’,
‘travesti’, and ‘jipi’ also admit feminine forms, although these nouns have a common
gender (they do not accept inflectional morphemes specific to the feminine gender):
‘el/la esnob’, ‘el/la pícher’, ‘el/la líder’,20 ‘el/la piloto’, ‘el/la travesti’, ‘el/la jipi’.
On the other hand, we should highlight that there is a registered phenomenon of
gender ambivalence regarding the words ‘crep/crepe’ and ‘computador/computadora’.
In the first case, it is due to essentially etymological reasons. In the source language –
French – the word crêpe is feminine, but its articulation in the source language ends in
a consonant and this favours its assignment to the masculine gender in Spanish.
With ‘computador/computadora’ something different occurs. The differences
between masculine and feminine take place in the diatopic axis. “Computadora” is the
most frequently used term in the most part of Latin America, while “computador” is the
common form in two countries on the other side of the Atlantic: Chile and Colombia.
5.1.2â•… Number
In relation to the inflection of number, we do find greater difficulties and hesitations
in the adaptation of foreign words. In the process of introduction of foreign words the
pressure exerted by the source languages on Spanish seems to be greater, especially in
the case of English. The result of this greater influence is that in many cases we can
observe that there is an infringement of the plural formation rules in Spanish.
According to the DPD (RAE 2005), the most frequent case in the construction of
plural forms of foreign words and loanwords is the introduction of the morphs -s and
-es, according to the rules established in Spanish.
However, the creation of the plural in forms with foreign origin does not always
respect the rules of the recipient language. There are, as we have been able to Â�confirm,
some examples of terms ending in a consonant – not all of them considered raw
Â�
foreign words – which fail to observe the plural formation rules of the Spanish
ïœ²ïœ°.â•… Only some countries in Latin America admit the feminine ‘lideresa’, generated through
a phonic increase.
	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development	 ïœ²ïœ¹ïœ·
Â�
language, because they have a plural ending in -s, when in principle they should form
it using -es: ‘amateurs’, ‘blofs/blufs’, ‘boicots’, ‘hándicaps’, ‘blogs’, ‘chats’, ‘links’, ‘zums’,
‘tests’, ‘robots’, ‘esnobs’.
In addition, we have to point out that the dictionary suggests the formation of
some plurals ending in -es for some words with a foreign origin, but that is not, at least
apparently, brought about by use, according to the data in CREA:
Párquines (0 occurrences) vs parkings (16 occurrences).
Campines (0 occurrences) vs campings (61 occurrences).
Cruasanes (9 occurrences) vs croissants (39 occurrences).
Esprines (0 occurrences) vs sprints (41 occurrences) or esprints (3 occurrences).
A particular case is that of the words ‘talibán’ and ‘grafiti’.21 In both cases the words
have been introduced into Spanish in plural, but the ignorance of Spanish speakers
has caused them to have been considered as singular nouns, and the same process of
Â�analogy has operated on them: adding -es and -s respectively, for their plural formation.
In the field of verbal inflection there are, however, less difficulties. When the
Â�
foreign element imported from a foreign language is a verb, it requires, as opposed to
substantives and adjectives, an immediate integration in the verbal paradigm in order
to be able to establish itself as an axis configurator of utterances.
The incorporation of these verbs to the Spanish verbal paradigm is made by
means of adding a verbal suffix element. These suffixes correspond in any case to the
first conjugation: -ar, -ear: ‘boxear’, ‘flirtear’, ‘chequear’, ‘dopar’, ‘zapear’, ‘driblar’, etc.
The verbal conjugation is carried out quite normally in these lexical units with a
mixed character, as is shown in the conjugator of the DRAE. Let us take for example

Derivation: Suffixation and hybrid forms
Lastly, we are going to undertake the study of the derivative developments carried out by
the loanwords and foreign words in the DPD (RAE 2005), since the capacity to generate
derivatives and the combination of foreign elements with the native ones that gives place
to hybrid formations constitute one of the essential factors taken into account when
assessing the maturity and/or assimilation of the loanword in the recipient language.22

use was exported, was not the nominative singular, but the accusative plural; the word ‘grafiti’,
in turn, is the adaptation of the Italian term ‘graffiti’, which is the plural of graffito (‘painting’).

Thisstagecalled“exploitationphase”wouldcorrespondaccordingtoGómezCapuz
(1998:â•›251) to the third and last stage in the process of incorporation of new words to
the lexical heritage of a particular historical language. Here, Â�
according to what this
linguist states, we could talk about borrowing, since it is then that the Â�
loanword, once
assimilated, “contributes to the exploitation and growth of the Â�
neological resources of
the recipient language”.
and of the maturity of the loanword is its semantic assimilation and the development of its
meaning extension: its capacity to generate new senses and to inscribe itself in figurative
Â�
environments or contexts.
	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development	 ïœ²ïœ¹ïœ¹
As we have already shown, the forms built from foreign elements are not
Â�
excessively numerous according to the data from the DPD (RAE 2005) – only 10.74%
of loanwords work as productive items in Spanish –, although they are significant to
us, since they reveal that the words have been already “digested” by the system and,
Â�
therefore, they are considered as native and fully functional items.
The analysis of the derivative formations of borrowings and foreign words in
the DPD (RAE 2005) suggests that suffixation is undoubtedly the most frequent
Â�procedure23 for generating new words (98.55%). Suffixation is rightly considered the
most Â�
productive additive mechanism of word-formation in Spanish: “by means of
this procedure new words have been created and continue to be constantly created”
(Almela 1999:â•›29).
Next we will see which are some of their preferences when combining with suffix
elements, as well as some examples. The derivative formations presented here are not,
in many cases, included in the DPD (RAE 2005), although their existence is docu-
mented in the Spanish reference corpora (CREA and CORDE), or in the most used
search engines (Google and Yahoo, with more than 2000 occurrences).
When the DPD (RAE 2005) does not give explicit information about the existence
of this derivative, we will mark it with an asterisk (*), and when it specifically rejects
its use – because it recommends the use of an alternative form instead – we will mark
it with an X (⊗)
First of all, we will pay attention to denominal suffixes – the most numerous – for
the generation of nouns and adjectives and, in second and last place, we will focus on
the denominal and deadjectival suffixes for the formation of new verbal forms.

The review of this data allows us to state that there are suffixes which are
Â�
particularly productive in relation to this kind of words. We are referring to two suffix
elements that are applied mainly to noun bases: -ismo (for the creation of new nouns)
and -ear (for the creation of new verbs).
It is not surprising, however, that both suffixes lead the formation of derivatives
in relation to the lexical units with a foreign origin, since they are also considered by
scholars as the two main affixes that take part in the generation of new words in order
to increase the lexical volume of the Spanish language (GRAE 2009:â•›439, 587; Pharies
2002; Rainer 1993; Pena 1980).
	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development	 ïœ³ïœ°ïœ±
In the light of the special disposition shown by loanwords in the DPD (RAE 2005)
with the use of -ismo and -ear in order to create new words, before concluding our
analysis, we are going to establish some precisions in relation to these suffixes and
we will also attempt to point out the main characteristic features of these subsets of
derivatives Â�
created from productive loanwords.
In relation to -ismo, it is remarkable to point out that Pharies, in his Â�
Diccionario
etimológico de sufijos (2002), states that it is one of the most productive suffixes in
Indoeuropean languages, especially at the end of the 18th century and during the whole
of the 19th century. This scholar calculates that the number of internal Â�
derivatives
(not inherited from the Latin tradition), generated thanks to this suffix, is about seven
Â�
hundred, although the catalogue of derivatives ending in -ismo in Spanish may be
even greater, in the light of the data offered by Rainer (1993) and by some French
Â�
dictionaries – the language that adopted the proliferation of the use of this suffix in
European languages from the 19th century onwards24 –.
As is well-known, the suffix -ismo creates new nouns that designate movements,
schools, systems, doctrines, etc. as the DRAE (RAE 2001) displays in the first sense of
this entry, and it also gives expressive support to scientific terms, sports activities and
human activities in general.25
The derivatives from loanwords in the DPD (RAE 2005) do not differ from
this Â�
typology and they are thus related to religious movements (‘talibanismo’) and
to human Â�
activities and behaviors (‘esnobismo’, ‘travestismo’, ‘voyerismo’, ‘jipismo’,
Â�
‘dandismo’, ‘elitismo’, ‘campismo’, ‘amateurismo’, ‘vampirismo’).
In turn, regarding -ear we must establish, first of all, that its prioritary use is
Â�especially significant, since the mediate derivation26 carried out by this suffix turns out
to be important both for the process of generation of new words27 and for the process
of adaptation of verbs with a foreign origin.28
ïœ²ïœ´.â•… The Trésor de la Langue Française Informatisé (TLFI) that considers the suffix -isme as an
‘extremely productive’ suffix – particularly in the first half of the 19th century –, accounts for
about 4000 terms generated from this suffix.
ïœ²ïœµ.â•… Although Rainer (1993:â•›
560) recognizes that the lexical subset of forms ending in -ismo
constitutes a heterogeneous group of derivatives, he considers the most numerous to be the one
that is related to political, religious, philosophical, scientific, or artistic positions or Â�
movements.
ïœ²ïœ¶.â•… Pena (1981:â•›
34) states that immediate derivation is carried out through the “simple
Â�
addition of the vowel of the conjugation theme”; mediate derivation, in turn, corresponds to
the process in which the vowel of the theme is preceded by another suffix.
ïœ²ïœ·.â•… -Ear is the suffix that creates the greatest number of new words, according to the data
taken from our analysis.
ïœ²ïœ¸.â•… We have already mentioned the preference for the use of the suffix -ear in the process
of morphological integration of verbs with a foreign origin, such as ‘chequear’, ‘chutear’ or
‘flirtear’.
ïœ³ïœ°ïœ²	 Celia Berná Sicilia
According to Pena (1980:â•›
77), -ear is a suffix with “a remarkable productivity
throughout the history of the language”. This vitality attributed to -ear is also pointed
out by Serrano (1999:â•›4690), for whom, thanks to the intervention of this affix, “the
creation of neologisms is frequent”, in spite of the fact that, according to this linguist,
its productivity changes by virtue of the type of verbs generated.29
The scholars seem to define the type of verbs formed with -ear as a relatively
homogeneous subset on the basis of the consideration of a series of common identity
features. In this way, as a general rule, they usually attribute to these verbs the feature
of iterativity as their main distinctive mark (Pena 1981:â•›79, 83; Serrano 1999:â•›4692).
Pena (1981:â•›
79) states that “a process is iterative when its execution involves
Â�
carrying out a successive series of acts. It is a process of unlimited internal duration,
but divided into units of finished duration within acts (…). Iterativity is, therefore, a
process considered as an extensive unit, as a series made up of minimal units, and of
acts of minimal duration”.
Nevertheless, this lexical subset does not represent a fully uniform verbal
Â�
category. There are differences, not always apparent or easy to determine, given the
difficulty existing sometimes in the delimitation of the lexical aspect (Aktionsart) of
this type of verbs (Pena 1981:â•›79; Serrano 1999: 4692). Thus, although in Â�
general terms
we can accept that the denominal derivation ending in -ear implies iterative values, it
is Â�
necessary to make some clarifications and to establish some differences among the
members that make up this verbal class.
Pena (1981:â•›83) and Serrano (1999) point out distinctions as regards these verbal
lexical units. They mainly distinguish two big subclasses: clearly iterative verbs like
‘martillear’ and frequentative verbs like ‘alardear’ (verbs that indicate frequency of use
and that express repeated actions, but always as a new process).
These two authors also clarify matters regarding some verbs whose meaning is not
at all iterative (‘ladear’, ‘colorear’), as well as in relation to other verbal formations, in
which we observe other values such as instrumentality (‘taconear’, ‘telefonear’) or the
locative value (‘hornear’), more significant than the mark of iterativity itself.
As occurs in the rest of the verbs that make up this subset of derivatives ending in
-ear, the type of verbs derived from the loanwords in the DPD (RAE 2005) by means of
this suffix do not constitute a fully homogeneous subset either. We can regroup these
hybrid lexical verbal units, created through morphological processes of word creation
on foreign bases of derivation, in different subsets from the theoretical distinctions
made by scholars in this field of study.
ïœ²ïœ¹.â•… Serrano (1999: 4690) specifies that “while the creation of iterative verbs ending in -ear
is frequent in Spanish (…) the productivity is reduced to a minimum, for example, when
forming causative deadjectival verbs (like ‘blanquear’,‘falsear’ or ‘redondear’)”.
	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development	 ïœ³ïœ°ïœ³
Thus, we can talk, within the framework of our lexical subset, of iterative verbs
like ‘zapear’, ‘boicotear’, ‘driblear’, ‘jonronear’, ‘bloguear’ and ‘rocanrolear’; of iterative
verbs with a feature of instrumentality, such as ‘faxear’, ‘flashear’, ‘glasear’, ‘brequear’,
‘bloquear’, ‘batear’, ‘escanear’, ‘zoomear’, ‘chatear’ and ‘testear’; of frequentative verbs
like ‘bisnear’ y ‘blofear’; and, finally, of non-iterative and non-frequentative verbs like
‘chartear’, ‘parquear’, ‘pilotear’, ‘surfear’ and ‘linkear’.
Finally, we do not want to conclude our brief approach without mentioning that
the phenomenon of the creation of new verbs ending in -ear seems to go much beyond
the small limits of the DPD (RAE 2005). There are many foreign words – mainly nouns
– that have nowadays adopted the appearance of a considerable amount of verbal
Â�
neologisms, perhaps propelled by analogy.
The tendency or predisposition towards derivation using -ear in foreign words is
a phenomenon that is taking place both in Spain and in Latin America. However, the
priority use of this suffix turns out to be more remarkable overseas, due to the greater
influence exerted by English in this Spanish speaking area,30 and due to the manifested
preference that, according to Serrano (1999: 4690), is shown by the Spanish spoken in
America for these mediate formations, in contrast to the immediate formations that
are more frequent in European Spanish (for instance ‘guiñar’ vs ‘guiñear’; ‘arbitrar’ vs
‘arbitrear’, etc.).
Let us consider, as a representative sample of the abundance of neologisms Â�created
from this suffix and from the generalization of its use, some records of these new words
with a hybrid character recently created and found on Google; the most used search
engine in the world:31

6.â•… Conclusions
The analysis made of foreign words and loanwords in the DPD (RAE 2005) has allowed
us to go deeper into the mechanisms of adaptation of new words, and to observe their
Â�
virtual productive potential. This leads us to state that borrowing is an important
active source for the extension of the Spanish lexicon.

	 Phonetic adaptation and derivational morphological development 	 ïœ³ïœ°ïœµ
The examination of the lexical subset in the DPD (RAE 2005), which has been the
object of our study, suggests the existence of a relative chaos in the adaptation of new
words in the orthological, orthographical and morphological fields as a result of the
multiplicity of factors involved in this process:
â•ﬁ
– The path of access (written or oral).
â•ﬁ
– The dynamic character of the process itself (in constant progression and evolution).
â•ﬁ
– The pressures of normalization.
â•ﬁ
– The usual practices established by use.
â•ﬁ
– Idiosyncratic factors related to pronunciation.
â•ﬁ
– Linguistic fashions.
However, despite the fact that the analysis of this type of entries allows us to infer that
some inconsistencies may appear – such as the slightly arbitrary decision of maintain-
ing certain foreign words and hispanicising36 others, the non-inclusion of some kinds
of derivatives, although they are endorsed by use,37 or the hesitation in the formation
of the plural –, we must recognize, in the light of the data found in our brief approach
to this special kind of lexical elements, the existence of certain doses of harmony and
ïœ³ïœ¶.â•… This is the case of some terms that have great international extension (rock and roll,
parking, camping, croissant or glamour). Only time will tell, however, if all or only some of the
adaptations suggested in the DPD (RAE 2005) as an alternative to the foreign word will be
Â�
successful and will finally be accepted by most of the Spanish speaking community.
ïœ³ïœ·.â•… It is especially remarkable that the DPD (RAE 2005) shows some inconsistencies in relation
to the introduction of the derivatives created from loanwords, especially if we take into account
the fact that one of its general principles is “founding its judgements and assessments on the
norm truly in force in current Spanish […] thanks to the technical resources that the Academy
has nowadays and, in particular, its Spanish data bank” (RAE 2005:â•›
14). In fact, there seems
to be some arbitrariness in their recommendations when they explicitly warn against the use
of Â�
particular linguistic units (such as ‘chartear’, ‘handicapar’, ‘esponsorizar’, ‘windsurfista’ or
‘surfero’), informing of the existence of other patrimonial terms that can replace them. The
Â�
consideration of these forms as unnecessary borrowings does not seem to be a very solid
Â�
argument, since other terms like ‘brequear’ or ‘driblar’ are registered in the dictionary, and
also have specifically Spanish forms to designate the same realities (‘frenar’ and ‘regatear’,
Â�
respectively), and their use is either not documented in the CREA (like ‘brequear’), or is quite
limitied, according to the data from the corpus (like the case of ‘driblear’, which only Â�
registers
15 occurrences). On the other hand, the DPD (RAE 2005) shows arbitrariness when it does not
warn of the existence of some derivatives generated by the foreign elements. It is possible that
Â�
sometimes it may be due to the fact that these are considered as well-known formations,familiar
to Â�
everybody (like‘batear’),but in other cases it does not seem to be justified,because words like
‘grafitero’ (2 cases), ‘boicotear’ (224 cases), ‘linkear’ (1 case), ‘parquear’ (7 cases) or ‘surfear’ (21
cases) are not included in the DPD (RAE 2005), although they are documented in the CREA
with equal or superior values to other loanwords, and they are also well represented in Google.

relative uniformity in the process of incorporation of the words with a foreign origin
from the Spanish language.
The solutions adopted by the DPD (RAE 2005) allow us, in general, to talk about
a Â�
certain degree of homogeneity and coherence, since, from the normative point of
view, the academic volume attempts to accommodate the foreign words to the graphic,
Â�
phonetic and morphological patterns of the Spanish language as well as possible.
The words which are in the process of integration in our language prove a Â�
gradual
and progressive accommodation to the phonographic and morphological rules of
Spanish. Good proof of it is the fact that a significant number of words with a foreign
origin have already been fully ‘absorbed’ and ‘assimilated’ by the Spanish language, and
they have succeeded, therefore, in becoming productive and fully functional elements
in our language.

From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-
Aspects on semantic evolution in verb formation*
José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
University of Alicante
This chapter deals with verb formation concerning both sobre- and super- in
Spanish and Latin, respectively. It is proposed a cognitive link between the
different meanings shown by the prefix sobre- in verb formation processes.
The difference between Spanish and Latin as regards the distribution of meaning
is evident: while local meanings are the most frequent in Latin, non-local
meanings are the most abundant in Spanish; in fact, the following senses have
been detected: fictive movement, temporal location, excess, repetition, sudden
action, incomplete action, wider action, surpassing and non-physical location.
Nevertheless, it seems obvious that the local meaning constitutes the experiential
base of the rest; moreover, it is argued that all notional meanings are accessible
via local ones.

1.â•… Introduction
For some theorists, language changes because speakers make this change according to
their interests, needs, or communicative convenience; for others, language changes itself
almost mechanically, leaving the will or the interest of the speakers to play no role.
As opposed to positivist explanations of phonic changes as an obligatory result of
physical or physiological causes, functionalism holds that the evolution of Â�phonological
systems depends largely on the inherent features in the system. Thus, the more distinc-
tive features shared by a pair of phonemes, the easier it is for there to be a merger
between them, and therefore, the notion of functional performance of phonological
opposition has been used to account for some of the evolutionary trends: an isolated
opposition, consisting of phonemes that were opposed by an unrepeated trait in other

competitions, is more likely to be suppressed than if the opposition is based on a
repeated trait and is integrated in a correlation of other pairs also opposed to the same
trait. Discussion of functional explanations was carried out both by Â�sociolinguists such
as Labov (1994), and by linguists that somehow advocate a return to neo-grammatical
assumptions, such as Lass.
While functional explanations suggest that language changes because of Â�something
that speakers do, in Lass’ view change takes place because of something that simply
Â�
happens in language, in an almost mechanical and natural way. It is the language that
must necessarily determine the use made by speakers of some resources and not vice-
versa, and they can be represented by the image of a polymorphous population with dif-
ferent degrees of variability in different parts of its structure. There is no actual change
starter: since language has a varying population structure, change is simply the result of
the transmission over time of a subset of these variants, and any of them can be selected
in the evolutionary transmission and, in the case of peripheral variants, the path of
development would lead to a variant different from the current entity. Lass (1997:â•›336),
in opposition to leading theorists of language change (Anttila 1989; Keller 1990;
Vennemann 1993), states that approaches to language change explanations in terms of
action from speakers, functional motivation, unconscious rationality or cognitive objec-
tives are logically incorrect, always problematic and almost always empirically empty.1
However, linguistic evolution shows characteristics that set it apart from general
evolution: biological evolution is unpredictable, and any mutations which generate
variation depend on chance, natural selection being a deterministic process in them.
On the contrary, natural selection in linguistic evolution is a factor that cannot work. In
addition, in biological evolution, not all variants will be identically transmitted, because
the most common variants will always be more likely to be acquired by new speakers
which, if applied to linguistic evolution, would imply that central features of a language
system, the most frequent, should necessarily possess greater likelihood of transmis-
sion, also implicating postponing peripheral features, which are less common. This
would mean that more frequent traits would increase, without the possibility of a new
central core of variants, as is the case in biological evolution, and without the speaker
having the aim of strengthening the core elements of grammar, or make it more efficient.
However, we know that reality contradicts the facts presented, because often a language
evolves developing peripheral variants that lead to a new typologically different entity,
we know that changes sometimes involve the development of rare and scarce items,
and it is necessary to explain why the variant selection vector cannot be considered
purely random, meaning we have to establish some factor that influences and alters it.
ïœ±.â•… “I don’t believe that language change is the result of ‘human action’except in a very distant,
secondary and probably uninteresting way” (Lass, 1997:â•›337).
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ°ïœ¹
In the case of semantic evolution of the Latin super- to the Spanish sobre-, even though
examples are limited to verbal formations, we will largely check these phenomena.
The other relevant factor to be considered in order to explain these changes is
social reality. The distribution of variants may fluctuate according to different social
groups, which may not behave in a neutral manner when it comes to acceptance.
Â�
Linguistic variables acting as group markers appear in certain environments, but tend
to be extended to other new environments according to internal distinctions of the
language. In addition, social groups are not usually isolated, but there are intersections
between them, hence the linguistic traits linked to social variables being transferable
between them. Some of these aspects will be studied in our analysis, and we will offer a
distribution of the meanings of formations with the Latin super-: specialized meanings
are those that have developed most.

Semantic change and cognition
Interest in semantic change has been revitalized in recent years by cognitive Â�linguistics.
Some of the key themes of cognitive semantics, such as prototypicality, polysemy,
Â�
metaphor, metonymy and grammaticalization affect the synchrony-diachrony
Â�
interface. Moreover, Koch (1997) considers diachrony to be the empirical field of
Â�cognitive semantics.
Cognitive diachronic research has developed two main domains (Da Silva 2006):
(a) interest in regularity in the development of meaning has been renovated, and here
we highlight the study on grammaticalization (Cifuentes 2003), and several studies on
patterns and trajectories of conceptualization and lexicalization, as well as Â�dominant or
universal conceptual metaphors and other processes (Santos Domínguez & Â�
Espinosa
Elorza 1996); (b) the application of the theory of prototypes to lexical change processes
(Geeraerts 1997).
The interest of theoretical semantics operating within the scheme of cognitive
semantics in the study of meaning changes comes from its interest in polysemy, and
this is so because the synchronic links that exist between the different senses of a term
coincide with diachronic mechanisms of semantic extension, such as metaphors and
metonymy.
The senses of each sign form a radial category, in the sense used by Lakoff (1987),
with a central member (prototype) and links defined by transformations of image
schemas, metaphors and metonymys. Polysemy is a systematic relationship between
meanings and affects the cognitive organization of lexicon. Polysemy is a special case
of categorization based on prototypes where the senses of a word are members of a
category. Non-central senses cannot be predicted from central senses, but are not
Â�
arbitrary. They are motivated by central cases, image schema transformations and
metaphorical models.
ïœ³ïœ±ïœ°	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
Words do not freely acquire new senses. And, since new senses are acquired
through cognitive structuring, multiple synchronous senses of a given word are
Â�
usually related to each other in a motivated way. Considering the development history
of groups of related words, it will be possible to see what kind of systematic Â�
structure
leads our cognitive system to give relevant domains (Sweetser 1990:â•›
9): thus, the
vocabulary of physical perception shows systematic metaphorical connections with
the vocabulary of internal sensations. These connections are not free links, but they
are strongly motivated by ties between parallel or similar areas of internal and Â�
physical
sensations. They are not isolated links. Moreover, some aspects of these metaphors
affect all cultures alike – if they are not universal (for example the connection between
vision and knowledge) –, while others may vary between cultures.
The preceding discussion explains the idea that meaning is based on human
Â�
cognitive experience: experience of cultural, social, mental and physical worlds.
3.â•… Super-
The meaning of the Latin super- comes in opposition to sub. The Latin prefix Â�
super-
could be constructed in the ablative and the accusative cases. In the first case, the
locative character dates back to Lucretius and the prose writers of the golden age;
with the accusative, local meaning comes from all ages, while other values are lately
Â�
documented (Neira 1972).
Let us now examine lexical data on super- as a preverb in the classic and late Latin
periods. For this purpose we have scoured the information provided by the Oxford Latin
Dictionary (OLD: Glare 1980) and the Felix Gaffiot’s dictionary (1934). We have also
made some searches in Forcellini’s Lexicon totius latinitatis in its fourth edition (1965) to
check if documentation of a verbal form in this or that author depends directly on what
is edited in the text which has served as a reference for the preparation of the dictionary.
Thus, for example, superadduco is not documented in Gaffiot nor in OLD, but is
in Forcellini:
Superadduco, -is, -ere, a. 3. insuper adduco, “condurre di più”. Plaut. Truc. 2.6.53.
quot ancillae sunt jam? Quine etiam superadducas, quae mihi comedint cibum?
Alii leg. divisim super adducas.
Forcellini himself warns of the problem of edition and, indeed, Lindsay (OCT) edits
the following:
Ph. (…) paenitetne te quot ancillas alam,
quin examen super adducas quae mihi comedint cibum?
The two verses include conjectures of J. Gulielmius (quot ancillas alam), Haupt
Â�(examen) and Camerarius (comedint cibum). However, considering superadduco as
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ±ïœ±
a composition of duco or as the simple form plus a preverb is not a problem of
Â�
textual criticism, but is the editor’s responsibility, depending on whether he deems
the Â�
compound in question an old form. It is well known that in Homeric Greek
preverbal verbs are without welding, as regards the classical period. We can see an
identical situation in the editions used by Gaffiot and the OLD, in the sense that
editors are more likely to accept this type of compounds the later the period of the
author of the text. In conclusion, super- compounds are documented more often the
further we move on in time: examples in classical periods are relatively scarce, and
they are more abundant in the archaic period (Plautus). The editors are reluctant to
admit them in classical periods.
In the field of use and with regard to the linguistic register, the greater
frequency of usage is shown in the field of technical languages: encyclopaedism
(Pliny the Elder), agriculture (Columella, Palladius), cooking (Apicius), medicine
(Celsus).
OLD documentation covers up to the 2nd century AD, as well as some later
authors: Carisius (Grammarian, IV a.C.), Donatus (Terence commentator), some
authors of the Digesto (Florentinus, 3rd century), Fulgentius (mythographer, v-VI
a.d.),2 Isidor of Seville (Origines, VII a.d.), Macrobius (Saturnalia, late 4th), Nonius
Marcellus (De compendiosa doctrina, 4th century), Paulus Diaconus (Epitoma Festi,
VIII a.d.), Priscianus (Grammarian, 6th century a.d.), Servius (commentator of Â�
Virgil,
IV–V a.d.). Data for compounds with super- in this dictionary are as follows:

â•… – temporal:	 10
â•… – spatio-temporal:	 2
Recurrence/iteration:	3
Spatio-temporal – excess3	1

Félix Gaffiot’s dictionary has taken into consideration authors whose lists widely and
abundantly reach the VI century a.d. Accordingly, and in the light of this, the number
of entries in verbal compounds with super- is greater: 192. We can anticipate some
considerations. Firstly, the documentation is more abundant the later the authors.
Â�
Secondly, we note that these formations are associated with a technical register.
The total number of occurrences is distributed in the following manner:

Let us see some examples below. We have chosen one entry with an evolution towards
Spanish, supercresco >“sobrecrecer” (to overgrow). We found the corresponding entry
in the OLD.

Documented examples are collected in the Gaffiot dictionary. These are late texts

superfloresco “to re-sprout” (Plinius the Elder, I a.d.).
In conclusion, verbal compounds with super- in Latin are mainly documented in
the field of technical language (medicine, agriculture, enciclopaedism) and are more
Â�
frequently documented in late Latin.
4.â•… 
Sobre-
Sub- and super-, as prefixes (Neira 1972:â•›227), express ‘high’ and ‘low’: pono/subpono/
superpono. In imperial Latin sub- became widespread as a diminutive and, at the same
time, super- spread as a superlative indicator: admiro/superadmiro. The Latin system
continues in Romance languages with various alterations (Neira 1972). And, indeed,
the three basic meanings given in Latin are found in Spanish.
In current Spanish, sobre as a preposition for strictly spatial relations tends to
be displaced by other prepositions, such as encima [on top] or arriba, [above], using
sobre- especially for derived senses (hablar sobre política [to talk about Â�
politics]).
Sobre-, obviously, also has survived as a prefix. However, the massive penetration
of neologisms beginning with super- has forced their meanings to exclude the
Â�
superlative value. Indeed, Varela and Martín García (1999:â•›5013–5014), had already
indicated the value of ‘top position’, already real, as the highest place, or as referring
to pre-eminent space, as well as the meaning of excess. In the case of the Spanish
super-, it has sometimes a spatial value, but is primarily used with superlative or
excess value.
Alongwiththespatialvalue,anotherfundamentalmeaningforverbalÂ�compositions
with sobre- is the gradative, referred to intensive and evaluative uses. Varela and
Martín García (1999:â•›
5024) point out that intensity entails a more intentional,
emotional or quantitative quality of the word’s meaning content, so intensification is
part of the subjectivity of the speaker, and adds imprecise traits to the meaning of a
term. Since intensity depends on the subjectivity of the speaker, it is easy to deduce
that the intensification mode presents several variants. Similarly, the cited authors
indicate that verbs which support intensive prefixes mostly denote imperfective or
atelic actions (sobreestimar [to overestimate]), in some cases states (superabundar
[to superabound]), and perfective actions (sobreexplotar [to overwork]). This means
that in order for a verb to be intensified it must denote a durative situation, so that
Â�
intensification affects the realization of the process or the state. Thus, in verbs, Â�
sobre-
as an intensive prefix refers to the process of the action (sobrecargar [to overload]),
which, according to Varela and Martín García (1999:â•›5026), explains that there are very
few stative verbal formations with intensive prefixes.
ïœ³ïœ±ïœ´	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
The last meaning indicated by Varela and Martín García for verbal formations
prefixed with sobre- is the iterative meaning (1999:â•›
5028–5031). Iteration involves
aspectual modification of the verb, and the meaning that is added is that of successive
repetition with verbs that denote telic or perfective actions. Repetition of the action has
an impact on the outcome of the action expressed in the simple verb, so that the result
obtained with the prefixed verb modifies the previous meaning: sobreasar [to overcook]
or sobreimprimir [to overprint] express actions successively repeated in order to change
whatisalreadycookedortoprintonsomethingwhichhasalreadybeenprinted.Similarly,
the authors indicate that the iterative valueof the prefix Â�sobre- is not very productive, and
the examples we find have a reduced scope in the current synchronous phase of Spanish.
Thus, the three values organized for the Spanish sobre- revolve around the
Â�
meanings of localization, intensification and iteration, as in Latin.6 However, with
regard to considering verbal forms with sobre- as word formation processes like
Â�
composition, which can be interpreted as argument schemas of incorporation or
Â�
syntactic-semantic conflation, Val Álvaro (1999:â•›
4776) also mentions another value
not given by the above authors: sobre- can add the meaning of ‘lightly, partly’, as in
sobrebarrer [to sweep superficially].
All this leads to the following thought: we saw that the majority of Latin verbs
Â�
analyzed are surprisingly given spatial values, making other meanings rare and a
minority.
The situation in Spanish is markedly different, essentially because of two reasons:
(a) distribution of meanings is very different, and contrary to what is stated in the
introduction, in the conversion of Latin to Spanish, we see that core traits of the prefix
sobre- – the most frequent which are spatial – should have been those that, possess-
ing greater likelihood of transmission, should have had more success, thus deferring
the less frequent. However, as we saw in our analysis, it was not the case, because the
spatial meanings are practically reduced to the periphery. (b) New meanings appear,
as indicated by Val Álvaro, to mean ‘lightly’.
The provisional distribution of verbs and meanings found in Spanish is the
Â�following: 18 spatial values; 20 values of intensification, concerning the idea of ‘excess’;
13 values of iteration; and 3 values of ‘lightly’.7 With this preliminary classification we
simply see that the difference with the distribution of meanings in Latin is remarkable.
But we must also note that spatial meanings are oversized:
ïœ¶.â•… Interestingly, in the Nueva Gramática de la Lengua Española of the RAE, when classifying
prefixes according to their meaning (2009:â•›620), only two meanings are collected: (a) spacial
value (above), and (b) gradative and scalar value (excess).
ïœ·.â•… The distribution of meanings we make is according to the analysis of the RAE, which is
what we reproduce all through this paper.
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ±ïœµ
(a) One meaning that we have incorporated is not spatial in itself, but temporal
(sobrevivir8 [to survive]). If we have included it within this subset it is because, as noted
by Serrano-Dolader (1999:â•›4735), when speaking of prefixes that indicate direction or
spatial orientation, like sobre-, this value also includes possibly temporal or pseudotem-
poral values, insofar as they may be reinterpreted as locatives, indicating placement or
situation in time. The first thing that strikes us about this meaning is that, according
to the DRAE, it is an intransitive verb, in spite of the data confirming that it may be
Â�
transitive. Perhaps the explanation comes from Latin, where it was obviously intransi-
tive, because, in Latin, the person or thing that is survived appears in the dative.9 In
Spanish, however, that which is survived acts as a direct object:
	 (1)	
“Y el viudo o viuda que sobrevive al finado o la finada, podra goçar los bien”
(1530).
	 (2)	
“aunque ninguno moriesse en la tal batalla, el que sobreviviere al otro que
después que fuesse fallescid” (1540–1553).
According to Neira (1972:â•›
226), the temporal meaning is motivated by the spatial
meaning, because he believes that the position may involve immediate proximity
(closeness or contact) or mediate (distancing, transposition of a limit), the transitive
case (dative in Latin) being the one which would precisely indicate that transposition
of a limit. From space, it would easily go on to time, with parallel senses of Â�
anteriority,
simultaneity or – as in the case we are looking at – posteriority. Neira (1972:â•›
245)
points out that this meaning of ‘transposition of a limit’ is frequent in sobre-, which
we can better understand if we conceptualize that exceeding of the limit applied to
something notional, as with the values of intensification, where there are cases in
which something is above a certain limit (sobrealimentación [overfeeding], Â�sobreprecio
[overpriced]). Thus, we are facing a spatially motivated, temporal meaning: from
being above someone or something spatially, we move on to its application in time,
with the value, in this case, of ‘posteriority’. Meanings 2 and 3 of the DRAE are easy
ïœ¸.â•… (From Lat. superuiuĕre).
	 1.	 intr. Dicho de una persona: Vivir después de la muerte de otra o después de un
Â�
determinado suceso [For a person to live after the death of another or after a Â�
specific event].
	 2.	 intr.Vivir con escasos medios o en condiciones adversas [To live with limited means
or in adverse conditions].
	 3.	 intr. Dicho de una persona o de una cosa: Permanecer en el tiempo, perdurar.
Esa tradición sobrevive en las zonas rurales [Said of a person or a thing: to remain
in time, to persist].
ïœ¹.â•… Superuīuō ~uere ~xī, intr. [svper-+vivo] (w. dat.) To remain alive longer (than a person,
event, etc.): triginta annis gloriae suae ~xit Plin.Ep.2.I.2;
ïœ³ïœ±ïœ¶	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
to explain from this first temporal meaning. And contrary to Latin, where temporal
Â�
values are more common, in Spanish the conversion of ‘spatial sobre-’ to ‘temporal
sobre-’ Â�
meaning ‘posteriority’ is very limited.
(b) We have included sobreseer [to stay a case] under the subset of verbs with
spatial values, but actually it is not a spatial verb, though its motivation is spatial. The
meanings of the verb in the DRAE are as follows:
(Del lat. supersedēre, cesar, desistir).
1.	 tr. Cesar en el cumplimiento de una obligación pecuniaria.10
2.	 tr. Der. Poner fin, sin llegar a una resolución sobre el fondo, a un procedimiento
penal o sancionador.11
It has been included in the subset of spatial, although it is not per se, due to its
Latin formation. If we pay attention to Corominas and Pascual dictionary (1984),
supersedēre meant ‘to sit down before something’, ‘to refrain from something’,12 and
it is difficult to motivate the relationship between the spatial meaning and notional
meaning. However, if we take into account the meaning that is given in the OLD for
supersedēre, the explanation can be much easier, because no mention is made about
the spatial value of ‘to sit down before something’, but of ‘to sit on something’. From
this spatial meaning it is much easier to explain the motivation of other meanings
which survive in Spanish from Latin: if we are sitting on something, that ‘something’
is no longer visible, it is not (somehow) there, it is covered. Its implementation is made
easy by the meanings that survive in Spanish from these meanings.

(c) There are two verbs which we have included in this subset but, again, are
not strictly spatial, although they are spatially motivated: sobrecoger [to startle] and
Â�
sobresaltar [to frighten]. Already the RAE talks about the prefix sobre- having the
value of ‘sudden action’ and by way of examples shows the two previous cases. One
of the earliest examples we find in the CORDE can serve to adequately explain the
Â�
motivation of the outlined meaning:
	 (3)	
que esperaua de poder con aquella gente algún ora sobresaltar a los nuestros y
tomarlos en descuydo, (1528).
It is possible to understand the verb with a full spatial value as that paraphrasable by
saltar sobre los nuestros [jump out upon us]. Obviously if someone ‘salta sobre otra
persona’ [jumps on someone else], it must be a sudden action, and this can also mean
that the person affected by the action is altered or frightened, so non-spatial meanings
of the verb sobresaltar are metonymically explained.
In sobrecoger [to startle], the earliest examples do not show so clearly the
Â�
relationship between spatial meaning and notional meaning;13 however, and
Â�
especially from what we have shown above, if ‘se coge a alguien por encima, desde
arriba’ [if someone is taken from the top, from above], obviously the meaning has to
be ‘shocking and sudden’.
Thus, two verbs with non-spatial meanings (and which cannot be catalogued
within the meanings given to verbs with sobre-) can be explained and motivated from
fully spatial values.

ïœ³ïœ±ïœ¸	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
(d) We have also included the verb sobrentender [to understand] in the
spatial Â�
subset, and similarly to the cases above, the definition of the DRAE does not
justify it:
1.	 tr. Entender algo que no está expreso, pero que no puede menos de suponerse
según lo que antecede o la materia que se trata.14 U. t. c. prnl
We believe that spatial motivation is also clearly present, because something
is ‘sobrentendido’ (understood or inferred) if it is understood ‘above what is said’,
i.e. it is not within what is said, but nor is it hidden (occult elements are Â�
normally
Â�
schematized as inferiority or prospectiveness), but that it is what was said but
not explicitly, and a way to represent this idea is seeing it ‘from above’, as we also
Â�
communicate things ‘from below’. If inferred meanings are not exactly within what
was said, but rather taken from what is said, the spatial representation could be
‘above’ what was said. We must also remember the metaphor ‘to have control is
above’ (Lakoff & Johnson 1986:â•›52), with which ‘from above’ is a way to better under-
stand what was said.
Action from above

Therefore, actually the 18 examples of spatial meanings have been reduced to 13.
Instead of setting the examples as different meanings for the formations with sobre-,
we have preferred to explain them in a motivated way from the spatial Â�
meanings,
Â�
something that will also occur with the other 3 outlined values of intensification,
Â�
iteration and lightness. What it is more, as we will comment below, some of the 13
meanings that are included in location hold close relations with other meanings,
so one same verb can be included in two values, which will be greater proof of the
Â�
cognitive relational network between all the verbs formed with sobre-.

4.1â•… Uses with a spatial value
There are 3 cases of local intransitive verbs: sobreaguar,15 sobrenadar16 and Â�
sobresalir.17
Sobreaguar is a typical verb of argument conflation between verb, ground and path,18
i.e. what is usually called a location verb:19
	 (4)	
y de ambas partes los arracifes [sic] que sobreaguaban, *que son peñas como
puntas de diamante (1527–1561).
	 (5)	
á lo que contribuye la passion de este pescado á andar siempre cerca del fondo
y á no sobreaguar nunca. (1748).
Both the proposed example and the definition of the DRAE point out the double
Â�
possibility of understanding the verb as one of motion or location. In other words,
the verb could be paraphrased as follows; desplazamiento/localización sobre el agua
[motion/location on the water], the figure being the subject since it is an Â�
intransitive
verb. In Spanish there are many examples of this kind of verbs: Aballar Â�(desplazamiento
al valle [motion towards the valley], aportar (desplazamiento a puerto [motion towards
the port], expatriar [expatriate] (desplazamiento fuera de la patria [motion outside of

ïœ±ïœ¹.â•… The designation of locatum and location verbs, very successful in generativism, appears
to come from Clark and Clark (1979), and it is applied to those denominal verbs whose base
nouns are in objective case in clauses that describe the location of one thing with respect
to another, in the case of locatum verbs (1979:â•›769), such as to blanket, as would be proven,
Â�
according to Clark and Clark, in the relationship between the verb blanket and the noun
blanket in the relevant analytical paraphrase:
Jane blanketed the bed
Jane did something to cause it to come about that [the bed hat one or more blankets on it]
In the case of location verbs, the nouns would be in locative case (1979:â•›772):
Kenneth kenneled the dog
Kenneth did something to cause it to come about that [the dog was in a kennel]
ïœ³ïœ²ïœ°	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
the homeland], soterró el hueso [he buried the bone] (localización bajo tierra [location
underground]).
Sobrenadar and sobresalir imply an argument conflation pattern of verb and path.
In the case of sobrenadar, the verb would have a manner of motion value:
	 (6)	
los muy grandes cete como vallena algunas vezes enla fondura del mar
se alçan sobrenadando & muestran a desora tanta grandeza (1490).
	(7)	
que el agua salada sobrenada a la no tan salada, (1585).
I.e. its schema would be similar to desplazamiento sobre [motion on], nadar por enc-
ima de [to swim above]. As seen in the example above, it is a very common schema
in Spanish: introducir (desplazamiento al interior de [motion inside of]), expeler
Â�(desplazamiento fuera de [motion outside]).
Sobresalir is very interesting, because the base verb (salir [exit]) is a motion verb,
so it configures an argument conflation pattern of verb and path, but with a value of
what is called a fictive motion:20 desplazamiento fictivo por encima de [fictive motion
above], estar por encima de [to be above]:
Fictive
Motion
Sobresalir
Intransitive spatial action
Conflation of path
Sobreaguar
Sobrenadar
ïœ²ïœ°.â•… Talmy (1996:â•›
212–213) uses the factive-fictive terminological distinction in order to
Â�
indicate a cognitive assessment of greater likelihood, not its actual objectivity (factive), versus
the imaginative ability of cognition (fictive). In this sense he shall explore fictive motion,
usually in combination with factive stativity,understanding that the general schema of Â�fictivity
perhaps can be established in parallel on language and vision.
It is clear,and Talmy (1996:â•›269) recognizes it,that general fictivity matches the metaphor
and metonymy theory in cognitive grammar. The source domain and the target of a metaphor
serve two conflicting representations: the representation of an entity within the target domain
is understood as factive and more realistic; the representation of the source domain that is
drawn on the entity in the target domain is fictive and less realistic. Besides motion, stativity
can also have a fictive statute, both in language and in vision, and can be considered fictive
stativity in motion according to the schema.
In terms of the metaphor theory, linguistic fictive motion can be interpreted as the
drawing of motion as a source domain on stativity as a target domain. A drawing of this
type can be seen as a form of cognitive dynamism. Fictive stativity, then, is the opposite: the
drawing of stativity as a source domain on motion as a target domain. This, in turn, can be
understood as a form of cognitive statism (Talmy 1996:â•›270).
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ²ïœ±

onbre de los contrarios que se quiso aventajar, e sobresalir en alguna manera,
al qual dió la muerte (1453).
	 (9)	

sobervia y asi se promete (1474–1500).
Other verbs from this spatial subset are transitive. There are also distinct Â�
argument
conflation patterns which we will now go on to comment on individually:
Sobredorar (to gild): 1. tr. Dorar los metales, y especialmente la plata.21
2. tr. Disculpar y abonar con razones aparentes y sofísticas una acción reprensible
o una palabra mal dicha.22
	(10)	
dio e encargó un cáliz de plata sobredorado con su patena en que podría aber
fasta (1419–1426).
The argument conflation implied in sobredorar [to gild] is more complex than the
previous cases, because the verb is formed from dorar [to gild], which is attested
two centuries before sobredorar, and which, moreover, comes from the Latin deau-
rare, according to Corominas and Pascual (1984). Thus, argument conflation of dorar
would be something similar to poner oro en [to put gold on], cubrir con oro [to cover
with gold], i.e. a locatum verb where the figure (oro [gold]) is conflated in the verbal
schema. Combining dorar with sobre- emphasizes the significance of ‘el oro’ [the gold]
having to be above the ground, i.e. that it is a layer of gold.23
Sobrehilar: 1. tr. Dar puntadas sobre el borde de una tela cortada, para que no se
deshilache.24
	(11)	 para que no se deshilache, sin necesidad de sobrehilar. (1995).
The sobrehilar conflation pattern is a locatum verb with a conflation of figure and path:
localización de hilo por encima de [location of thread above]. The peculiarity of this
verb is that it does not apply to any part of the material but, since we are looking at
stitches on the edge of a piece of material, it refers to edges or ends, which, somehow,
are above the rest of the material.
ïœ²ïœ±.â•… To gild metals, and especially silver.
ïœ²ïœ².â•… To apologize and justify with apparent and sophistic reasons a reprehensible action or
an incorrect word.
ïœ²ïœ³.â•… The second meaning that the DRAE offers is very interesting, since it is motivated from
the spatial meaning: from the idea of putting something valuable on a base that has less value,
extending the same relationship to notional content, in the sense that we decorate the ground
(the reprehensible action in this case) with appealing words.
ïœ²ïœ´.â•… To sew the edge of a cut thread to prevent it from fraying.
ïœ³ïœ²ïœ²	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
Sobreimprimir: 1. tr. Impr. Imprimir algo sobre un texto o sobre una imagen
gráfica.25
	(12)	
y, sobre todo, apretar, sobreimprimir sobre este corazón, y su esperanza, los
corazones de las más jóvenes generaciones (1996).
As we can see from the definition and example, this is a verb with a conflation pattern
of path. It differs from those seen above because it is obviously transitive, which means
that the subject is the action agent, the figure is the direct object, and the ground
Â�
reappears preceded by the preposition sobre- (or any local preposition).
Sobrellavar: 1. tr. Poner sobrellave a una puerta, especialmente por virtud de
mandamiento judicial.26
As we can see from the definition of the DRAE, this is not a verb formed by Â�prefixation,
but it is a verbal derivative on a nominal base (sobrellave [second lock]) formed by a
prefix and a noun. Therefore, the argument conflation which it would entail would
be localización de sobrellave en [location of a second lock on]. In any case, we must
remove this example from the subset that we are looking at, since it is not a case of
verbal formation through prefixation.
Sobrellevar: 1. tr. Dicho de una persona: Llevar encima o a cuestas una carga o
peso para aliviar a otra.27
2. tr. Ayudar a sufrir los trabajos o molestias de la vida.28
3. tr. Dicho de quien los padece: Resignarse a ellos.29
4. tr. Disimular y suplir los defectos o descuidos de otra persona.30
5. tr. desus. Dispensar o eximir de una obligación.31
	(13)	 él sea bien seruido e el Reyno lo pueda sobrellevar (1406–1411).
The argument conflation pattern is of motion and path: desplazamiento encima [motion
above]. As occurs with transitive verbs, the subject is the agent and the Â�
figure is the
direct object, but this verb has the peculiarity that the base seems implicit, because it
is the agent itself. This affects the verbal schema in that the base, instead of indicating
the target of motion, indicates manner: ‘llevar encima o a cuestas [to carry or hold].
On the other hand, this is very common with verbs of motion combined with stative
ïœ²ïœµ.â•… To print something on a text or a graphic image.
ïœ²ïœ¶.â•… To put a second lock on a door, especially by virtue of a court order.
ïœ²ïœ·.â•… To carry or hold a load or weight to relieve another person.
ïœ²ïœ¸.â•… To help suffer work or troubles in life.
ïœ²ïœ¹.â•… For he who suffers these troubles: to resign himself to them.
ïœ³ïœ°.â•… Disguise and make up for defects or negligence of another person.
ïœ³ïœ±.â•… Waive or exempt from an obligation.
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ²ïœ³
paths introducing the ground: venía encima de la moto [he came on top of the bike],
where we can see that the ground indicates not the target of motion but the manner
of motion of the agent (Cifuentes 1996). Non-spatial meanings of the verb are very
simply linked with the spatial meaning, because results of the action are possible: it
is clear that whoever carries a weight or load, suffers or endures such a load, and can
even resign himself to it.

	(14)	 Allí Diomedes sobrepasó en correr a Tirses y a Merión, (1442).
	(15)	 No sobrepasar esa normativa (1607).
This verb also conflates motion and path, desplazamiento por encima de [motion
above]. The particularity of the verb is the ground, which is the direct object, the
Â�
subject being both the agent and figure of motion at the same time, it is not usually a
spatial object, hence the meaning that Neira talked about; i.e. ‘going over a limit’.

ïœ³ïœ²ïœ´	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
It is a verb of location and path conflation pattern, like sobreimprimir: localización sobre,
encima de [location on, above]. The subject is the agent of the action, the direct object is
the figure, and the ground has been introduced by the preposition a, Â�
differing from the
example seen in sobreimprimir, that had been followed by with the Â�
preposition sobre.
Already Neira (1972:â•›225) said that the meaning of ‘subordination’ or Â�
‘domination’ was
linked with time and place, and indeed that is shown in the Â�
non-spatial meanings of
sobreponer, cognitively linked to spatial meaning in that, if something is locally ‘above’
something else, it can be understood also in a notional way as ‘superior’, or ‘dominating’.
Sobrescribir: 1. tr. Escribir o poner un letrero sobre algo.37
2.â•… tr. Poner el sobrescrito en la cubierta de las cartas.38
	(17)	
Dar libros a los príncipes o es ambición de sobrescribir la obra con magníficos

	(18)	
Séneca dijo de la casa de un hombre delicioso y bestial que se había de
Â�
sobrescribir en ella: Hic jacet Batia (1642–1648).
It is, as in previous cases (but differs because it proceeds from Latin: superscribĕre), a verb
with argument conflation of location and path (localización sobre, encima de [location
on, above]), in which the subject is the agent, the figure is the direct object, and the base
has been introduced by the preposition en, as in the second example of Gracián. The first
example is exactly the same as the second, with the particularity of syntactic-semantic
alternation where the ground appears as the direct object and the figure has been intro-
duced by the preposition con: sobrescribir magníficos títulos en la obra [to write magnifi-
cent titles over the work]. The second meaning that the DRAE mentions is linked with
what was said regarding sobrehilar, because sobre- in this case has the clear meaning of
‘end’, ‘top’, visible in the very definition of the notion of sobrescrito: ‘Text written on the
envelope or on the outside of a closed piece of paper to indicate the address’.
Sobresolar1: 1. tr. Coser o pegar una suela nueva en los zapatos, sobre las otras que
están ya gastadas o rotas.39
	(19)	 Ya sé yo que sois de solar, y aun de sobresolar. (1574).
The verb is formed by solar, ‘echar suelas al calzado [to add soles to footwear]’, which
is already present in the origins of the language:
	(20)	 Los zapateros, por solar denles IIII dineros (1234–1275).
Therefore, it is a locatum verb with argument conflation of figure (suela [sole]) and
path (sobre [on]): localización de suelas sobre [location of soles on]. As usual with this
type of verbs, the ground appears as the direct object.
ïœ³ïœ·.â•… To write or put a sign on something.
ïœ³ïœ¸.â•… To put the writing on an envelope.
ïœ³ïœ¹.â•… Sewing or gluing new soles on shoes, the soles of which are already worn or broken.

Sobrevolar: 1. tr. Volar sobre un lugar, una ciudad, un territorio, etc.40
	(21)	 han regresado las golondrinas que vuelven a sobrevolar el asfalto (1961).
As well as sobreaguar or sobrenadar, this is a verb with argument conflation of path,
although in this case, and unlike the previous ones, it is of motion (sobrenadar could
mean both motion and location): desplazamiento sobre, por encima de [motion over,
above]. The subject is the agent and the figure of motion, and the base acts as a direct
object.
Therefore, in conclusion, there are 12 spatial verbs formed in Spanish with the
prefix sobre-, resulting in a much smaller percentage than in Latin. On the other hand,
apart from logical cognitive relations that keep all meanings of sobre- together, we must
consider that some uses which we have identified as spatial could also be Â�
understood
with an intensification or iteration value, which helps to further highlight, if possible,
the relational network of the meaning of sobre-.

Uses with an intensifying value
This is the most extended meaning of verbs beginning with sobre- in Spanish. It
implies, in all cases, an estimative quantification of the intensification of an action
understood as an excess, as regards the figure affected by the verbal action, either the
subject, if the construction is intransitive, or the direct object, if the construction is
transitive.
ïœ´ïœ°.â•… To fly over a place, a city, a territory, etc.
ïœ³ïœ²ïœ¶	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
Intransitive examples are less common, and we find the following cases:
Â�
sobreabundar, sobrebeber, sobrecrecer, sobresalir and sobreverterse.
Sobreabundar.
1.â•… intr. Abundar mucho.41
	(22)	
“E dize el Apóstol: “Donde abundó el delito, ende sobreabundó graçia.” Pues
sy donde abunda pecado, que es defecto del ánima, ha sobreabundado e puede
sobreabundar la graçia, ¿por qué no sobreabundará donde abundan las otras
defetuosydades e pasiones corporales, como éstas no sean pecado?” (1450).
It is easy to see the value of ‘excess’ which quantifies the verbal action and is conflated
through the prefix.
Sobrebeber.
1.â•… intr. Beber de nuevo o con exceso.42
	(23)	
sobre si bebe poquito, y sobre si sobrebebe, Mascaraque el de Sevilla
(1610–1645).
We found few examples of this verb in the CORDE. However, not only is it included
in the DRAE, without examples, as we have just noted, but also in the María Moliner’s
dictionary (1998), with the same meaning: ‘Beber otra vez. Beber en exceso’.43
Not wanting to mix sobre- as a prefix and as a preposition, it should be noted that
in the 16th century, it was easy to find examples of beber combined with a Â�prepositional
complement introduced by sobre:
	(24)	
y con esto queda maravillosa la materia de las indulgencias con la bendición
de la mesa y con el beber sobre dar gracias (1589).
	(25)	 Halo de beber sobre comida y no ha de beber otra cosa. (1576–1577).
In both cases, the value of the verb is not intensifying, but temporal, of posteriority, in
that the drinking takes place “encima de otra cosa, es decir, después [on top of some-
thing else, i.e. afterwards]”. We do not mean that the first meaning is that of iteration,
although it is easy to understand the link between previous values and the meaning
of ‘beber de nuevo [drinking again]’, because if you ‘drink on top of what has already
been drunk’, there is an iteration. On the other hand, we must take into account that
in the 16th century there existed the verb beberrear [to drink a lot], so the intensifying
meaning of excess may have been covered. What we do want to say is that cognitively
there is a link between ‘drinking on top of what has already been drunk’ and its logical
outcome: ‘to drink excessively’.
ïœ´ïœ±.â•… To be very abundant.
ïœ´ïœ².â•… To drink again or excessively.
ïœ´ïœ³.â•… To drink again. Heavy drinking.
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ²ïœ·
Sobrecrecer.
1.â•… intr. Exceder en crecimiento o crecer excesivamente.44
	(26)	
Et a tal uertud que si la molieren & pusieren della en llaga que aya carne
sobrecrecida; tuellela (1250).
	(27)	
guardando desde ahora, i para siempre, el órden literario, como se declara,
cuando los frutos, rentas, i acrecentamientos sobrecrecieren (1538).
	(28)	 Alarbian, vn animal aquátil; y la carne sobrecrecida en la nariz (1606).
It seems easy to think of an evolution of meaning from Latin, with spatial and adding
values,45 to the current value of excess, and more so if we consider that the verbal base
(crecer [to grow]) implies the idea of an ‘increase’: putting on top > more is above >
more=excess.
Sobresalir.
1.â•…
intr. Dicho de una persona o de una cosa: Exceder a otras en figura, tamaño,
etc.46
2.â•… intr. Aventajarse frente a otros, distinguirse entre ellos.47
	(29)	
él con los suyos se tornó al real sin resçibir daño alguno, e sin lo fazer, salbo en
aquellos que quedaron atajados e presos, e en un solo honbre de los contrarios
que se quiso aventajar, e sobresalir en alguna manera, al qual dió la muerte
Fernando de Ribadeneyra. (1453).
	(30)	
y, segund esto, todo sobresalir se puede llamar sobervia (1474–1500).
It might seem from the examples that the second meaning has motivated the first.
However, we find very early examples of the first:
	(31)	
Et tu porque fust bien andant que vençist a edom sobresalio tu corazon.
(1300).
	(32)	
“Tanto fue sobresalido aquel fraile en su baladrear, a que el Rey –- le fizo
señas–- que callase”. (1453).
	(33)	
“Boluiendo como señora/El su gesto y continencia./La yra, sin reuerencia,/Le
sobresale a desora” (1424–1520).
The meaning of ‘intensification’ is in this verb actually something different from
the others, since it is not something that ‘salga en exceso [occurs excessively]’, but
Â�
something that ‘sale por encima de los demás [stands out above the rest]’, with the
result or outcome that it is emphasized, excessive or ahead.
ïœ´ïœ´.â•… To exceed in growth or to grow excessively.
ïœ´ïœµ.â•… Supercrescō ~escere ~ēuī, intr. [svper-+ cresco]. To grow on top of a surface (in quots.,
med., of morbid tissue). b (transf., w. dat.) to develop as an addition (to).
ïœ´ïœ¶.â•… To exceed others in figure, size, etc.
ïœ´ïœ·.â•… Overwriting others, to be distinguished among them.
ïœ³ïœ²ïœ¸	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
Sobreverterse.
1.â•… prnl. Verterse en abundancia.48
For this verb we could not find examples or proof of its existence in the CORDE,
CREA, Corominas & Pascual, and Cuervo. However, the DRAE (RAE 2001) includes it,
as in the previous example, and so does María Moliner: ‘Rebosar. Verterse en exceso’.49
All this makes us think that it is a fairly recent formation, which follows the pattern of
most common formations with sobre-: ‘acción en exceso [action carried out excessively]’.
Sobreactuar
1.â•… intr. Dicho de un actor o de una actriz: Realizar una interpretación exagerada.50
2.â•… intr. Exagerar la expresión al actuar ante alguien.51
	(34)	
Rudy Carrie, excelente actor, vivaz actor, caluroso y risueño, incluso con tenden-
cia a pasarse y sobreactuar, inundó el espacio de simpatía y cordialidad, (1977).
	(35)	
Lo mismo que a los intérpretes se les perdona, en el caso de Tommy Lee Jones
su tendencia a sobreactuar, (1983).
Similar to the case above, sobreactuar seems a recent formation – and is also Â�
collected
by María Moliner.
We found many more transitive verbs. In all of them, the argument conflationÂ�pattern
is an intensive quantification with the value of ‘excess’, as regards the verbal action without
sobre- applied to the direct object, which is the object affected by the action.
Sobrealimentar.
1.â•… tr. Dar a alguien más alimento del que ordinariamente necesita para su
manutención. U. t. c. prnl.52
2.â•…tr. Mec. Inyectar en un motor más combustible o de mejor calidad para
incrementar su rendimiento por encima de lo normal.53
	(36)	
Como ya indicábamos anteriormente, el pienso se puede dar con un doble
carácter: o para suplir el alimento herbáceo o para sobrealimentar (1966).
	(37)	
Su denominación recuerda también el empleo que del grano de cereal se hacía
para sobrealimentar algunas aves destinadas a carne. (1999).
In the first example, the overfed animal is implicit, but is required for the Â�
construction
of the verbal schema.
ïœ´ïœ¸.â•… To pour in abundance.
ïœ´ïœ¹.â•… To overflow. To pour excessively.
ïœµïœ°.â•… In actors: An exaggerated interpretation.
ïœµïœ±.â•… To exaggerate one’s expression when dealing with someone.
ïœµïœ².â•… To give someone more food than they ordinarily need to be maintained.
ïœµïœ³.â•… To inject better or more fuel into an engine to increase performance above normal.
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ²ïœ¹
Sobrealzar.
1.â•… tr. Alzar demasiado algo o aumentar su elevación.54
	(38)	
e con labros gruessos duros & nudosos rebueltos & sobrealçados: cauernosos
auientes color blao & obscur (1493).
	(39)	 y el ron clarín, tempranamente bebido, sobrealzaba los ánimos. (1962).
As was the case with sobresalir and taking into account the spatial value of the verbs
that combine with sobre- (salir [exit] and alzar [lift]), it is not so much a case of ‘alzar
demasiado [lifting too high]’, but of ‘alzar por encima de los demás [lifting above
Â�
others]’. That is, we dare to think that a certain comparison is implicit in the two
cases. Obviously, the consequence of lifting an element above the others is that it is
Â�
understood as too high, in the sense that it enphasizes, exceeds or is ahead.
Sobreañadir.
1.â•… tr. Añadir con exceso o con repetición.55
	(40)	
antes estoy persuadido a que en el fondo tiene mucho de verdad, en la forma
que expliqué arriba; aunque a aquella verdad se hayan sobreañadido algunas
fábulas. (1736).
	(41)	
En el decorado se integra el atrezzo, que completa el verismo y puede Â�Â�
sobre-añadir significados. (1993).
We incorporate the verb in this subset due to the definition of the DRAE and the defini-
tion of María Moliner (‘Añadir más, otra vez, o demasiado’);56 however, in the examples
found, of which we illustrate only 2, we did not find exactly the value of ‘excess’, but
simply an iteration value understood as ‘añadir encima de [to add on]’; that is, ‘añadir
algo encima de otra cosa [add something on something else]’. Neverthless, it seems easy
to reach the meaning of ‘excess’ from our own examples with the indicated values:
	(42)	
La doctrina celestial por sí misma sola tiene todo el influxo que es menester
para conducirnos a la patria. Todo lo que se le sobreañade es superfluo;
(1730).
Sobredimensionar.
1.â•… tr. Dar a algo dimensiones excesivas.57 La empresa ha sobredimensionado la
plantilla laboral.
2.â•… tr. Dar a algo más importancia de la que en realidad tiene.58 No querían
sobredimensionar el problema.
ïœµïœ´.â•… To lift something too high or increase its elevation.
ïœµïœµ.â•… To add in excess or repeatedly.
ïœµïœ¶.â•… To add more, another time, or too much.
ïœµïœ·.â•… To give something excessive dimensions.
ïœµïœ¸.â•… To give something more importance than it actually has.

otorgue la verdadera medida de localización, sin sobredimensionar su
Â�importancia. (1984).
	(44)	
En la práctica, sin embargo, se acostumbra a sobredimensionar este volumen,

The verb also seems a recent creation: it is not attested in the CORDE, nor is it reflected
in Corominas & Pascual or Cuervo. María Moliner does include it (‘Presentar o
representar una cosa como más grande o más importante de lo que es en realidad.
Exagerar’).59 The idea of excess is in the two meanings of the DRAE, either applied
to something measurable (plantilla laboral [staff]) or to something not measurable
(el problema [the problem]), which means that excess should not be considered in its
physical dimension, but intellectual.
Sobreexcitar.
1.â•… tr. Aumentar o exagerar las propiedades vitales de todo el organismo o de
una de sus partes.60 U. t. c. prnl.
	(45)	

procu-raban sobreexcitar el entusiasmo de la división aragonesa (1868).
The verb is of recent formation, despite being attested in the CORDE. Corominas and
Pascual collected it, but without a date.
Sobreexplotar.
1.â•… tr. Utilizar en exceso cualquier tipo de recurso.61
	(47)	 lo cual significó bajar los precios y sobreexplotar a la mano de obra (1981)
The verb shows a clear meaning of ‘excess’ and appears only attested in the CREA.
María Moliner also reflected it in its dictionary: ‘Explotar de forma abusiva un recurso
natural’.62
Sobrexceder.
1.â•… tr. Exceder, sobrepujar, aventajar a alguien.63

	(49)	
no se mide o pesa para examinar si iguala o sobreexcede a la inverisimilitud

The excess value is doubly represented: in the value of the prefix and in the meaning of
the verb to which it is bound.
Sobreganar.
1.â•… tr. Ganar con ventaja o con exceso.64
	(50)	
Y desta manera se puede [y] avn [se] deue sobreganar amor reuerençial en
retribuçión del primer marco que reçebimos, el qual segund dixe es amor
syngular. (1455–1460).
All medieval examples are from Teresa of Cartagena, and there is no further data
in CORDE or CREA, except for an example from 1640. Corominas & Pascual and
Cuervo do not include it either.
Sobregirar.
1.â•… tr. Exceder en un giro del crédito disponible.65
	(51)	
Comprar y vender bienes muebles e inmuebles, gravarlos con prenda o
hipoteca, recibir en préstamo, sobregirar u obtener avances en cuenta
(1950–1967).
	(52)	
donde se sostiene que el Poder Judicial se habría sobregirado en sus gastos
(1989).
The verb is attested only fairly recently, and with a meaning linked to ‘excess’ clearly.
What is not so clear is that it is a transitive verb. María Moliner also describes it as
Â�
transitive: ‘En negocios, hacer un giro por valor superior al crédito disponible”,66
Â�
however, the examples found are both transitive and intransitive.
Sobrestimar.
1.â•… tr. Estimar algo por encima de su valor.67
	(53)	
pudieron habernos inducido a sobrestimar el tono general de aquella
velada.(1962).
	(54)	 pero por la tendencia a sobreestimar el valor personal (1946).
The verb appears to be of recent creation. It is not collected by Corominas & Pascual or
Cuervo. Interestingly, the DRAE does not include the double possibility sobrestimar/
sobreestimar. María Moliner does include it: ‘Estimar a alguien o algo por encima de lo
ïœ¶ïœ´.â•… To win with an advantage or excess.
ïœ¶ïœµ.â•… To exceed in a payment the available credit.
ïœ¶ïœ¶.â•… In business, to make a payment for a value greater than the available credit.
ïœ¶ïœ·.â•… Estimating something over its value.
ïœ³ïœ³ïœ²	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
que merece o vale realmente’.68 Quantification is really not made explicit by the prefix,
but the very verb estimar [to estimate, to appreciate]. Estimar implies a valuation to
some degree, and combined with the prefix it is established that this assessment is ‘por
encima [above]’ the degree that according to the subject should Â�
correspond it, which
leads, somehow, to the overall value of ‘excess’.
This is also the case of sobrevalorar [to overestimate], where the verb valorar
implies a valuation to some degree, and combined with sobre- indicates that degree:
excess brought about by an assessment ‘por encima de [above]’ what is established by
the subject.
Sobrevalorar.
1.â•… tr. Otorgar a alguien o algo mayor valor del que realmente tiene.69
	(55)	 Los reyes comienzan a sobrevalorar lo extranjero (1946–1953).
This verb does not appear in Corominas & Pascual or Cuervo. María Moliner includes
it: ‘Estimar a alguien o algo por encima de lo que merece o vale realmente’.70 Indeed,
we tend to think that it is a recent formation.
Sobrepujar.
1. tr. Dicho de una cosa o de una persona: Exceder a otra en cualquier línea.71
	(56)	 Ca la propiadat deue en la esecuçion sobrepujar. (1260).
	(57)	
por que abonda enellos calentura natural por ende quieren sobrepujar alos
otros en gloria & en honrra asy commo los elementos frio (1293).
As it is followed from the examples, the verb is attested very early and with plenty of
uses. Both Corominas & Pascual and Cuervo also collected it. It must be taken into
account that the excess value is not only in the prefix, but in the base verb with which
it combines:
Pujar2.
(Del lat. podĭum, poyo).
1.â•… tr. Dicho de un licitador: Aumentar el precio puesto a algo que se subasta.72
2.â•… tr. ant. Exceder o aventajar.73 Era u. t. c. intr.
3.â•… intr. ant. Subir, ascender.74
ïœ¶ïœ¸.â•… To appreciate someone or something above what it really deserves or is worth.
ïœ¶ïœ¹.â•… To give someone or something a higher value than it actually has.
ïœ·ïœ°.â•… To appreciate someone or something more than they are worth or deserve.
ïœ·ïœ±.â•… In people or things: to exceed another in any way.
ïœ·ïœ².â•… For a bidder: to increase the price on something at auction.
ïœ·ïœ³.â•… To exceed or outstrip.

	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ³ïœ³
Sobrecargar.
1.â•… tr. Cargar con exceso.75
2.â•… tr. Coser por segunda vez una costura redoblando un borde sobre el otro para
que quede bien rematada.76
	(58)	
le diere de quanto puso con el duenno osi la sobrecargare, sil muriere o si se
dannare (1193).
	(59)	
No me congojes ni me importunes, que sobrecargar el cuidado es aguijar al
animal (1499–1502).
The meaning of ‘excess’ is clear in all the examples found. The second example
Â�
indicated by the DRAE, also present in María Moliner, seems insignificant in com-
parison with the examples in the first case. However, let us consider that this specific
meaning is an example of the more general action ‘acción hecha con exceso [action
carried out Â�
excessively]’, therefore motivated by meaning 1.
We looked at the verb sobrepasar [to exceed] with its spatial meanings:
	(60)	
este gran fauor que al hombre Dios a dado exede y sobrepasa todo amor.
(1575).
	(61)	 No sobrepasar esa normativa (1607).
We must discuss, however, that the verb can also have a meaning linked to ‘excess’,
perhaps more clear in the reflexive examples:
	(62)	
porque Dávilas y Ocampos trataron siempre de sobrepasarse por todos los
medios de valer que tiene consagrados la civilización. (1845–1874).
In any case, we must bear in mind that the base verb (pasar [to pass]) has a Â�comparative
sense similar to gradation, and the prefix reinforces the idea that ‘se pasa a alguien o
algo, por encima [someone or something is overtaken from above]’, hence the Â�meaning
of ‘superar, aventajar [to overcome, to overwrite]’, because if ‘pasamos por encima,
ganamos [we overtake, we win]’.
With all the peculiarities identified in verbs with the meaning of ‘excess’, it seems
clear not only that it is the most common meaning in Spanish, but that it is also very
productive today. It is indeed so productive that the Nueva Gramática de la Lengua
Española language of the RAE includes sobrecalentar [to overheat] (2009:â•›710–711) as
one of the cases of sobre- with the meaning of excess, a verb that is not found in the
dictionary of the RAE, although it is in María Moliner:
Sobrecalentar:
Tr. y prnl. Calentar[se] en exceso, particularmente un aparato o máquina.77
ïœ·ïœµ.â•… To overload.
ïœ·ïœ¶.â•… To sew a seam for the second time folding an edge over the other so that it is well Â�finished.
ïœ·ïœ·.â•… To heat excessively, particularly a device or machine.
ïœ³ïœ³ïœ´	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
The CORDE and CREA also collect some recent examples of sobrecalentar, in
which the value of ‘excess’ is clear and obvious:
	(63)	
lo más práctico es la aplicación del vapor sobrecalentado, lo cual puede
Â�
hacerse por medio de la (1896).
	(64)	
advirtió que una reducción demasiado rápida puede sobrecalentar la
economía y amenazar la política (1988).

We think that the meaning of intensification – understood as ‘excess’ – is not exactly
motivated, as the RAE states (2009:â•›711), because it is interpreted from the notion of
‘limit’:78 overcoming or going over a limit usually implies some negative Â�
connotations,
ïœ·ïœ¸.â•… In clear harmony with what is already commented by Neira (19xx: 245)
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ³ïœµ
according to the RAE, but, as laid down in the Grammar, this does not happen in
examples such as sobrevivir [survive]. Similarly, and also collected by the RAE (2009),
going over a certain limit does not necessarily imply the notion of excess: sobrehumano
[superhuman]. Contrary to what is said in the RAE (2009), we consider that the
Â�
meaning of ‘excess’ is motivated by a simple orientational metaphor: more is up. Lakoff
and Johnson (1986:â•›50) understand orientational metaphors to be those in which it is
no longer a concept which is structured in terms of another, but it is an entire global
system of concepts that is organized in relation to another. They are labeled orientational
because most of these metaphors have to do with spatial orientation: up-down, inside-
outside, in front-behind, deep-superficial, central-peripheral. These orientations arise
from the fact that we have bodies of a particular kind that work the way they do within
our physical environment. I.e. they are not random, they are based on our physical and
cultural experience. Although polar oppositions like up-down, inside-outside, etc., are
of a physical nature, orientational metaphors based on them may vary from one culture
to another. For example, in some cultures the future is ahead of us, while in others it is
behind. Or, as we have seen in sobrebeber [to drink too much], above is later.
The experiential basis of the metaphor more is above, specified in the value of
‘excess’ for sobre-, is very simple: it comes from our experience of stacking objects and
seeing the increase in height, direction being what enables us to perceive, for example,
growth; that is, what is above is increasing and making the object (figure) larger. It
depends on the subject whether the evaluation is considered an excess or not, and the
verbs that we have mentioned do outline that excess value.
According to Johnson (1987:â•›122–123), this metaphor is based on the schema of
‘scale’, essential for quantitative and qualitative aspects of our experience:
i.	 Scales have a more or less fixed directionality: the higher the upward motion, the
greater the amount or intensity.
ii.	 Scales are cumulative: if you have n+1 on a scale you also have n.
iii.	 Scales have an associated normative value: to have more or less of something can
be good or bad, desirable or undesirable.
iv.	 Scales can be open or closed: they can continue indefinitely in a given direction
or end at a specific point, and that point establishes the upper limit of an amount,
intensity, or degree.
The idea of ‘excess’ becomes apparent in the verb sobrar [to have too much, to be left
over], from superāre, where the form super is transparent, just like in the medieval
adjectives sobejo, used also as an adverb, and sobejano ‘excessive, too much’.
4.3â•… Uses with an iterative value
We noted earlier that iteration involves aspectual modification of the verb, and the
meaning that is added is of successive repetition with verbs that denote telic or
ïœ³ïœ³ïœ¶	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
Â�
perfective actions. Repetition of the action has an impact on the outcome of the action
expressed in the simple verb, so the result obtained with the prefixed verb modifies the
previous meaning.
We find only three intransitive verbs with this value: sobrebeber [to drink too
much or again], sobrecenar [to eat again] and sobrevenir [to occur suddenly].
As we noted in the previous section to refer to sobrebeber, cognitively there is a
link between ‘to drink on top of what has already been drunk’ and its logical outcome:
‘to drink too much’. The iteration value is also indicated by María Moliner: ‘Beber otra
vez. Beber en exceso [To drink again. Drinking excessively]’.
Sobrecenar.
1.â•… intr. Cenar por segunda vez.79 U. t. c. tr.
	(65)	 Dice “sobrecenar” por “merendar”. Y “caducar” por “morir”.(2000).
The verb is also included in María Moliner’s dictionary with that same meaning: ‘to
have dinner for the second time’. Repetition of the action is easily relatable to the spa-
tial value: ‘cenar encima de lo ya cenado [dining on top of what has already been
dined]’. However, the first examples found are not verbal, but from the noun sobrecena,
meaning it is not a verb formed by prefixation, but it is a verbal derivative on a nominal
base (sobrecena) formed by a prefix and a noun. Therefore, the argument conflation
which it would entail would be hacer sobrecena [to do sobrecena]. In any case, we
must remove this example from the subset that we are looking at, since it is not a case
of verbal formation through prefixation.
Sobrevenir.
(Del lat. supervenīre).
1.â•… intr. Dicho de una cosa: Acaecer o suceder además o después de otra.80
2.â•… intr. Venir improvisadamente.81
3.â•… intr. Venir a la sazón.82

	(68)	

ïœ·ïœ¹.â•… To have dinner for the second time.
ïœ¸ïœ°.â•… To take place or happen in addition to or after something else.
ïœ¸ïœ±.â•… To come unexpectedly.
ïœ¸ïœ².â•… To come at that time.
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ³ïœ·
As you can see, the verb is attested from very early. It is also collected by Corominas &
Pascual and Cuervo. However, early meanings seem more linked to meaning 1, where
someone or something comes ‘after’ someone or something else. The idea of ‘posteri-
ority’ is also easily motivated by the experiential physical base sobre-, because what is
sobre [on top] or encima [above] has to be placed after what is underneath: lo que está
encima es posterior [above is later]. María Moliner collects only meaning 2:
‘Suceder un accidente o cualquier cosa repentina o imprevista: ‘sobrevino una
epidemia [una desgracia familiar, la guerra]’. Caer, echarse encima, saltear,
venirse encima’.83
This verb already existed in Latin. And while the Cuervo’s dictionary gives for
superueniō the meaning of ‘llegar de improvisto, venir sobre [to arrive suddenly, to
come upon]’, which is the meaning that seems to be expressed in María Moliner’s, in
Latin it seems somewhat residual.84
This value of the verb, linked to the idea of ‘sudden action’, was already seen in the
previous section in cases such as sobresalir or sobresaltar. The explanation is obviously the
same, taking into account Latin meaning 2, according to the OLD: if any event or circum-
stance comes sobre [upon] someone, they do not expect it, and therefore it can only occur
‘If they do not see it, if they do not have time to be able to reject’, i.e. abruptly. This same
meaning is given in Spanish, but meaning 1 is not found in Latin, only in Spanish.
All transitive verbs supported the same meaning: the repetition of the action of
the base verb.
Sobrearar.
1.â•… tr. Repetir en una tierra la labor del arado.85
	(69)	
Y con esto veréis que habemos hecho lo que es de buen labrador, favorecido

ïœ¸ïœ³.â•… Occurence of an accident or any sudden or unexpected thing: ‘an epidemic [a family

ïœ³ïœ³ïœ¸	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
There are few examples of the verb, but its meaning of repetition is clear.
Sobreasar.
1.â•… tr. Volver a poner a la lumbre lo que está asado o cocido, para que se tueste.86
Setting aside the criticism of this verb by Casares, indeed there are few examples.
María Moliner does not collect it either. But if we go along with what was said by the
DRAE, the meaning can coincide with the group that we are dealing with (or, where
appropriate, with the value of ‘lightly’ from the spatial meaning).
	(70)	 Se sobreasan los higadillos de los pollos, (1891–1894).
Sobreedificar.
1.â•… tr. Construir sobre otra edificación u otra fábrica.87
2.â•… tr. Construir un volumen de edificaciones mayor de lo autorizado.88
	(71)	
Y ahora, hermanos, os encomiendo á Dios, y á la palabra de su gracia: el cual es

preceptivo permiso municipal. A finales de este mes cumple el plazo para que

Meaning 2 may be the result of 1, and is certainly linked to the previous meaning of
‘excess’, if we recall the orientational metaphor of more is up.
Sobreimprimir.
1.â•… tr. Impr. Imprimir algo sobre un texto o sobre una imagen gráfica.89
We discussed this verb in the spatial values section. However, the verb really conveys
repetition, since it obviously has a spatial value as it is printed on top of something, but
according to the DRAE and María Moliner (‘Imprimir algo sobre un texto o imagen’),
it is printed on something that has already been printed. However, if what is printed
is not the same, we could understand that it does not fit exactly under the meaning of
repetition, but rather the spatial meaning.
Sobrepintarse.
1.â•… prnl. Repintarse la cara.90
	(73)	 ante su propia descolorida o más bien sobrepintada tarjeta postal (1993).
The example does not allow us to properly check whether the meaning is exactly
Â�
‘repetition of action’, or ‘excess’, this last value also being found in repintar [to repaint],
ïœ¸ïœ¶.â•… To return to the heat something which is roasted or cooked, so as to toast it.
ïœ¸ïœ·.â•… To build upon another building or another factory.
ïœ¸ïœ¸.â•… To build a greater volume of buildings than authorized.
ïœ¸ïœ¹.â•… To print something on a text or a graphic image.
ïœ¹ïœ°.â•… To repaint one’s face.
	 From Latin super- to Spanish sobre-	 ïœ³ïœ³ïœ¹
but it seems to be motivated by the idea of repeating the action. María Moliner also
collects this meaning: ‘Arreglarse con pinturas y afeites. Repintarse’.91
Sobresembrar.
1.â•… tr. Sembrar sobre lo ya sembrado.92
	(74)	 
Que si el demonio procura apedrear los trigos cuando están en berza y sobre-
sembrar cizania cuando enpiezan a nacer, (1607).
The meaning is clearly ‘excess’, but we can find an example in which we can Â�
consider
the possibility of a spatial value allowing a cognitive link between sow over > repetition
action > excess:
	 (75)	
en la sementera del Euangelio apartan la mala semilla ques el enemigo
sobresembró en las buenas plantas. (1624).
Sobresolar2.
(De sobre1 y solar3).
1.â•… tr. Echar un segundo suelo sobre lo solado.93
The examples we have found correspond to sobresolar1 (Section 4.1), and not to this verb,
which, as opposed to 1, is built on solar in the sense of ‘echar suelas al calzado [to put
soles on a shoe]’. Here the solar verb enabling it has the meaning of ‘revestir el suelo con
ladrillos, losas u otro material [to cover the floor with bricks, tiles and other Â�
materials]’,
which, according to Corominas & Pascual, was already documented in Nebrija.
Sobrevestir.
(Del lat. supervestīre).
1.â•… tr. Poner un vestido sobre el que se lleva.94 U. t. c. prnl.
	(76)	
dijo san Pablo que no se querían desnudar sino sobrevestirse. Y quien se ha

	(77)	 sino a adquirir hábitos de virtudes y sobrevestirse de dones espirituales,(1684).
	(78)	 o cubierto con un sobrevestido de lino, (1750).
Corominas & Pascual also attest this meaning: ‘dress upon dress.
We should also mention another two verbs already mentioned in the preceding
section on the intensifying value of ‘excess’.
Sobrecargar.
1.â•… tr. Cargar con exceso.
2.â•… tr. Coser por segunda vez una costura redoblando un borde sobre el otro para
que quede bien rematada.
ïœ¹ïœ±.â•… To doll up with paints and makeup. To repaint.
ïœ¹ïœ².â•… To sow what has already been sown.
ïœ¹ïœ³.â•… To put a second floor on the flooring.
ïœ¹ïœ´.â•… To wear a dress over the one already worn.
ïœ³ïœ´ïœ°	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
Sobreañadir.
1.â•… tr. Añadir con exceso o con repetición.95
The interesting thing about this meaning is the aspectual value of repetition of
the action: the repetition of the action has an impact on the outcome of the action
expressed in the simple verb, so the result obtained with the prefixed verb modifies
the previous meaning. The cognitively motivatable value of ‘excess’, according to the
perspective of the subject and present in many cases, results from the idea of repeating
the action. Hence it often being difficult to determine if we are looking at the meaning
of ‘action repetition’ or the meaning of ‘excess’.

The idea of repetition, as we said earlier, is motivated by the spatial value and is
hard to separate sometimes, since if ‘you do something on top of something else’, if
they are similar things, they are repeated, obviously. Similarly, the metaphor what is
above is later, based on a cause-consequence metonymy, is also present in many of the
meanings of this set.
4.4â•… 
Uses with a ‘lightly’ value
There are only three verbs that we can include in this section. However, the Â�
significant
relationship they imply is very interesting. Sobresanar is attested from very early
on, but currently does not appear in the CREA. However, we can find it in María
Moliner’s dictionary: ‘Cicatrizarse una herida o llaga sólo superficialmente. Disimular
Â�
cambiando su aspecto un defecto o una acción’.96
Sobrecurar is attested by Corominas & Pascual, and was also reflected in María
Moliner’s dictionary (‘Curar a la ligera. Cicatrizar una herida sólo superficialmente’),97
but we did not find examples in the corpora used.
The last verb included is sobrebarrer, of which there is only one example in
the CREA, and not very clear with this value.98 It is not listed by Corominas &
Pascual. However, it does appear in María Moliner’s dictionary (‘Barrer algo a la
ligera’).99
In spite of the lack of examples for two of the cases, we will go with the Â�
definitions
of the DRAE (matching those in María Moliner’s). We will start with sobresanar,
attested from very early on and with a fully spatial constructional meaning, as was the
case with other spatial intransitive verbs, such as sobrenadar. It would be a verb with
argument conflation of path. However, we must consider that nadar [to swim] is a
motion verb [manner of motion] while sanar [to heal] is not, which is why the action
of sanar por encima [to heal superficially] can be spatially understood, as proven in
some examples from the CORDE, but it is also easy to consider the action metaphor-
ically: si algo está o actúa encima, está o actúa fuera, no está o actúa dentro 100 [if
ïœ¹ïœ¶.â•… To heal a wound or sore only superficially. To disguise by changing its appearance a
defect or an action.
ïœ¹ïœ·.â•… To heal lightly. To heal a wound only superficially.
ïœ¹ïœ¸.â•… Cada día se nos informa de un nuevo y eficaz invento o descubrimiento, y según los Â�estudiosos
de bata blanca están al caer conquistas científicas que sobrebarrerán para siempre lacras que la
Humanidad ha arrastrado desde la prehistoria (1983).
ïœ¹ïœ¹.â•… To sweep something lightly.
ïœ±ïœ°ïœ°.â•… With ‘arriba [up]’ and ‘abajo [down]’ we perceive a full vertical axis, restricted to the
limits that ‘arriba’ and ‘abajo’, as endpoints of a certain perception of the vertical axis, impose
ïœ³ïœ´ïœ²	 José Luis Cifuentes Honrubia & Javier Fresnillo Núñez
Â�
something is or acts on top, it is or acts outside, is not or does not act inside]. Since the
action of sanar is only superficial, it is possible to explain the meaning of ‘disimular un
defecto con una cosa superficial [to disguise a defect with a superficial thing]’, because
we Â�
metaphorically apply the schema to other actions, in which ‘on the outside’, i.e.
‘superficially’, it is Â�apparently correct, but ‘on the inside’ there are, if not injuries, at least
serious problems: appearance is outside, the essence is inside.
Thus, the meaning of sobresanar, rather than ‘lightness’, is a spatial value, under-
stood as something superficial, physical. From the moment in which it is possible to
apply physical superficial action to other domains where the superficiality does not
only have to be physical, we have created the meaning of ‘lightness’. This meaning is
already found in sobrecurar, a verb which surely appeared later, although we do not
have conclusive data on the matter.101 In the case of sobrecurar, superficiality is not
only physically understood (‘curar a medias [to half-cure])’, because it is cured ‘por
encima [over]’, but not ‘por dentro [inside]’, but also metaphorically (‘curar descui-
dadamente [to cure carelessly]’): Johnson (1987) collects the image schema of center/
periphery, whereby we can interpret that what is central is important, what is periph-
eral is not important’. With the verb sobrebarrer we find the meaning of sobre- exclu-
sively linked to the peripheral value. The absence of evidence, including Corominas &
Pascual, suggests that it came later than the previous verbs.
Sobrebarrer.
1.â•… tr. Barrer ligeramente.102
to location; however, ‘encima [over]’ and ‘debajo [below]’ do not limit as ends the vertical
axis of the object. With “arriba” the vertical axis of the object is spatialized, with ‘encima’ it
is Â�
spatialized outside of the object. It is the functional perception that we make of the object
that matters for the determination of ‘arriba’, i.e. our way of structuring the object in two parts,
‘arriba’ and‘abajo’. On the contrary,‘encima’ occurs outside of the object. In‘arriba’ the ground
is the articulation that we make of the object as ‘arriba’ and ‘abajo’, and we must consider that
the ground is also known. The ‘encima’ ground is the localizing object. If we say something
is encima del edificio [on top of the building], it is out of the building, flying above it, for
example, but it is outside the boundaries of the building. This characterization seems to select
the‘arriba’localizing object (ground) as a magnitude,if not of large object itself,at least clearly
structurable in parts or subparts, which differentiates it from ‘encima’, which does not need
this. Thus, with‘arriba’ we locate the top of the vertical axis of a localizing object, with‘encima’
we see the location of an object according to a vertical relation (Cifuentes, 1996:â•›102).
ïœ±ïœ°ïœ±.â•… However, it must have been much less common than sobresanar, due to the number of
examples found in the CORDE, and on the other hand, we must bear in mind that, according
to Corominas and Pascual, curar, which is the base to form sobrecurar, is normal as of the 14th
century, but it has other previous phonetic variants. That is, curar and sobresanar, were at least
temporarily matched, and it seems easy to think that sobrecurar was generated later.

Although at some point it may have seemed not to be so, our study was not intended to
be historical, though sometimes we use the help of the history of language. We would
simply like to record the cognitive relationship between various meanings motivated
by the prefix sobre- in verbal combinations.
The difference from Latin in the distribution of meanings is palpable, showing,
that while spatial meaning is the experiential basis for other meanings, non-spatial
meanings are the most abundant in Spanish, although they are accessible through
spatial meanings: fictive motion, temporary location, excess, repetition, sudden
action, incomplete action, broader action, overwriting, location of non-physical
elements.

Word formation processes and proposals
for the classification of formal neologisms*
María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
University of Cádiz
This chapter approaches one of the most controversial topics concerning word
formation and lexical creation: classification processes for lexical units according
to the creation resources they are based on. The paper analyzes the lists of word
formation mechanisms given by different authors and surveys the typologies
proposed for the classification of new lexical units. On the one hand, it claims the
lack of unanimity regarding word formation processes; and, on the other hand,
it argues that the classification of newly created lexical units does not fit in any of
the lists of word formation mechanisms that already existed; by contrast, there is a
tendency to elaborate new proposals. The lack of agreement complicates the task of
classifying words following the criteria of the creation method they are based on.

1.â•… Introduction
The study we are presenting consists, basically, of two parts. In the first part (see
Â�
Section  2.), we will go over various opinions regarding word formation and the
Â�
processes involved. To this end, we will work on representative investigations on
the subject. Our aim is to determine to what extent the conceptions of the Â�
different
authors we are going to look at differ; whether the classifications Â�
proposed are
Â�
completely irreconcilable or complementary, and where exactly the differences
*â•… This paper belongs to a series of projects from the consolidated inter-university group
of the Andalucian Investigation Plan known as Semaínein (Code HUM 147), financed by
the Junta de Andalucía and pertaining to the area of General Linguistics in the Department
of Philology of the University of Cádiz. Within this framework, the paper presented is part
of a line of investigation developed to cover lexical formation and creation. Other previous
approaches on behalf of members of the group following this line of study are those by Díaz
Hormigo (2003; 2004; 2007; 2008; 2009; 2010); Díaz Hormigo and Varo Varo (in press) and
Varo Varo, Díaz Hormigo and Paredes Duarte (2009); and, focusing exclusively on the field of
word formation, the works of Díaz Hormigo (2000; 2001).

found in the Â�
various typologies presented lie. In the second part of our study
(see Section 3.), we will proceed to compare the general conclusions obtained from
our revision with the proposals of classification for formal neologisms. The name
formal neologisms is given to new lexical units that present either new Â�
signifiers for
pre-existing signifies or both new signifiers and new signifies. Lastly (see Â�Section 4.),
we will go on to present a series of conclusions and proposals.
2.â•… Word formation processes
To introduce the matter that now concerns us in the field of word formation we will
mention two quotes from two very distinguished morphologists in the world of
Â�
Spanish linguistics. These quotes have been selected at random among many others
that contribute to expressing the same idea:
Las denominaciones y definiciones de los procesos de formación de palabras
son muy variadas según los distintos métodos lingüísticos y, aun en el seno de
cada uno de éstos, según los investigadores. Resulta difícil encontrar un acuerdo
general, una opinión ampliamente compartida. (Lázaro Mora 1986:â•›221)
Apesardequecontamosconobrasdecalidadeneláreadelamorfologíasincrónica
del español, es preciso reconocer que faltan aún estudios descriptivos sobre un
número importante de formaciones complejas – y lo que es más importante –
no se ha alcanzado un cierto consenso mayoritario sobre cuestiones básicas que
atañen a problemas de definición y delimitación de los tipos morfológicos. 
 (Varela Ortega 1993:â•›14)
Indeed,thecomparativeandcontrastiveanalysisofdifferenttreatisesandÂ�monographic
studies regarding so-called word formation reveal, at least,
1.	 a conception, from various authors, on the location, definition and object of study
of this linguistic discipline, to which the word formation processes these authors
list do not adapt;
2.	 incoherence, also, in the considerations given by one same author, between the
definitions of some word formation processes and the classification and articula-
tion of the procedures those mechanisms include;
3.	 confusion between phenomena and forms. So, occasionally the classification of
the phenomena is based on the list of forms that participate in obtaining complex
words, which are supposed to adjust to that phenomenon;
4.	 a significant diversity in proposals of general typologies of word formation
processes;
5.	 disagreements when describing some mechanisms as word formation processes;
	 Word formation processes and proposals for the classification of formal neologisms	 ïœ³ïœ´ïœ¹
6.	 relevant differences in the characterization of the productive mechanisms
mentioned;
7.	 divergence in the detailed configuration of each of the processes;
8.	 differences in the treatment of the main problems affecting each of these
Â�mechanisms, and
9.	 an excessive terminological proliferation in the denomination of processes and
concepts. Furthermore, often the same term is used to refer to different processes.
For the basis and explanations of these matters we refer to the conclusions
obtained in the manuals by Almela Pérez (1999), Alvar Ezquerra (1993), Lang (1990)
and Varela Ortega (2005).1
2.1â•… Definitions of word formation
And so, regarding the first aspect mentioned, we would like to add that not all
the authors of these monographies explicitly state what they understand by word
Â�formation. Nor do they describe what they consider to be the object of study of this
discipline. However, bringing together the characterizations and definitions laid out
by the various authors (see Almela Pérez 1999:â•›19, 31; Alvar Ezquerra 1993:â•›20; Lang
1990:â•›11; Varela Ortega 2005:â•›8), we can state that all of those consulted consider that
word formation implies broadening the lexical scope of the language using processes
that are mainly morphological.
For this reason, it appears irrelevant to include, in word formation processes,
other mechanisms that do not present this morphemic character. After all, we
Â�
cannot include as morphological processes the word formation resources listed by
Almela Pérez under the groups of modification and combination (see Section  1.
of the APPENDIX §): conversion, substitution, replacement, repetition, initialism,
Â�
acronym, and the subgroup of abbreviation. Nor can we class as morphological the
mechanisms mentioned by Lang (see Section 3. of the APPENDIX §), such as what he
calls acronym -defined by Lang (1990:â•›36) as the creation of words using the first letter
or syllable of names of companies or institutions –, clipping or elision of end syllables
or initials, and blending, or joining of separate words regardless of their morphe-
mic structure (see Lang 1990:â•›
36). Other mechanisms that are not morphemic are
ïœ±.â•… In the APPENDIX § you will find a schematic version of the classifications of word
Â�
formation processes provided by each of these authors. You may also find examples and
Â�
definitions of less well-known or more specific mechanisms. Furthermore, in Section 5. of
the appendix § we have included the classification of formal neologisms to which we will be
Â�
referring in the second part of our study.
ïœ³ïœµïœ°	 María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
shortening, initialism and acronym or ‘lexical crossing’ of fragments of words, whole
words or themes, Â�
mentioned by Varela Ortega (see Section 4. of the APPENDIX §).
However, an exception of what has been said is Alvar Ezquerra’s approach (1993).
This author mentions (see Section  2. of the APPENDIX §): acronyms, or joining
the opposite ends of two words (see Alvar Ezquerra 1993:â•›
45); the graphic process
of Â�
compound abbreviation, and complex abbreviation or initialism as modalities of
shortening, which can be included among the mechanisms of composition because, in
each case, two or more words are involved.
2.2â•… Definitions of word formation processes
Further disagreements in the considerations of one same author can be observed
in the definitions of some word formation processes and the classification and
Â�
articulation of the methods those processes include. Let us use as an example of this
discordance the unanimous characterization of composition as ‘joining or combin-
ing one or more lexemes or lexical units that can appear free and independent within
the language’ (see Almela Pérez 1999:â•›145; Alvar Ezquerra 1993:â•›20; Lang 1990:â•›22;
Varela Ortega 2005:â•›73). But we find that the so-called vulgar prefixes, which coincide
with prepositions (Alvar Ezquerra 1993:â•›39), are elements of composition according
to Alvar Ezquerra (1993:â•›
21, 39–43). The reason is that prepositions can serve as
prefixes and also appear independently. But Alvar Ezquerra does not bear in mind
that prepositions are not lexical units. Nor does he advise that, as he himself seems
to implicitly admit judging by the examples, not all vulgar prefixes coincide with
prepositions. And these prefixes that do not coincide with prepositions do not have
an independent or separable existence.
There are also certain comments made by Almela Pérez (1999:â•›
57–59), Lang
(1990:â•›
221) and Varela Ortega (2005:â•›
58–59) that are incoherent with the definition
of composition formulated. These authors mention that the types of prefixing using
adverbs and prepositions could also be considered examples of composition, Â�according
to studies carried out by some linguists. But finally, Almela Pérez (1999:â•›
59), Lang
(1990:â•›221) and Varela Ortega (2005:â•›59) choose to include them under derivation.
Similarly, special mention should be made of the doubts expressed regarding the
inclusion of word formation with classic subjects and classic elements of Greek or
Latin origin as a mechanism either of prefixing and suffixing or of composition. Alvar
Ezquerra (1993:â•›21, 38, 49–50) and Lang (1990:â•›97, 221) conclude that word formation
with classic elements should be included in prefixing or in suffixing. The reason is
that classic elements in word formation act almost like other affixes and, furthermore,
they do not have an independent existence within the language. But Almela Pérez
(1999:â•›59, 62, 104, 133, 154–160) and Varela Ortega (2005:â•›18–19, 59–60, 73–74) hold
that classic elements differ from affixes in various aspects. Therefore, combinations in
	 Word formation processes and proposals for the classification of formal neologisms	 ïœ³ïœµïœ±
which Â�
classic elements appear with a patrimonial lexeme, with another classic theme
or another classic element are compound formations. So, for these authors, classic
themes and classic elements are elements of composition.
2.3â•… Phenomena and forms
The disagreements in the location and characterization of, particularly, the mechanism
of prefixing can be due to confusion between the phenomena and forms involved in
obtaining complex words that adjust to this phenomenon. The authors consulted men-
tion the disparity of forms grouped under the name prefix. These forms that can act as
prefixes are Spanish prepositions, Greek and Latin prepositions that have not passed
on to Spanish as free morphemes or separable prepositions, adverbs, adjectives, quan-
tifiers and even classic lexemes and shortened words that may coincide with Latin or
Greek themes (see Almela Pérez 1992:â•›62 and Varela Ortega 2005:â•›58). Grouping such
a variety of forms under the name prefix implies strong discrepancies when inserting
the global phenomenon of prefixing in the field of word formation. This leads to the
location of the mechanism of prefixing being extremely unstable and to confusing
characterization. Therefore, prefixing can be considered the most difficult word for-
mation mechanism to define.
2.4â•… Typologies of word formation processes
In any case, even more representative is the disparity in the proposals of these
authors regarding the terms and classification of word formation processes. There is
also Â�
disparity in the articulation of these processes. In this sense, the Â�
classification
of Â�
general word formation processes made by Almela Pérez (1999) is most relevant.
This classification (see Section 1. of the APPENDIX §) consists of four main types:
addition, modification, subtraction or combination. We may observe an increase
in the word base thanks to a given element – addition –, an alteration in the word
base – Â�
modification –, the loss of an element – subtraction – or reduction and
Â�addition at the same time – combination –. Each of these types has its Â�corresponding
Â�
subtypes – 13 in total –. Prefixing, suffixing, intrafixing (which includes infixing and
interfixing), composition and parasynthesis are considered subtypes of Â�
addition.
Therefore, this author does not explicitly mention derivation as a word forma-
tion process. In turn, Lang (1990) and Varela Ortega (2005) hold (see Sections 3.
and 4. of the Â�
APPENDIX §) that there are, basically, two types of word formation
processes: derivation and composition.2 Alvar Ezquerra (1993) lists (see Section 2.
ïœ².â•… Which appear, in their corresponding classifications, along with the non morphological
word formation processes we mentioned earlier (see Section 2.1. of this study).
ïœ³ïœµïœ²	 María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
of the APPENDIX §) three processes he considers morphological resources that lead
to an increase in a Â�
language’s vocabulary: derivation, composition and parasynthe-
sis, although he warns that the latter is not a special word formation mechanism,
since it makes use of the other two methods.
2.5â•… The description of word formation processes
Furthermore, a contrastive analysis of different monographies on word Â�
formation,
such as the one carried out, allows us to perceive relevant differences in the
Â�
characterization of some of the mechanisms included. A valid example is the
Â�
treatment of parasynthesis. Almela Pérez (1999:â•›
29, 187–196) and Alvar Ezquerra
(1993:â•›20, 64) consider parasynthesis to be a word formation process with its own
consolidated Â�
profile. Varela Ortega (2005:â•›9, 32, 34) conceives it as one of the means
in which the process of derivation is articulated, along with prefixing, suffixing,
infixing and interfixing. And Lang (1990:â•›241–244) includes it among the so-called
‘miscellaneous word formation Â�
processes’ (see Lang 1990:â•›
241–262), along with
generic derivation, derivation of names of inhabitants of places, acronyms, blending
and clipping. These processes can be distinguished because parasynthesis, generic
derivation and the derivation of names of inhabitants of places have some aspects
in common with suffixing, whilst acronyms, blending and clipping differ from com-
position and derivation. This lack of consensus regarding the status of parasynthesis
cannot be justified due to the disparity in the definitions of this mechanism. All
the authors consulted describe it as the simultaneous combination of prefixing and
suffixing upon a single lexical base. For this reason, it is also labelled Â�
circunfixing
by Almela Pérez (1999:â•›
29, 187 Note  1) and Varela Ortega (2005:â•›
32). Alvar
Ezquerra also points out the traditional definition according to which parasynthetic
formations are the result of composition andÂ�suffixing at once.
2.6â•… Configuration of the formation processes
Furthermore, we can observe differences in the detailed configuration of each of
the formation processes. And our attention is also drawn to the differences in the
treatment of the main problems that affect each of the means the processes include.
As proof of this, we are going to refer to the means of interfixing and infixing; to the
resource commonly known as subtraction or regression, and to the variations in the
articulation of the basic structures that formations created through composition can
present.
2.6.1â•… Interfixing and infixing
Indeed, in spite of admitting that interfixes and infixes present a controversial Â�
status,
the resources of interfixing and infixing are mentioned by Almela Pérez (1999:â•›
29,
	 Word formation processes and proposals for the classification of formal neologisms	 ïœ³ïœµïœ³
161–186) and Varela Ortega (2005:â•›32, 35–36). But Varela Ortega considers them to
be means or mechanisms of derivation while Almela Pérez (1999:â•›
29, 186) groups
them under the names interfixing or intrafixing, which is a subtype of addition. Alvar
Ezquerra (1993:â•›21, 62–63) mentions only interfixes and Lang (1990:â•›26–28, 218–219)
refers only to infixes. Both of these authors classify infixes and interfixes within deriva-
tion processes.
2.6.2â•… Substraction or regression
The process commonly known as subtraction or regression deserves Â�
special mention.
Under these or other names (see Note 10 of this study) we refer to a process that is
often confused, on behalf of the authors themselves, with the mechanism of con-
version. Indeed, Lang (1990:â•›
35–36 193–196) understands that the Â�
morphological
process of regressive derivation -therefore, a derivation Â�process –, which he also labels
back formation must be interpreted as zero suffixing or none suffixing. Therefore, this
mechanism seems to be identified with the mechanism of conversion. However, Lang
specifies that this back formation belongs to the field of deverbal nominalization
(e.g.: deterioro [deterioration], alterne [socialization] and toma [take] taken from
deteriorar [to deteriorate], alternar [to socialize] and tomar [to take], respectively).3
Almela Pérez (1999:â•›
29–30, 196–198, 199–202), in turn, intends to differentiate
between conversion and regression. He states (see Almela Pérez 1999:â•›29–30, 196–198)
that conversion occurs when a lexeme from a given category acquires Â�
characteristics
of another category without the participation of a derivative Â�suffix, although what may
intervene are the inflections of the category adopted. He Â�
mentions, for example, the
transcategorization, in a none finite manner, of a verb into a noun: compra Â�[shopping],
plancha [ironing]. This implies, according to him, that the thematic vowel of verbs is
an inflectional morpheme. And according to Almela Pérez (1999:â•›29–30, 199–202)
regression occurs when the morphological reduction of a base takes place, which
generally implies a change of category. He again uses as an example the Â�substitution of
infinitive verb endings of Spanish verbs for other endings that, just as we interpreted
from the start, must not correspond with thematic vowels because, if they did, it
would be a case of conversion. However, judging by some of the examples mentioned
(demanda [claim], poda [pruning], duda [doubt]), it seems that the thematic vowel
can act as a suffix. Therefore, we cannot quite understand why they are not cases of
conversion. Another possibility is that the above-mentioned transcategorization, in a
non-finite manner, of a verb into a noun should be Â�
considered by Almela regression
and not conversion.
ïœ³.â•… Nevertheless, precisely in these deverbal nominalizations there is no case of zero or none
suffixing.
ïœ³ïœµïœ´	 María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
In any case, Varela Ortega (2005:â•›31) considers nearly all of these cases as examples
of postverbal derivation formations. She believes that subtraction or regression, which
is a mechanism or means for non-affix derivations, occurs only when the derived
word is obtained through the suppression of morphemes of the word base (e.g.: retén
[reserves], sostén [support] or desliz [slip up], derived through the elimination of all
inflection morphemes of the respective verbs (retener [to retain], sostener [to support],
deslizar [to slip])).
2.6.3â•… The structure of compound word
Lastly, we must mention the differences observed in the articulation of the basic
structures that formations created through composition can present. Thus, Lang
(1990:â•›
91–92, 101–125) and Varela Ortega (2005:â•›
74–76, 80–84) distinguish (a)
the structures composed by two or more words that are joined graphically, and
(b) groups of words that, without being joined graphically, constitute a semantic
unit and maintain analogous relations with those presented by a syntagmatic or
Â�
sentence Â�
structure. These authors distinguish within this last group between those
that appear separate, without a link, those that are joined by a preposition and those
constituted by a name and an adjective. But neither Alvar Ezquerra (1993:â•›21, 21–48)
nor Almela Pérez (1999:â•›145–154) attempt any systematization. So, Alvar Ezquerra
includes within composition (see Section 2. of the APPENDIX §): synapse (lexical
units joined by a preposition), disjunction (the lexical units are separated without
a link), Â�
counterposition (the lexical units appear joined by a hyphen), juxtaposition
(the lexical units are joined graphically), along with, as we have already mentioned,
vulgar prefixes, Â�
acronyms, compound abbreviation and complex abbreviation or
initialisms as modalities of shortening. Almela Pérez recognizes only three basic
compound forms: those that are merged phonetically and graphically, which he calls
yuxtaposed compounds; those that appear separated without a link or syntagmatic
compounds, and those that Â�
present an intermediate preposition or prepositional
compounds.
2.7â•… The denomination of word formation processes
Another controversial matter is that there is an excessive terminological Â�
proliferation
in the denomination of processes and concepts. It is also common to find the same
term referring to different processes.4
ïœ´.â•… And as proof of this terminological proliferation we are referring to, we can observe
Notes 6 to 14 of this study.And as examples of uses of the same term for different phenomena,
please compare Notes 9 and 10, on one hand, and 12 and 13 on the other.
	 Word formation processes and proposals for the classification of formal neologisms	 ïœ³ïœµïœµ
3.â•… A classification of formal neologisms
There is no doubt that the fact that the proposals for typologies of word Â�
formation
processes made by the authors do not coincide considerably hinders the task of
classifying lexical units. We believe that this is a taxonomical activity, without any
doubt. It is, however, a necessary task when our aim is to organize something that,
without performing this task, would be merely a chaotic list of lexical units.
We were, clearly, aware of the lack of agreement regarding definitions, types,
Â�
articulations, labels, etc. of the different word formation processes and, at least
Â�
intuitively, of the controversy that could derive from this divergence. But we became
more conscious of the real difficulties thanks to our incorporation in an investiga-
tion project on lexical neology coordinated by the Observatori de Neologia (OBNEO)
of the Institut Universitari de Lingüística Aplicada (IULA) from the University of
Â�
Pompeu Fabra. The main aim of this project is the localization, analysis, description
and Â�
diffusion of new lexical units (neologisms) in Spanish and Catalan. In order to
Â�
fulfil this aim, they extract the content of written texts from the press, oral texts from
the media and other various written publications aimed at the general public. For
this Â�
purpose, the methodology followed at all times is that laid out by the investi-
gation group of the Observatori de Neologia, which has established a protocol with
some Â�
specific Â�
criteria for the localization, selection, classification, representation and
data storage of the neologisms found (see Cabré et al. 2004).5 The analysis of each
new Â�
lexical unit, or possible neologism found, includes the indication of certain
Â�
information. Among this information is the determination of the type of neologism
in question, following the classification of neologisms proposed by the Observatori de
Neologia of the IULA.
This neologism typology (see Section  5 of the APPENDIX§) is based on a
Â�
distinction, which is common among neologists (see Cabré 1993:â•›
447–448; Díaz
ïœµ.â•… For a description of this investigation project, see Díaz Hormigo (2008:â•›18–34), where we
report the investigations in lexical neology performed by the OBNEO and other Â�observatories
of neology,the investigation networks and projects coordinated by the OBNEO,the linguistic
resources available for investigation in lexical neology, the methodology of work carried out
on neology and the IT programs created for detecting neologisms. We, in turn, are part of
this project since a specific agreement was signed between the University of Cádiz and the
University of Pompeu Fabra to participate in the NEOROC network, which studies lexical
creation in Spanish, and to cooperate in the investigation of neology. In this sense, after
founding the investigation group Semaínein, from the University of Cádiz (see initial note of
this study), a line of investigation in neology, we became integrated in this agreement, under
the name NEOUCA, as the node of the NEOROC observatories network, coordinated by the
Observatori de Neologia of the University of Pompeu Fabra.
ïœ³ïœµïœ¶	 María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
Â�
Hormigo 2008:â•›
14–15 for further references), and which takes into account the
resource used for the creation of the new lexical unit. According to this, we can
Â�
distinguish (a) the so-called formal or ordinary neology, or neology of form or of form
and sense, which consists in the creation of either new signifiers or of new signifiers
and Â�
signifies (e.g.: googleadicto [googleaddict], turismática [IT applied to tourism]),
(b) the Â�so-called semantic neology or neology of sense, which is based on the Â�appearance
of new Â�
meanings or nuances for signifiers that are already established in the language
(e.g.: buscador [search engine], parquet [basketball court]), and (c) those under the
name of loanword neology, which refers to lexical units imported from other languages
(e.g.: after hours, mujaidín [Islamic freedom fighter]).
3.1â•… A typology of neologisms
Now, if we observe the classification of the Observatori (see Section  5 of the
Â�APPENDIX§) we can see that, at first sight, there are five types of neologisms. Indeed,
to the already mentioned trichotomy of neologisms of form, semantic neologisms
and loanwords, we must add the type of syntactic neologisms. Although what they
Â�
consist in (see Cabré 2006:â•›231, 233; Cabré 2009:â•›13, 16; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10, 17, 41,
48, 68, 75–76) is not indicated, what is pointed out is that they imply a change of
Â�
grammatical Â�
subcategory (gender, number, change of verbal schema, etc.) in a lexical
base (e.g.: descalificarse Â�
pronominal verb [to be disqualified] (descalificar transitive
verb [to disqualify]), amo de casa masculine [house husband] (ama de casa feminine
Â�
[housewife]). Another Â�
section is added (see Cabré 2006:â•›
231, 234; Cabré 2009:â•›
13,
16; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›11, 19, 41, 50, 69, 77), where, under the label of “Others”, they
include simple, dialectical, argot and classic words or strange cases that are hard to
label, but that are also neological (e.g.: fitipaldi [person who drives quickly], yuyu
[fear or dizziness]).
But for so-called neologisms of form, we must also specify the process of Â�
lexical
Â�
creation that each one is based on. For that purpose there is a list, with definitions,
of twelve mechanisms or subtypes, that are numbered in the following order in the
Â�various Â�publications in which they are mentioned (see Cabré 2006:â•›231; Cabré 2009:â•›13;
Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10, 41, 68): suffixing, prefixing, interferences between suffixing and
Â�
prefixing, composition, classic composition, lexicalization, syntagmation, syntactic
conversion, initialism, acronyms, abbreviation and variation.
3.2â•… A sistematization of the typology
Before going on to analyze the typology presented, we can try and introduce a
certain systematization within this somewhat chaotic list. This is possible if we bear
in mind the definitions and characterizations of each of the processes mentioned (see
Cabré 2006:â•›232–233, 235–240; Cabré 2009:â•›13–15, 18–23; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10–17,
41–48, 68–75).
	 Word formation processes and proposals for the classification of formal neologisms	 ïœ³ïœµïœ·
3.2.1â•… Suffixing, prefixing and interferences between suffixing and prefixing
Indeed, on the one hand we must distinguish (see Cabré 2006:â•›
231, 232, 236–237;
Cabré 2009:â•›
13, 13–14 19–21; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›
10, 11–14, 41, 42–44, 68, 69–72)
neologisms through suffixing, neologisms through prefixing and neologisms through
interferences between suffixing and prefixing. These are means or mechanisms that,
as we have seen in Sections 2.4. and 2.5. of our study, are often included within the
processes of derivation (see Varela Ortega 2005:â•›8–9, 32, as well as Â�
Section 4. of the
APPENDIX §) or addition (see Almela Pérez 1999:â•›
29, as well as Section 1. of the
APPENDIX §). Sometimes, prefixing and suffixing are placed within the resource
of derivation, and the kind that refers to prefixing and suffixing at the same time is
Â�
considered a word formation process with its own autonomy (see Alvar 1993:â•›20, 64,
as well as Section 2. of the APPENDIX § and Lang 1990:â•›241–242, as well as Â�
Section 3.
of the APPENDIX §). This mechanism corresponds with what the above mentioned
authors call either just parasynthesis (Alvar Ezquerra and Lang) or sometimes
circunfixing and sometimes parasynthesis (Varela Ortega 2005:â•›32 and Almela Pérez
1999:â•›29, 187 Note 1). However, these terms are not used to designate this process in
the classification of the Observatori, where they are known as neologisms through
“interferences between suffixing and prefixing” or neologisms through “suffixing or
prefixing”.
3.2.2â•… Composition, classic composition and syntagmation
Similarly, from our point of view, there is another division formed by neologisms
Â�
created through composition, also known – elsewhere in the Observatori’s work
Â�
protocol (see Cabré et al. 2004:â•›
14, 45, 72) – as patronymic composition; neologisms
through Â�
classic composition, and neologisms through syntagmation. These are the
three different means used, according to the Observatori de Neologia (see Cabré
2006:â•›231, 232, 233, 237–238, 239; Cabré 2009:â•›13, 14, 15, 21, 23; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10,
14–15, 16, 41, 45, 46, 68, 72, 73, 74), by the process of lexical composition to create
new words.
3.2.3â•… Lexicalization and syntactic conversion
Inadifferentgroup,wecanincludeneologismsthatareproducedthroughÂ�lexicalization
and neologisms through syntactic conversion (see Cabré 2006:â•›231, 232–233, 238–239;
Cabré 2009:â•›13, 14, 21–23; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10, 15–16, 41, 45–46, 68, 73–74). Both
mechanisms imply a change of grammatical category in the lexical base.
3.2.4â•… Initialism, acronym and abreviation
Another section should be reserved for neologisms through initialism, acronym and
abbreviation (see Cabré 2006:â•›231, 233; Cabré 2009:â•›13, 15; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10, 16,
41, 47, 68, 74–75). What they have in common is that they are based on a process of
reduction or truncation.
ïœ³ïœµïœ¸	 María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
3.2.5â•… Variation
And we will leave to one side neologisms through variation (see Cabré 2006:â•›
231,
233; Cabré 2009:â•›
13, 15; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›
10, 17, 41, 47–48, 68, 75). This name
refers to the formal orthographic variant (neither morphological nor Â�
syntactical) of
a recently Â�
created and, therefore, not yet fixed, lexical unit, or to the formal variant
of a Â�
lexical unit created recently in comparison with another already lexicalized unit
(e.g. Â�
infrastructura, which comes from infraestructura, meaning infrastructure).
3.3â•… The typology of neologisms and word formation processes
We will now go on to discuss this articulation of the typology proposed by the
Â�
Observatori de Neologia of the IULA by relating it to the proposals made for the
Â�
classification of word formation processes we looked at in the first part of our study.
3.3.1â•… Infixing and interfixing
Thus, regarding the first group of processes mentioned, that is, those Â�
commonly
included in derivation or addition, we can see that in the typology of the OBNEO
(see Section 5. of the APPENDIX §, as well as Cabré 2006:â•›231; Cabré 2009:â•›13; Cabré
et al. 2004:â•›10, 41, 68) the means or mechanisms of infixing and interfixing are not
Â�mentioned. Nor does it include regressive derivation caused by subtraction or suppres-
sion of a suffix in the sense proposed by Varela Ortega (2005:â•›31) and Alvar Ezquerra
(1993: 48–49) and partially by Almela Pérez (1999:â•›29–30, 199–202) (see Section 2.6.2.
of this study). Therefore, it is not possible to classify new lexical units (neologisms) that
fit into one of these creation processes. However, those that are the result of Â�
creation
through interfixing could be classified as prefixing or suffixing.
3.3.2â•… Composition
As regards the process of composition, in the typology proposed by the OBNEO
there is a differentiation made between: neologisms formed through classic compo-
sition; those formed through composition, also known as patronymic composition,
and those formed through syntagmation (see Cabré 2006:â•›231, 232, 233, 237–238,
239; Cabré 2009:â•›13, 14, 15, 21, 23; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10, 14–15, 16, 41, 45, 46, 68,
72–73, 74).
3.3.2.1â•… It has been established (see Cabré 2006:â•›
232, 238; Cabré 2009:â•›
14, 21; Cabré
et al. 2004:â•›14–15, 45, 72–73) that neologisms created through Â�
classic Â�
composition are
those that present a prefixed form and a suffixed form (e.g.: Â�biogenia [biogeny], aerófago
[aerophagus], megápolis [megapolis]), a prefixed form and a route (e.g.: autoexigencia
[self-demand], fotoperiodismo [photojournalism], Â�
microvestido [microdress], xeno-
trasplante [xenotransplantation]), or a Spanish route, or one Â�
borrowed from another
language, and a suffixed form (e.g.: clasicómano [classic lover], normógrafo [stencil
	 Word formation processes and proposals for the classification of formal neologisms	 ïœ³ïœµïœ¹
ruler], simpaticoide [friendly]). By prefixed form and Â�
suffixed form we mean classic
particles, which come from Latin and Greek, and Â�
particles created by shortening a
Spanish word.
But we must remember that the process of classic composition is not mentioned
as an independent means or mechanism of composition by any of the authors that
appear in our study. The complex words that result from this process are inserted in the
Â�subtype of so-called orthographic or lexical compounds by Varela Ortega (2005:â•›59–60,
73–74, 74–75) and juxtaposed compounds by Almela Pérez (1999:â•›146–150, 154–160,
as well as pages 59, 69, 104, 133). And they are considered as a particular means or
mechanism of derivation, and not of composition, by Alvar Ezquerra (1993:â•›21, 38,
49–50) and Lang (1990:â•›97, 221).
3.3.2.2â•… The OBNEO also indicates (see Cabré 2006:â•›232, 237–238; Cabré 2009:â•›14,
21; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›
14, 45, 72) that we can also consider to be formed through
composition or patronymic composition those neologisms composed by two routes
(simple or complex), joined graphically or not, judging by the examples, which
respond to the structures verb-noun and noun-noun (e.g.: liberaldemócrata [liberal
democrat], quitahambre [hunger stopper], niño soldado [boy soldier]). And they class
as neologisms through syntagmation (see Cabré 2006:â•›233, 239; Cabré 2009:â•›15, 23;
Cabré et al. 2004:â•›
16, 46, 74) those with a lexicalized syntactic structure that does
not present the structures listed for patronymic composition (e.g.: trabajadora social
[social worker], violencia doméstica [domestic violence], motor de búsqueda [search
engine], sin papeles [undocumented immigrant], en juliana [julienne or matchstick
cut]). Therefore, the distinction seems to be based on the structure of the compounds
and the linguistic categories of the lexical units that take part in the formation.
Other criteria are, therefore, not taken into account in the classification of types of
compounds carried out by the OBNEO, and these criteria are taken into account in
the classification of types of compounds carried out by the authors seen above: the
degree of graphic union of the lexical units involved; the syntactic relation between
the lexical units involved; the semantic relation; the degree of lexicalization of the
resulting formation; the linguistic category of the lexical units that constitute the
compound and the linguistic category of the resulting formation.
And so, according to the characterizations laid out by the OBNEO, the type of
neologism through composition or through patronymic composition would include:
some of the neologisms labelled by Varela Ortega (2005) as orthographic or Â�
lexical
compounds – specifically those that do not contain classic elements –, and all of the
neologisms she calls nominal juxtaposed syntagmatic compounds (see Varela Ortega
2005:â•›
74–76, 80, 81–83); neologisms that Alvar Ezquerra (1993) calls Â�
compounds
through juxtaposition and some of the neologisms considered to be compounds
through disjunction or counterposition (see Alvar Ezquerra 1993:â•›
29–39, 24–27,
27–29); the so-called orthographic or strict compounds and juxtaposed Â�
syntagmatic
ïœ³ïœ¶ïœ°	 María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
compounds labelled by Lang (1990:â•›
101–113, 113–118), and the juxtaposed
Â�
compounds without classic elements, as well as some of Almela’s (1999:â•›
146–150,
150–152) syntagmatic compounds.
The OBNEO’s group of neologisms through syntagmation corresponds to: prepo-
sitional syntagmatic compounds, adjective juxtaposed syntagmatic compounds, and
noun and adjective syntagmatic compounds according to Varela Ortega (2003:â•›80–84);
all of the compounds through synapse and some of the compounds through dis-
junction or counterposition named by Alvar Ezquerra (1993:â•›
24–27, 27–29); Lang’s
(1990:â•›118–125) prepositional syntagmatic compounds and noun and adjective syn-
tagmatic compounds; prepositional compounds and some syntagmatic compounds
labelled by Almela (1999:â•›152–154, 150–152).
3.3.3â•… Syntactic conversion
On the other hand, we must point out that the phenomenon that the OBNEO calls
syntactic conversion (see Cabré 2006:â•›232–233, 239; Cabré 2009:â•›14, 22–23; Cabré et al.
2004:â•›
15–16, 46, 73–74) coincides with what Lang (1990:â•›
35, Â�
193–196) calls regressive
derivation or back formation and Almela Pérez (1999:â•›Â�196–198, 200–202) calls conversion
and regression. The phenomena of conversion and regression are not very clearly
distinguishable – or at least we cannot manage to distinguish them by their definitions
or the examples –. Nevertheless, in the typology established by the OBNEO, we find that
so-called syntactic conversion is related to so-called lexicalization (see Cabré 2006:â•›232,
238; Cabré 2009:â•›14, 21–22; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›15, 45–46, 73). Indeed, it is understood that
some neologisms respond to the process of lexicalization: those that are formed through
the lexicalization of an inflectional form (not of a complete paradigm), normally from
the verb paradigm (e.g.: removida f [removed], encuadernado m [bound], hormigonado
m [cemented]). And they class as neologisms through syntactic conversion those that
are formed thanks to a change of grammatical category without modification in the
lexical base (e.g.: neoliberal m [neoliberal] (documented as an adjective); rediseño m
[redesign] from rediseñar transitive verb [to redesign]; autogestionar transitive verb
[to self-manage] from autogestiónf [self-management]). Therefore, both types imply
a change of grammatical category without modification in the lexical base. However,
lexicalization is the specific denomination given to this process when we are looking
specifically at a verb paradigm (participle or gerund) that is lexicalized or changes to
the noun category. In any case this mechanism or process known as lexicalization is not
treated as a separate process by any of the authors mentioned. Perhaps it is not taken
into account because it does not involve the morphological structure of words and,
therefore, should not be included. Or perhaps because it could be coherently included in
the mechanism of conversion, in the event that this phenomenon is mentioned, as it is
by Almela Pérez (1999:â•›196–198), and as we believe it should have been by the OBNEO.
	 Word formation processes and proposals for the classification of formal neologisms	 ïœ³ïœ¶ïœ±
3.3.4â•… Truncation
Lastly, we refer to the types of lexical creation that are truncated forms or truncations,
that is, they are the result of initialism, acronyms and abbreviation (see Cabré 2006:â•›231,
233; Cabré 2009:â•›13, 15; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›10, 16, 41, 47, 68, 74–75).
3.3.4.1â•… As regards initialisms, those that seem to respond to this process are new
lexical units composed of the corresponding letters of an initialism, that is, Â�
initialist
formations that have been lexicalized (e.g.: a dvd (DVD), a vj (videojockey)) (see Cabré
2006:â•›233; Cabré 2009:â•›15; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›16, 47, 74). The authors named above refer
to this formation process in their definitions of the mechanism they call initialism
(Varela Ortega 2005:â•›
93–93), initialization (Almela Pérez 1999:â•›
210–222), complex
abbreviation or initialism (Alvar Ezquerra 1993:â•›
46–48) and acronym (Lang 1990:â•›
255–258). However, in the OBNEO’s typology, they insist that the formation process
of the intialism itself is not important. What matters is the lexicalization of the result
of that process. This lexicalization is shown in the fact that the initialism has lost some
of its characteristics: it is written in lower case and it is used with inflections of gender
and number or in a different sense than it was originally.
3.3.4.2â•… In turn, the characterization of acronyms as a combination of word Â�
segments
that form a syntagmatic structure (e.g.: cubanglish [Cuban + English]) (see Cabré
2006:â•›
233; Cabré 2009:â•›
15; Cabré et al. 2004:â•›
16, 47, 74) seems to correspond to the
Â�
definition offered by Varela Ortega (2005:â•›
94–99); Almela, in the first sense of the
two that he includes to define this word (see Almela Pérez 1999:â•›205–210), and Alvar
Ezquerra (1993:â•›45). But the IULA’s definition does not specify exactly which Â�fragments
can be omitted and which can be combined.
3.3.4.3â•… According to the IULA (see Cabré 2006:â•›
233; Cabré 2009:â•›
15; Cabré et al.
2004:â•›
16, 47, 75), abbreviation is the shortening of a word or phrase (e.g.: top [top
model], municipales [municipal elections], prota [protagonist], neocon [neoconserva-
tism]). Some of the authors mentioned (see Varela Ortega 2005:â•›89–92); Almela Pérez
1999:â•›202–203; Lang 1990:â•›260–262) refer to the mechanism of phonic reduction of a
single word under the name of shortening. Alvar Ezquerra (1993:â•›44), in turn, consid-
ers abbreviation or truncation to be the reduction of a word’s phonic body, but does
not entirely include it among word formation processes since it is not a morphological
mechanism (see Alvar Ezquerra 1993:â•›45 and Section 2.1. of our study). Almela Pérez
(1999:â•›202–205) uses the term abbreviation to include within it the phonic subtraction
that shortening implies and the graphic reduction brought about by abbreviation. How-
ever, what none of these authors specify is that shortening can mean the reduction or
complete omission of a word or phrase (e.g.: top (as in ‘top model’) and municipales (as
in ‘municipal elections’)). This can be due to the fact that, in the first case, the reduction
is of a merely formal character. The base does not generate a lexical unit that is seman-
tically different to itself, but simply an apocopated form. But the omission of a word
ïœ³ïœ¶ïœ²	 María Tadea Díaz Hormigo
within a phrase promotes or generates a semantic change: the lexical unit that remains
goes on to represent the whole, and adopts the global semantic value of that whole.
4.â•… Conclusions
Thus, the comparative analysis of the different treatises and monographical Â�
studies on
word formation and lexical creation processes has shown us that the Â�
proposals regard-
ing the types of word formation processes do not coincide. It has also shown that there
is no agreement regarding the importance of certain word formation mechanisms, the
classification and articulation of the various processes, the detailed configuration of
each of them, nor the labelling of some mechanisms as lexical Â�
creation resources. And
the increase in diversity is also contributed to by the classification proposals for new
lexical units or neologisms designed. All this Â�
considerably hinders the task of cata-
loguing the lexical units according to the criteria of the creation resource or mecha-
nism on which they are based. In this sense, we feel prepared to formulate two aims,
which we should try and achieve. The first of the two consists in trying to compensate
the disparity observed between most of the theories of the various authors and lin-
guistics schools regarding the definitions, characterizations and classifications of word
formation processes. This can be achieved by presenting a consensus Â�
proposal which,
we believe, could only come about as the result of bringing together their Â�
various pro-
posals. The second – and more feasible – of the two consists in suggesting the cre-
ation of a typology for the classification of neologisms which exactly adjusts to one
of the pre-existing typologies designed by an author or tendency, but not creating or
constructing a different one that would further complicate an already considerably
confusing matter.

The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs
A cognitive analysis*
Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
University of Alicante & Lessius/K. U. Leuven
This chapter analyzes five Spanish verbs related to perception and causation:
iluminar, alumbrar, deslumbrar, vislumbrar and columbrar. Although, apparently,
these verbs may seem synonymous, a careful survey shows that they are not. It
is obvious that the aforementioned verbs share a common etymological feature,
since all of them are related to the Latin noun lumen (light). However, in spite
of their formal and semantic similarities, each of them has developed specific
nuances which justify their existence in the language system. Indeed, each of
these verbs conceptualizes particular aspects concerning the experience in which
light may intervene. Furthermore, their lexical-constructional behavior is placed
along the continuum extended between two opposed poles: one is related to
causativity and the other is linked to visual perception.
Keywords:â•‡ denominal verbs; perception verbs; causativity
1.â•… Introduction
In this paper we will analyze five Spanish verbs related to perception and causativity,
namely iluminar [to iluminate], alumbrar [to light up], deslumbrar [to dazzle], vislum-
brar [to glimpse] and columbrar [to discern]. Although we may be able to infer at first
sight that these verbs are practically synonymous, the truth is that a detailed investiga-
tion into the way they work reveals that they are not. Indeed, all five verbs share a com-
mon denominator of an etymological nature, since they are all related to the Latin base
lumen (LIGHT). However, this shared origin has allowed each of the verbs, despite
coinciding in many of their formal and semantic features, to develop specific nuances
that justify their existence in the linguistic code.
In order to perform our analysis we will use the theoretical frame of Cognitive
Linguistics (from now on, CL), a paradigm of investigation based on various axioms,

such as the belief that language is structured in radial categories with prototypicality;
that metaphors and metonymy are the essential link between specific meanings and
abstract meanings; and that corporal conscience is decisive in the configuration of
linguistics (Lakoff 1987; Lakoff & Johnson 1980; Croft & Cruse 2004).
The CL has also assumed from its beginnings that the unit of grammatical Â�analysis
should be the construction and not the independent lexical units. Constructions
Â�
provide an intrinsic meaning to the scene which conflates with the meaning of the
Â�
different lexical elements. In fact, for authors such as Langacker (1987, 1991, 1999),
there is a continuum between lexicon and grammar, which means there cannot be
form without meaning. Furthermore, in every conceptualization there is always a
Â�
conceptualizer (from now on, C), which is the speaker that builds the scene from its
subjective point of view and orientates it deictically.
Having accepted this theoretical framework, over the following pages we will go
on to develop the study of our five verbs using a data corpus. Following this Â�
inductive
procedure (from empirical data to theoretical considerations) we will attempt to
Â�
provide an answer to the following working hypotheses:
In spite of the conceptual similarities that occur between the five verbs under
study, we will argue that they are not synonymous; each one has its semantic
differences as regards the rest.
The different conceptualizations that can be expressed by these verbs are not
equivalent, but some are more prototypical than others. This prototypicality is
motivated by semantic and pragmatic factors.
There is an iconic correlation between the syntactic form of each
conceptualization and its conceptual content, meaning formal variations will add
communicative differences.
The base noun for these verbs (lumen) limits the meanings they have
developed in Spanish. Similarly, this semantic nucleus (LIGHT) will connect
these verbs to certain universal patterns of conception of reality.
We believe that between iluminar, alumbrar, deslumbrar, columbrar and
vislumbrar there are connections and differences that allow us to draw a continuum
between them, which would go from a causative pole (expression of a strength that
generates a state) to a perceptive pole (perception of a phenomenon of reality).
In short, we will argue that the conceptual field of LIGHT makes it possible for Â�multiple
verbs to exist, each one able to codify various domains of the cognitive experience of
the speakers.

Verbs of perception as a linguistic category
Verbs of physical perception are lexical units in charge of linguistically expressing
contact with the surroundings, making use of all five body senses, meaning there are
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ·ïœ±
verbs of visual, auditive, tactile, smelling and tasting perception. These verbs Â�constitute
a particularly interesting conceptual domain for linguistics in general and for CL
in Â�
particular because studying them shows the strong interaction between sensory
Â�
experience, language and cognition.1
One of the problems typically associated with perception verbs is their difficult
classification from a grammatical point of view. Their morpho-syntactic behavior is
so heterogeneous that it is hard to establish a single classification which fits them all.
Indeed, these verbs can function as auxiliary verbs, as pseudo-copulative verbs and
even as discourse markers. They allow all kinds of complements, such as Â�
nominal
complements (specific and abstract), infinitive and gerund clauses, completive
phrases, indirect interrogative phrases, etc. As regards semantics, perception verbs
are among the most elemental verbs in every language (and, therefore, among the
most used), which explains why they are often so controversial. For all these reasons,
Â�
physical perception verbs, and particularly those of vision and audition, are hugely
complex linguistic units.
Viberg (1984), based on data from various languages, proposed one of the best
known perception verb taxonomies, according to which there are three basic types of
perception verbs: active perception verbs, pure perception verbs (or experience verbs)
and copulative perception verbs. As pointed out by Horno Chéliz (2008), this Â�
typology
is based on the aspectual theory of events posed for the first time in the classic work of
Vendler (1967). This way, active perception verbs represent an activity event, where we
have an animated subject that voluntarily carries out an action with one of its percep-
tive organs during a given period of time in the hope of examining a specific stimulus.
Spanish examples of active perception verbs of different senses would be mirar [to look]
(sight), saborear [to savour] (taste) or acariciar [to stroke] (touch).
Pure perception verbs aspectually represent an achievement, not an activity. They
represent an event of involuntary experience, where the subject perceives a stimulus
unintentionally. These perception events occur when a stimulus reaches a part of the
body and this body part (e.g. the eye) decodes it spontaneously, without the subject
being able to avoid it. Examples of this type of verbs can be found in sentir [to feel], a
multimodal verb that can express almost any sensory perception, and in many cases,
ver and oír.2
ïœ±.â•… For an updated approach to the multiple and complex properties of perception verbs
you may consult, among others, the following works: Rodríguez Espineira (2000, 2004);
Â�
García-Miguel (2005); Roegiest (2003); Enghels (2007); Ibarretxe-Antuñano (1999, 2003,
2008); Hanegreefs (2008); Soares da Silva (2004); Fernández Jaén (2006, 2008).
ïœ².â•… The verbs ver and oír in Spanish can express both active perception and pure perception.
A syntactic analysis of this phenomenon can be found in Fernández Jaén (2006).
ïœ³ïœ·ïœ²	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
Lastly, copulative perception verbs represent a state and not strictly an event. This
possibility is, in turn, subdivided in two types. On the one hand, copulative perception
verbs can conceptualize an ability of the subject; the ability to posess a given sense.
Such is the case of the phrase Paula no oye sin su audífono [Paula cannot hear without
her hearing aid], where oír lexicalizes the ability of hearing. On the other, these verbs
can also have a syntactic subject that represents the sensory stimulus. In these cases,
the verb has an intransitive structure in which the presence of a stimulus is focussed
on as well as on its potentiality to be perceived, leaving the perceiver off the scene,
reduced to the role of C. This occurs in sentences like Esta canción se oye bien [this
song is easy to hear], Desde aquí se ve la montaña [you can see the mountain from
here] or La camisa huele a rosas [the shirt smells of roses], where the subjects (canción,
montaña and camisa) represent the objects that can be perceived through hearing,
sight and smell.
This classification should not be taken as something final, but as a continuum of
fuzzy boundaries in which the different types often overlap. In fact, very often percep-
tion verbs can be included in more than one of these groups, or in all three of them.
This flexibility is brought about by the very semantic nature of the perception verbs
and by the pragmatic conditions that control the use speakers make of them.
In all perception scenes we can find a series of recurring elements. Firstly, you have
a PERCEIVER, i.e. an animated entity (often human) that perceives something with
one of his senses. There is also a PERCEPT,3 the perceived object or sensory stimulus
sensed by the PERCEIVER. We must also add a distance factor (Bat-Zeev Shyldkrot
1989), the distance that separates PERCEPTOR from PERCEPT; this distance can limit
perception and even rule it out. For example, in order to oír [to hear] something, it
is possible to have a certain distance between perceiver and percept, but in order to
be able to escucharlo [to listen to it] both participants need to be closer to each other.
Â�Furthermore, the physical space that separates PERCEIVER and PERCEPT has enabled
certain verbs of vision like mirar [to look] to develop prepositional structures that
Â�
represent the spatial path drawn by sight until it reaches the PERCEPT (Hanegreefs
2007 2008). Therefore, perception is not stable, but varies due to the circumstances in
which it takes place. Sometimes, the PERCEIVER is in full control of the situation and
can scrutinize the PERCEPT at ease. In other circumstances the PERCEPT is fleeting
or brief, or sporadic, which complicates its perception, in the same way as distance
Â�sometimes cancels the PERCEIVER’s possibility of success, for example when we intend
to look at something that is far away. To this we must add that each physical sense is
conditioned by its own physiological particularities, which supports the fact that it is
difficult to establish a single pattern of operation for these verbs.
ïœ³.â•… We borrow the term percept from Bolinger (1974).
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ·ïœ³
One of the most debated matters in publications on perception verbs is how to
assign semantic roles to the PERCEIVER and the PERCEPT, a problem which is, in turn,
related to the way in which these two concepts materialize syntactically. At first it seems
logical for the PERCEIVER to be identified with the proto-role of Â�
PROTO-AGENT,
while the PERCEPT would correspond to the PROTO-PATIENT (Dowty 1991). For
Dowty a PROTO-AGENT conceptually represents an entity that is in control of the
action, that acts intentionally, is the cause of an event and has an independent existence
from that event. The PROTO-PATIENT would, in turn, represent the entity controlled
andaffectedbytheevent,anentitythatcanbephysicallyalteredbytheÂ�PROTO-AGENT.
Therefore, the relation between these two proto-roles is asymmetrical; one of them, the
agent, has greater conceptual prominence than the other. Naturally, on a syntactic level,
the PROTO-AGENT is usually the syntactic subject and the PROTO-PATIENT tends
to act as the Direct object. Let us see some examples:
	(1)	
Sonia saboreó el helado con mucho placer. [Sonia savoured the ice cream with
great delight]
	(2)	
Luis tocó tanto el jarrón que acabó rompiéndolo. [Luis touched the vase so
much that it ended up breaking]
	(3)	El sumiller degustó los vinos para poder elegir el más apropiado. [The Â�sommelier
tasted the wines in order to choose the most suitable one]
In examples (1–3) there are three syntactic subjects (Sonia, Luis & el sumiller) that fit
perfectly in with the theoretical notion of PROTO-AGENT; all three are the motor of
the predication, they entirely control the action (to the extent that they can be held
responsible for the consequences, as we can see in example (2), where the Â�
consecutive
sentence que acabó rompiéndolo derives from the previous action of tocar). They
also describe intentional actions, meaning there can even be a subordinate sentence
Â�
indicating the aim, as in (3): para poder elegir el más apropiado. In turn, the direct
objects el helado, el jarrón and los vinos would be PROTO-PATIENTS, since they are
in a situation of complete subordination and change state (in a physical sense) after the
perceptive action. Nonetheless, the truth is that outside the more prototypical cases
with verbs of touch and taste, this schematic idealization is not always so clear. Let us
look at the following sentences:
	(4)	
Geoffrey vio el partido de fútbol en su casa. [Geoffrey watched the football
match at home]
	(5)	
El estudiante ha mirado el cuadro durante una hora. [The student has looked
at the painting for an hour]
	(6)	
A Carolina le encanta escuchar buena música. [Carolina loves listening to
good music]
	(7)	
En cuanto abrí la puerta olí el perfume que llevabas. [As soon as I opened the
door I smelt the perfume you were wearing]
ïœ³ïœ·ïœ´	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
In these cases the relation between PERCEIVER and PERCEPT is less typical. Strictly
speaking, none of the syntactic subjects (Geoffrey, el estudiante, Carolina or the elided
subject yo [me]) actually carry out an action, since their link with the event is more
abstract. It is true that the subjects from (4), (5) and (6) have an intention (to enjoy
the match, to analyze the painting or to delight oneself with music), but in order to
fulfil it they do not act in a literal sense, or at least the action is not evident. The case
of (7) is even less prototypical because there is no kind of intentionality, and the event
lasts a minimal amount of time, since oler [to smell] something unexpectedly is con-
ceptualized as an instantaneous achievement in which the subject cannot intervene
(Fernández Jaén 2008). The perceived elements el partido de fútbol, el cuadro, la buena
música and el perfume do not represent a true PROTO-PATIENT either, since they are
not affected by the sensory action in any degree and they exist with full independence
of being perceived or not.
Occasionally, the PERCEPTS seem to be so far from the PERCEIVER or are so
difficult to detect due to pragmatic conditions so that the sentence is conceptualized in
a different way, as is illustrated below:
	â•‡(8)â•… Desde aquí se ve la catedral. [You can see the cathedral from here]
	â•‡(9)â•…
La cima fue vista por el escalador tras superar el campamento base. [The
peak was seen by the climber after passing the base camp]
	(10)â•…
De madrugada aún se oían las notas de la orquesta. [At dawn you could still
hear the notes from the orchestra]
	(11)â•… La cocina huele a quemado. [The kitchen smells of burnt]
All these sentences are examples of what Viberg (1984) calls copulative perception
with subject-stimulation, stative perception: the syntactic subjects la catedral, la cima,
las notas de la orquesta and la cocina represent the semantic PERCEPT. Why is the
PERCEPT conceptualized as a syntactic subject here? Where is the PERCEIVER? In
these cases the PERCEIVER understands, on an experiential level, that the stimulus is
uncontrollable, and that perceiving it does not depend on the perceiver himself at all.
Sentence (8) could easily be emitted from a hotel room from which the cathedral is
visible, but it would seem wrong if the speaker emitted it standing right in front of the
cathedral; since standing in front of it, the perceiver would be able to control the visual
perception – and would use a transitive structure as in (4) –. However whether the
cathedral is visible or not from the room is an eventuality that does not depend on the
PERCEIVER. This means the scene is configured in such way that the visual Â�
stimulus
itself is the subject, pushing the PERCEIVER into the background, off the scene. The
same happens in (9), only in this case, the possibility of seeing the peak depends on a
specific condition (to pass the base camp), so perception becomes Â�
possible after that
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ·ïœµ
step, and even partly controllable.4 In (10), musical notes can be heard even from
far away without the PERCEIVER being able to avoid it, while in (11) the smell that
Â�
emanates from the kitchen invades physical space and reaches whoever goes by in a
completely random fashion.
For all these reasons, the scale of agentivity of Van Valin and LaPolla (1997) is
very useful, according to which the thematic role of the syntactic subject with per-
ception verbs is gradual, going from the most agentive (AGENT) to the less agentive
(STIMULUS or PATIENT), with intermediate cases. Furthermore, this scale ties in
with Dowty’s proto-roles and their aspectual consequences: the closer the subject is
to the PROTO-AGENT, the greater its control and the closer it gets to transitivity
(actions); and the closer the subject is to the PROTO-PATIENT, the lesser its control
and and the closer it gets to intransitivity (states), as shown in the following Figure:
AGENT < OBSERVER < PERCEIVER < GOAL/STIMULUS < PATIENT
ACTIVITIES ACHIEVEMENTS STATES
+ agentive
+ control
+ transitive
– agentive
– control
– transitive
Figure 1.â•‡ Scale of agentivity with perception verbs
This continuous conception of agentivity with sensory perception adequately
explains all cases. Perception events such as tocar [to touch], saborear [to savour], or
degustar [to taste] would be at the left end of the scale, since they are prototypical
actions. Verbs like mirar or escuchar would also be highly agentive (since they focus on
the voluntary attention the PERCEIVER has for the PERCEPT): since the PERCEPT
is not actually ‘affected’ by actions such as mirar [to look] or escuchar [to listen], their
ïœ´.â•… For this reason, sentence (8) is a reflexive passive and (9) a passive sentence with an
agent complement (el escalador).In visual and auditive copulative perception reflexive passive
sentences indicate states, i.e. they indicate that the stimulus is everlasting (without temporal
boundaries) and, visible/audible if the necessary conditions are fulfilled, whereas passive
Â�
sentences express achievements, perceptions that occur automatically as soon as a given
Â�condition is fulfilled.Once that condition is fulfilled (passing the base camp),the Â�PERCEIVER
can have some control over the perceptive action (as soon as the climber sees the peak he is
free to enjoy the contemplation) and can (optionally) appear as an agent complement. For a
detailed analysis of these structures, see the works of Fernández Lagunilla (2006) and Horno
Chéliz (2008).
ïœ³ïœ·ïœ¶	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
subjects are less prototypical agents and could qualify as OBSERVERS. Ver [to see] and
oír [to hear] would be in the intermediate area, fluctuating – according to the case –
between fairly agentive and totally unagentive.5 Lastly, oler [to smell] tends towards the
right hand side due to the fact that the sense of smell is the least controlled in human
beings, which explains why its prototypical configuration is intransitive, although it
can also sporadically appear in transitive structures – such as those in (7)6 –.
Another frequently discussed matter is that of the semantic universal elements of
perception. Bearing in mind that the physiological and biological properties involved
in perception processes are the same for every person in the world, should we expect
there to be certain universality in the metaphorical projections that perception
verbs generate? Sweetser (1990) proposed a well-known list of semantic changes in
Â�
Indo-European languages that has been considered valid for many languages of the
world. According to Sweetser, vision is associated to fields such as KNOWLEDGE
and CONTROL, while verbs of hearing usually metaphorically express both KNOWL-
EDGE and OBEDIENCE, since hearing something and understanding tend to imply a
certain reaction (idea of obedience). The sense of touch, however, is linked to notions
such as EMOTION, i.e. much more subjective ideas than those generated by the senses
of sight and hearing. Lastly, senses of smell and taste are related to EMOTION and
EVOCATION, i.e. to memories and feelings. These practically universal metaphors7
have a strong biological motivation; eyes and ears are the organs that most help us to
get to know the world, so it is not strange that verbs related to these senses should often
codify epistemic content. On the contrary, skin, sense of smell and of taste show us
reality in a more diffuse way, in which subjective interpretation is greater.
Lastly, it is necessary to mention the conceptual link between verbs of visual and
auditive perception in various Romance languages, on the one hand, and causative
verbs like hacer [to make] or dejar [to leave], on the other. Recently, several authors have
investigated similarities and differences between these verbs in various Â�
languages from
different functionalist proposals, particularly with the aim of explaining their Â�
syntactic
behavior with infinitive clauses and completive sentences (Achard 1996; Soares da Silva
2004; Rodríguez Espiñeira 2004). Let us observe the following sentences:
ïœµ.â•… Naturally, in cases of pure perception the subject would simply act as a PERCEIVER,
completely lacking any intention or control.
ïœ¶.â•… Fernández Jaén (2008) draw this conclusion on the basis of statistical analyses.
ïœ·.â•… There are languages that alter this metaphorical distribution, whereby we can state that
it is not entirely universal. For example, there are cultures where KNOWLEDGE is usually
Â�
expressed by verbs related to the senses of smell and taste. Regarding this topic, you may
consult the works of Danesi (1985 1990) and Ibarretxe Antuñano (2008).
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ·ïœ·
	 (12)	
Andrés dejó que su hijo fuera al cine. [Andrés allowed that his son went
to the cinema]
	 (13)	
Andrés vio que su hijo iba al cine. [Andrés saw that his son was going to

	 (15)	
Jaime hizo caer al suelo la estructura. [Jaime made the structure fall to
the floor]
	 (16)	
Jaime oyó caer al suelo la estructura. [Jaime heard the structure fall to
the floor]
In examples (12) and (13) we find two sentences in which dejar and ver are com-
plemented by their corresponding completive sentences acting as direct objects.
Â�
However, in spite of their structural resemblance, the scene represented in each case
is very different. In both sentences the inflected subordinate clause conceptualizes
information as an event with temporal boundaries, as a concluded fact. Nevertheless,
the relation between the syntactic subject of the main sentence (Andrés) and that of
the subordinate clause is very different in each case. In (12) Andrés is the cause that
makes the action possible, he must allow the event to occur. This control exerted
by the subject over the subordinate predication is shown in the verb’s mood, which
is the subjunctive (fuera) since it depends on the eventuality of the external cause.
However, in (13) Andrés is not the cause of the event, but merely a witness: he sees,
without intervening in any way, how his son looks at the program, picks up his jacket
and goes to the cinema, all of which are actions that make his perception of the scene
be Â�
conceived as a perception of a phenomenon of reality. That is why, in this case, the
verb ver [to see] expresses a cognitive perception (intellectual comprehension of the
event) configured in the form of a copulative sentence. Also, since Andrés does not
take part in the event, the subordinate clause occurs simultaneously with the visual
perception – contrary to what occurs in (12), where it comes afterwards – and the
verb is in the indicative mood.
In contrast to examples (12) and (13), sentences (14) to (17) show cases of infini-
tival complementation. These peculiar structures are not conceptualized as facts or
propositions with temporal boundaries, but as events, because the non-inflexed form
of the infinitive lacks any kind of temporal embedding and represents an ongoing
event. The infinitive clause conceptualizes the subordinate event in a more dynamical
way than completive sentences. As such, the subordinate event can receive various
semantic nuances depending on the main verb. In examples (14) and (15), the caus-
ative verbs dejar [to let] and hacer [to make] indicate that Jaime is the cause of the
event, which takes place solely because the main subject allows for it. Even so, there
is a significant difference between the two causative structures that can be explained
by Talmy’s force dynamics (1988 2000). Whereas in (14) the scene is conceptualized
as if la estructura [the structure] (the logical subject of the infinitive) is inclined to
ïœ³ïœ·ïœ¸	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
fall (perhaps it was already damaged), in (15) the use of the verb hacer implies that
the structure offers a certain counterforce: it is a very solid structure, so in order for
it to fall the cause must be more intense. For this reason, in (14) the causative verb
is dejar, a verb that metaphorically conceptualizes the idea of PERMISSION (the
Â�
barrier that Â�
prevented the event from reaching its natural state is unblocked), whereas
in (15) hacer is used to represent the idea of an action that seeks to rule out a state
that resists change. In turn, sentences (16) and (17) include a main subject that is
merely the direct witness to the event, but does not intervene in its occurrence; the
only Â�
difference between the two sentences being the sense involved in the perception:
sight or Â�
hearing. In short, the causative verbs hacer and dejar and verbs of perception
show that Â�
speakers can Â�
intervene in the state of things around them in order to change
it (causation) or can simply register it by means of one of their senses. In any case, the
syntactic structure they use to express their experience will prove how it occurred and
what level of responsibility they had in it.8
As we have shown, perception verbs are a particularly heterogeneous linguistic
category, characterized by their structural complexity and semantic richness. In the
following sections we will analyze the five verbs that constitute the object of our study
aiming to explain their properties and the place they take up in the general framework
of perception verbs.
3.â•… Analysis
The verbs iluminar [to illuminate], alumbrar [to light up], deslumbrar [to dazzle],
Â�
vislumbrar [to glimpse] and columbrar [to discern] are all denominal verbs, i.e. they are
terms created morphologically through the process of parasynthesis form a Â�
previous
base of a nominal nature, a noun. In the case of our verbs, they all (directly or Â�indirectly)
stem from the Latin word lumen,9 which in Latin means LIGHT and, through
Â�
various metonymic extensions, it also refers to DAYLIGHT, DAY, LAMP, CANDLE,
WINDOW (place through which the light comes in), CLARITY or Â�
BRIGHTNESS.
ïœ¸.â•… As pointed out by Rodríguez Espiñeira (2004), causative verbs with subordinate events
express deontic modality (something must happen, there is an idea of obligation), whereas
perception verbs express epistemic modality (the speaker’s knowledge of the world increases
after perceiving a specific occurrence). Furthermore, the event with causatives does not
exist until the causer acts (greater agentivity), as opposed to what happens with perception
verbs, whose subordinate events have an existence of their own, independent from the main
Â�
predication (Roegiest 2003).
ïœ¹.â•… The Spanish word lumbre comes from lumen, a term that in the medieval age meant
BODY THAT SHEDS LIGHT, until it was affected by a process of semantic specification and
came to mean FLAME or FIRE (Corominas & Pascual 1980–1991).
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ·ïœ¹
Also, on a metaphorical level, lumen can mean EYES, LIGHT IN THE EYES10 or
ORNAMENT (something that is beautiful because it shines). This great semantic
variety emanates from the general conception of what is luminous: LIGHT is a very
primitive cognitive category in our conception of the world, a truly anthropological
universal. The human being is an essentially visual creature that has depended greatly
on sight during evolution. For some primates that eat insects and live in trees having
good sight is less important, because their main activity occurs Â�
during the night, but
this is not the case of the Homo sapiens. Our ancestors conquered the ground thousands
of years ago and on a terrestrial level sight is decisive for both hunting and defence,
and human eyes cannot see without light (Fernández Jaén 2008; Ballester 2009). For all
these reasons, it is not surprising that this simple term, lumen, should lead to such a rich
array of concepts, some of which are directly linked to very ancient feelings.
How are these ideas transferred to our verbs? Each of them has lexicalized the
Â�
possible ramifications of the original noun in a particular way. To prove this, all we
need to do is to examine the different meanings of these terms found in the DEA
Â�(Diccionario del Español Actual) by Seco (1999):
Iluminar
1.	 To shed light [on someone or something].
2.	 To decorate [something] with lights.
3.	 To teach [someone] the truth, knowledge or correct behavior.
4.	 To add colours [to something].
Alumbrar
1.	 To project light [on a place].
2.	 To turn on [a light] or make it shine.
3.	 To give birth [to a child].
4.	 To discover and bring to the surface [something that was underground].
5.	 To bring to the light or clarify [something].
6.	 To shine or sparkle (intransitive).
7.	 To be born (intransitive).
8.	 To get drunk (intransitive).
ïœ±ïœ°.â•… The relation between light and eyes is very ancient. Many philosophers from ancient
Greece thought that eyes shed light on the object of perception, an idea that was later refuted
by Aristotle (Korsmeyer 2002). We might also mention the entire rhetorical compendium of
European poetry (particularly of love), where metaphors linking beauty to light and bright-
ness (your eyes are like the sun,the twinkle in your eye,etc.) are frequent.In fact,the semantic
relation between eyes and light is so strong that both concepts are etymologically related in
some languages. For example, in Breton and Cornish, two Celtic languages, the forms for the
meanings of EYES lagad and lagat come from the Indo-European root *lauk-, from which the
Latin noun lux (LIGHT) also appeared (Ballester 2009).
ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ°	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
Deslumbrar
1.	 To temporarily blind [someone] with a very bright light, or someone or Â�something
that produces or reflects it.
2.	 To admire or greatly impress [someone] with the splendour or brightness of
someone or something that possesses it.
Columbrar
1.	 To descry or see from far away with little clarity.
2.	 To see or perceive [something].
3.	 To guess [something] through signs.
Vislumbrar
1.	 To see indistinctly.
A first examination of the lexicographical information found in the DEA invites
us to reflect on certain things. According to the list of meanings, it seems that alumbrar
is more frequent than the rest, due to a greater polisemy. We can also see that despite
their shared origin and various related components, there are different modulations in
each one of the five verbs. Are these semantic extensions specific to each verb or can
they be lexicalized by any of them? What do these verbs truly have in common and
what differentiates them? Also, it seems that some of these verbs are linked to causativ-
ity (to make something have light), whereas others, such as columbrar and vislumbrar,
are clearly verbs of visual perception. Is this really so? Furthermore, there are syntactic
structures that are not represented in this list. Are they really used or not?
In order to answer all these questions, we have analyzed various random samples
of real occurrences of these five verbs using the CREA database (Corpus de referencia
del español actual). We have also applied some restrictive criteria to keep the analysis
within manageable proportions (see Table 1): we worked solely with Spanish texts,
belonging to three genres: literature, press and oral texts.
Table 1.â•‡ Absolute frequency of occurrences
Literature Press Oral Total
Iluminar 1343 204 26 1573
Alumbrar 286 64 12 362
Deslumbrar 265 58 9 332
Vislumbrar 57 44 3 104
Columbrar 21 1 – 22
This table reveals an interesting fact. As opposed to what we may infer from the
Â�lexicographical information, iluminar is by far the most documented verb of the series.
Alumbrar and deslumbrar obtain similar frequencies of use, whereas the verbs of visual
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ±
perception vislumbrar and columbrar are clearly unusual in modern Spanish. Next, we
will go on to analyze each one of these verbs individually and we will represent the
results obtained from our empirical research. To this end, we will bear in mind both
the postulates of CL and the constructionalist models of linguistic analysis.
3.1â•… Iluminar
The Spanish verb iluminar derives from the Latin verb illumināre, that, for its part,
stems from the noun lumen. The close resemblance between both forms has made it
possible for iluminar to develop various very similar meanings. The schematic Â�
content
of iluminar is that of PROJECTING LIGHT: an entity sheds a light that reaches another
entity and automatically makes it have light too. This conceptual image allows various
lexico-constructional conceptualizations. Each conceptualization shows how the C
(the speaker that gives his point of view) constructs the scene, being highly influenced
by his own sensory experience.
The initial conceptualization (see Figure 2) is the one with a HUMAN subject that
projects light on another entity (Direct object).11
c
Figure 2.â•‡ Iluminar with a human (agentive) object
	 Let us now look at an example:
	(1)	Tolibio se había puesto de pie ante la pantalla. Beruelo le iluminó con la linterna
[Tolibio had stood up in front of the screen. Beruelo shone the torch on him]
 (M. Díez Rodríguez, El expediente del náufrago 1992)
Here, Beruelo is the agent that intentionally projects light on something (in this case, a
person).Theseexamplesareveryrareinthesamplesanalyzed.Inthis Â�conceptualization
there is usually an instrumental complement added that specifies the element with
which the subject projects the light. Nevertheless, even without specifying the instru-
ment, the sentence would still be correct because, metonymically, the receiver infers
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… The three-dimensional rectangle generically represents the entity that receives light.
The dotted lines that link to the conceptualizer C indicate that it represents a scene from an
Â�
objective external view of the process (epistemic deixis).
ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ²	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
that Beruelo illuminated Tolibio with a luminous object, since human beings do not
shed light. However, normally, according to the principle of iconicity, if an element is
conceptually relevant, it should be codified in the scene. So, manner and instrument
are often specified in the sentence.
This same conceptualization can be used metaphorically to express more abstract
meanings. As we mentioned in the introduction, in the CL framework metaphors
are considered to be the vehicles by which sensory experience gets transformed into
notional information (Lakoff & Johnson 1980). Thus, the pattern abovementioned
allows us to create sentences linked to many conceptual extensions. Let us look at
example (2):
	(2)â•…
Seréis mejores ciudadanos si sabéis iluminar vuestro espíritu con la verdad del
Â�evangelio [You will be better citizens if you are able to illuminate your spirit
with the gospel] (J.J. Benítez, Caballo de Troya 1 1984)
This sentence transfers all the above-mentioned components to a metaphorical level.
Here, the HUMAN subject does not illuminate a physical entity, but a Â�
metaphysical
entity (your spirit) and it does so, not with a torch, but with an abstract religious
Â�
instrument (with the truth of the gospel). So, an abstract event – viz. the truth of
the gospel that illuminates the spirit, giving it light and, therefore, making it more
Â�virtuous – is patterned with the specific physical experience of illuminating Â�something.
Â�Naturally, this metaphorical projection is based on the conceptual metaphor LIGHT IS
GOOD: due to its biological and cultural importance, light usually represents positive
elements, even on an abstract level, as in example (2).
A different conceptualization is the one in which the subject entity is NOT
HUMAN, but objectival: it represents objects that possess a light of their own, such
as lanterns, lamps or candles, and also natural phenomena such as stars, the sun, the
moon, etc. Naturally, in this construction (see Figure 3), the syntactic subject is no
longer agentive, that is to say, it lacks intentionality.
ï¿¼
c
Figure 3.â•‡ Iluminar with a non human (unagentive) subject
This construction covers about 50% of the analyzed examples with iluminar, so
it can be considered prototypical. The greater occurrence of the unagentive concep-
tualization is probably due to the way speakers experience reality: the appearance of
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ³
light, natural (day light, the light of dawn) or artificial (street lamps, spotlights), is
usually something uncontrollable, something that happens in an unexpected or even
programmed way.
	(3)	
La luz primaveral ilumina el sobrecargado gabinete [The light of spring lights
up the overcrowded office] (R. Hernández, El secreter delRey 1995)
In example (3), a ray of light penetrates into a given place following the laws of nature,
that is, it is neither intentional nor optional. The light of spring is simply part of the
surroundings and C codifies it as a syntactic subject that appears at a given moment.
Of course, this structure, just like the previous one, also allows metaphorical mapping,
as illustrated in (4):
	(4)	
Una lucecita divina ilumina la oscuridad tenebrosa de mis pensamientos
[A divine little light illuminates the gloomy darkness of my thoughts]
 (J. Sierra i Fabra, El regreso de Johnny Pickup 1995)
Here, as in example (3), the writer opts for the unagentive conceptualization to
explain in the first person a moment of personal crisis. A (divine) light is shed onto
bad thoughts so as to make them positive. This example perfectly illustrates the meta-
phorical opposition based on the presence or absence of light: LIGHT IS GOOD and
DARKNESS IS BAD. For that reason, bad thoughts are gloomy and the solution is a
divine light. Moreover, the fact that light is an uncontrollable and unexpected phe-
nomenon presupposes that the remedy against bad thoughts is a hazardous process,
depending on an external intervention (and not on C). As we can see, the schema is
perfectly conserved, only the semantic field has changed.
Iluminar also allows for another lexico-constructional possibility with an Â�
Indirect
object, that is both possible with a HUMAN and a NON HUMAN subject. This
Â�
Indirect object represents the entity (normally animated) that benefits from the verbal
action and corresponds to what Dowty (1991) calls the PROTO-RECEIVER: the last
link in the process, the figure onto which the energy of the predication is transferred.
The following Figure represents a basic mental image of this construction with a NON
HUMAN subject (left) and with a HUMAN subject (right).
c c
Figure 4.â•‡ Iluminar with a +/- human subject and Indirect object
ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ´	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
Our analysis undoubtedly shows that the presence of an Indirect complement on
the scene of iluminar is totally peripheral, even with HUMAN subjects: a luminous
instrument is rarely used to favour another person, it merely serves to fulfil a punctual,
given need of the agentive subject. In combination with a NON HUMAN subject the
presence of a beneficiary (or Indirect complement) seems even stranger, bearing in
mind that in these cases the subject of the sentence does not represent an intentional
or willing entity. Let us take a look at some of the few examples found:
	(5)â•…
[…] al tiempo que el haz de luz de alguna farola le iluminaba el rostro
[…while a ray of light from a lamp post lit up his face]
 (J. M. Guelbenzu, El río de la luna 1981)
	(6)â•…
¡Y qué terrible cuando esos dioses le iluminaban con sus ojos fosforescentes
los Â�
sótanos de la memoria! [And how terrible when those gods illuminated
the Â�
basement of his memory with their phosphorescent eyes]
 (J. Ferrero, Opium 1986)
	(7)â•…
[…] desde que tenía memoria, cuando cada tarde le iluminaba la vida la
Â�
inminencia de la llegada de su padre […for as long as he could remember,
when every evening the imminence of his father’s arrival lit up his life]
 (A. Muñoz Molina, Sefarad. Una novela de novelas 2001)
In example (5) we have a NON HUMAN subject (the ray of light from a lamp post),
a Direct object (his face) and an Indirect object expressed by the clitic le. Clearly, the
Â�
syntactic subject lacks any will of its own, regardless of whether it gains anything from
the situation of being illuminated. We must also note that, in this case, the Indirect
object constitutes what, in traditional grammar, was known as the possessive dative,
since the Direct object (the face) is an inalienable property of the beneficiary.
Examples (6) and (7) are of a metaphorical nature. In (6) an anthropomorphic
entity (the gods) illuminates the basement of his memory (the memory of a PROTO-
RECEIVER) with their phosphorescent eyes (instrument). On this abstract level, where
illuminating the basement of his memory approximately means TO MAKE HIM
REMEMBER (the memories are in a dark basement and can only be recovered if there
is light), you could say the gods have a certain intentionality, since they wish for the
individual to remember, and voluntarily project light upon his thoughts. The case of
(7) is a little more complex. Here, we have an abstract syntactic subject that does not
represent a well-defined entity: what illuminates the boy’s (Indirect complement) life
(Direct complement) is the imminence of his father’s arrival. That experience the boy
lived in his childhood and looked forward to so often makes the boy very happy, which
is why the writer expresses this happiness with the verb iluminar: following the meta-
phor LIGHT IS GOOD, the boy’s life gets better (he has more light and, therefore,
more happiness) when he believes that his father is about to arrive.
In various cultures LIGHT is also associated to beauty: light is considered to be
beautiful, as is whatever possesses it. Therefore, it is not surprising that iluminar can
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¸ïœµ
also mean TO ADORN. In these cases, iluminar clearly functions as a causative verb
since it refers to a process aimed at changing the properties of an object. This way, the
agentive illuminating subject by shedding light on the object makes it more beautiful.
Let us consider the following example of iluminar with the meaning of TO ADORN.
	(8)â•…
[…] se entregaba en aquellos momentos a la tarea de iluminar el salón – ¿Te
gusta?, preguntó, al ver que él la observaba desde fuera […at that moment she
was busy with the task of illuminating the sitting room – Do you like it?, she
asked, seeing he was watching her from outside.]
 (L. Azancot, Los amores prohibidos 1980)
The feminine subject illuminates the sitting room (Direct object), i.e. makes it look
pretty using lights. This way, thanks to the metonymy CAUSE FOR EFFECT Â�(Peirsman
& Geeraerts 2006), the way the sitting room will look is expressed (adorned) by Â�naming
the cause (it having light). These examples corroborate the existence of the conceptual
metaphor LIGHT IS BEAUTY.
In the previous section, we already mentioned that – as has already been stated
in many works – the field of visual perception is naturally related to knowledge. Thus,
the Spanish ver has various epistemic uses (Fernández Jaén 2006; Hanegreefs 2008), by
which it becomes clear how essential sight is to get to know the world. The metaphor
COMPRENDER ES VER [to understand is to see] is, therefore, very frequent and
also explains why iluminar can have knowledge related content. In order to see, it is
necessary to have light and iluminar means TO MAKE SOMETHING HAVE LIGHT;
that way, metaphorically illuminating something makes it visible and, so, potentially
understandable. Such is the case of the following example:
	(9)â•…
Aquel triunfo que tanto pregonaba, no lo era para mí, seguramente porque el
Señor no da a todos el mismo entendimiento, pero mis luces aún alcanzaban
a iluminar el camino de su sinrazón [That triumph he boasted about was not
one for me, Â�
probably because the Lord does not bless us all with the same
understanding, but my lights were still able to illuminate the path of his
wrong] (J. Fernández Santos, Extramuros 1978)
In this example lights represent INTELLIGENCE12 and iluminar, the epistemic Â�content
of TO CLARIFY or TO TEACH. This type of examples, that are not frequent in the
corpus, illustrate an intellective process inspired by the notion of light; light is the
instrument to illuminate things and make them visible, and if they can be seen they
ïœ±ïœ².â•… In modern Spanish grammatical expressions like tener luces [to be bright] or ser una
lumbrera [to be a genius] are frequently used to indicate that someone is intelligent.Regarding
these kinds of structures, see the work of Sabban (1994).
ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ¶	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
can be understood. This way, his wrong (abstract object that needs to be understood)
can be explained using an intellectual process related to sight:
	ILLUMINATE →	SEE →	UNDERSTAND
The epistemic content of iluminar, however, is different to that expressed by ver [to
see], for instance. With ver knowledge is conceived as something instantaneous, resul-
tative, unequivocal, while with iluminar there is a more elaborate underlying process
that requires someone to have greater understanding. If we state, for example, that
María vio el problema [Mary saw the problem] we are saying that María understood
there was a problem and what it was about as soon a specific series of conditions were
fulfilled. On the contrary, María iluminó el problema [Mary illuminated the problem]
means that, after a process of careful thought, María was able to decipher the key to
the problem.
Lastly, our exploration of the data shows another very interesting constructional
variant: the use of iluminar as an unaccusative verb. As is well-known, an unaccu-
sative verb is an intransitive verb where the syntactic subject represents the inani-
mate entity that undergoes or in which the eventuality the verb denotes is expressed
Â�
(Mendikoetxea 1999). This conceptualization focuses on the idea of change of state
in the subject entity, and this change of state, in the case of iluminar, is produced due
to an event of internal cause, since there is no external agent to cause it: the change
occurs because an inherent property of the subject makes it do so. Let us look at the
following example:
	(10)â•…
El salón se iluminó. La exposición estaba a punto de inaugurarse [The room
was lit up. The exhibition was about to open]
 (J. P. Aparicio, Retratos de Ambigú 1989)
In (10), the subject the room changes from being dark to being lit up because the lights
it has are turned on following specific guidelines. Here, no agent can be Â�
voluntarily
seen to illuminate the room: it is illuminated thanks to a process that comes from the
room itself.13
This type of examples abounds in our corpus, due to their strong semantic moti-
vation. The prototypical meaning of iluminar represents the schema NON HUMAN
ïœ±ïœ³.â•… As pointed out by Mendikoetxea (1999) with unaccusative verbs of external cause, an
external strength or cause can be inferred through encyclopaedic knowledge of the world, but
that cause is not expressed linguistically, since what is relevant is that the process of change
begins and ends in the subject itself, due to one of its peculiarities. For example, in El rosal
floreció [The rose bush flowered] we could think that there was an entity that watered it, and
that it flowered for that reason. However, the process of flowering is intrinsic to the rose bush
and occurs of its own accord. Similarly, the room is lit up because it has lights that allow it to
do so, regardless of whether someone put them there.
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ·
SUBJECT PROJECTS LIGHT ON SOMETHING. Light is uncontrollable, is Â�
governed
byguidelinesunrelatedtoCandthismakesitpossibleforsubjectsthatrepresentÂ�entities
with a light of their own (street lamps, torches, etc.) to be included in an Â�
unaccusative
construction. This lexico-constructional variant is also often used Â�
metaphorically, as
we can see in the following examples:
	(11)â•…
El mendigo alzó la vista, y su rostro se iluminó de pronto con una sonrisa
de Â�bandera [The beggar lifted his gaze, and his face lit up suddenly with a
broad smile]  (C. Ruiz Zafón, La sombra del viento 2001)
	(12)â•…
Y a la criatura se le iluminaron los ojos [And the creatures eyes lit up]
 (J. Maqua, Invierno sin pretexto 1992)
Examples (11) and (12) show very frequent uses of iluminar, so frequent that they can
be considered to be partially grammaticalized. In these cases the syntactic Â�subjects that
are lit up following an internal process are linked to persons: his face and his eyes. These
parts of the body do not have light of their own, strictly speaking, but are Â�
culturally
related to abstract entities such as joy, life or personality, all very positive concepts.
The beggar’s face is illuminated metaphorically in (11) because he becomes happy,
and happiness is good, like LIGHT; therefore, once again it is the metaphor LIGHT
IS GOOD that allows this variation (iluminarse becomes TO BE HAPPY). Also, the
change from unhappiness to happiness comes from the subject itself and is carried out
within it. This is why the unaccusative structure is the most appropriate one for this
content.
Example (12) is similar although here the part of the face that lights up is
Â�
mentioned: the eyes. Also, in this sentence the Indirect object is expressed. It is
the PROTO-RECEIVER to whom the eyes belong (the creature, the boy, le). As we
Â�
mentioned earlier, already in Latin, lumen could metaphorically mean LIGHT FROM
THE EYES, and it is that semantic extension that reappears in this example. The eyes
represent the essence of the gaze and, therefore, the person’s state of mind. When an
individual is sad we say the eyes are apagados [turned off] (i.e. without light), but when
someone is happy his eyes light up. Thus, usually the eyes are focussed, due to their
symbolic character, when we want to determine someone’s state-of-mind: the eyes are
conceptualized as luminous elements that light up to indicate happiness or well-being
and turn off when unhappy. In Langackerian terms, they represent the Figure, and the
face, in its turn, acts as the Base or ground.
In short, the verb iluminar in Spanish is configured as a radial structure with a
prototypical core surrounded by different conceptualizations, instantiated by Â�
different
constructions, and peripheral semantic extensions generated from the prototype. This
prototype consists in the schematic image of NON HUMAN ENTITY Â�
PROJECTS
LIGHT ON ANOTHER ENTITY, and its greater prominence is motivated by
Â�
experiential patterns. It is unusual for an animated entity to control a light Â�
voluntarily,
ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ¸	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
since the light more often follows its own logic. In fact, even when we know through
our knowledge of the world that behind the luminous process there is or could be
an agent, we tend to express the perception of that fact eliminating the agent and
Â�
focussing on the luminous entity which, thanks to conceptual metaphors, can cause
iluminar to slide towards cognitive fields related to beauty or knowledge. Next, we will
go on to analyze the verb alumbrar in order to find out if it follows the same conceptual
design as iluminar.
3.2â•… Alumbrar
The verb alumbrar, just like iluminar, stems from the Latin verb illumināre. Now, what
implications does this fact entail? Do both verbs behave in the same way? When a word
evolves diachronically and generates two different words, as in this case, Â�
normally
either one of them disappears (following the principle of linguistic economy that tends
to cancel total synonymy between terms) or both words coexist, each developing their
own semantic nuances. In the case of alumbrar our analysis reveals two facts: firstly,
this verb does not present such active polysemy in modern Spanish as we might infer
from the lexicographical information14, and the second is that, despite agreeing with
iluminar in many aspects, alumbrar has managed to develop its own very functional
values, as we will see below.
We should probably start by mentioning that the semantic prototype of alumbrar
is the same as that of iluminar, i.e. the conceptualization NON HUMAN SUBJECT
PROJECTS LIGHT ON SOMETHING. The data obtained clearly show its extremely
high frequency of use, as with iluminar. Let us look at an example:
	(13)â•…
La noche fue igualmente larga e igualmente tensa bajo una luna que aún
Â�
alumbraba con fuerza la llanura [The night was equally long and equally
tense beneath a moon that powerfully lit up the plane] 
 (A. Vázquez-Figueroa, Tuareg 1981)
This example shows a use of alumbrar that completely coincides with the prototypical
use of iluminar: an inanimate entity which has a light of its own (the moon) projects
light upon another entity which acts as a Direct object (the plane) following a Â�
natural
pattern (viz. day cycles). The speaker does not intervene in the process and, for that
reason, the moon is conceptualized as the syntactic subject. As we can see, iluminar
and alumbrar share the same semantic prototype, due both to their shared origin
and to the underlying experiential motivation. Of course, this meaning is also used
Â�metaphorically with alumbrar:
ïœ±ïœ´.â•… For example, we have not found any examples of alumbrar with the meaning of TO
DISCOVER SOMETHING UNDER GROUND or TO GET DRUNK, in spite of these values
being registered in various modern Spanish dictionaries.
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¸ïœ¹
	 (14)â•…
Tras los gruesos cristales adivinaron los cofrades una chispa de codicia como
la que alumbra al cazador furtivo ante la presa [Behind the thick glass the
Â�
members of the brotherhood discovered a spark of greed like that which
lights up an illegal hunter before his prey] 
 (L. M. Díez Rodríguez, La fuente de la edad 1986)
Inthiscase,thesyntacticsubjectthesparkofgreedisofametaphoricalnature.Thewriter
resorts to this metaphor in order to describe the mental process a hunter Â�
experiences
after detecting his prey. The sense of triumph he experiences at that moment is only
made possible because of the light that shines when the prey passes by and, therefore,
allows him to get a better shot. The information we get from the real-time experience
is projected onto an abstract, metaphorical level and allows us to interpret greed as a
light that, when it sheds at the right time, can help to achieve a goal.
The same occurs with the rest of the constructional variants related to the emis-
sion of light. Alumbrar only sporadically occurs with a HUMAN SUBJECT (neither in
a physical nor in a metaphorical sense), and its co-appearance with an Indirect object
seems even more strange. Below are some of the few examples we found in the corpus:
	(15)â•…
Con un quinqué alumbraba la escalera primero y el pasillo después [With an
oil lamp he lit up first the stairs, then the hallway] 
 (E. Mendoza, Laverdad sobre el caso Savolta 1975)
	(16)â•…
Pudiera ahora alumbrar tantos instantes de tu vida [If I could now light up
so many moments in your life] (F. Umbral, Mortal y rosa 1975)
	(17)â•…
[…] las luces del vestíbulo le alumbraban la cara […the lights in the foyer
shone on his face] (A. Muñoz Molina, El invierno enLisboa 1987)
In example (15), a human subject lights up two entities (the stairs and the hallway)
that act as Direct objects. Just like in the contexts of iluminar, here too the object with
which the subject carries out the action (the oil lamp) is made explicit in the form of an
Instrumental complement, and an intention or goal can be inferred, since the subject
shines light on those areas of the room for a reason.
Example (16) belongs to the novel written by F. Umbral, Mortal y rosa, where the
writerreflectsonthedeathofhisson.Inthiscase,theauthorusesalumbrarÂ�metaphorically
to refer to certain moments in his son’s life that he can now remember and recreate
Â�
lyrically since he is able to alumbrar them: by giving them light, those moments become
visible again in an abstract dimension, which makes them present once again.
In example (17), again we have a sentence with a NON HUMAN SUBJECT and
an Indirect object where the beneficiary or PROTO-PATIENT is the possessor of
the Direct object (his face). Here, the lights light up the face in a fortuitous manner
Â�
(unintentional), and C considers it necessary to specify who the face belongs to using
the clitic le (to him).
ïœ³ïœ¹ïœ°	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
Up to this point, alumbrar and iluminar behave in exactly the same way. Both share
the same prototypical core meaning which makes them practically Â�
interchangeable
in the contexts that require this basic meaning. In addition, the lexico-constructional
Â�
variations of this basic schema are similar in design and have little productivity. As
regards the extensions and modulations that stem from this core meaning, we will show
that, in spite of some coincidences, alumbrar has developed its own values that do not
appear in iluminar, which leads to a complementary distribution between the two verbs.
Firstly, alumbrar is very often used as a copulative verb of state, meaning TO HAVE
THE ABILITY TO PROJECT LIGHT; and this usage, we at least, have not managed
to document with iluminar. In example (18), for instance, alumbrar Â�conceptualizes the
potential ability of a NON HUMAN SUBJECT to shed light, which is why alumbrar
with this meaning has an intransitive behavior.
	 (18)â•…
El viajero todavía no ha salido de La Mata y la linterna ya ha dejado de
Â�alumbrar [The traveller has not yet left La Mata and already the lantern has
stopped Â�
shining] (J. Llamazares, El río del olvido 1990)
As we can see, in this example the subject the lantern no longer works because its
property of shedding light has disappeared. In this case, it is irrelevant whether the
traveller intends to illuminate something (perhaps a path). The verb merely expresses
the eventual annulment of the property inherent to the torch of shedding light.15 We
can therefore conclude that alumbrar, as opposed to iluminar, often functions as a
state verb.
One of the semantic extensions that alumbrar shares with iluminar is the one
where the verb slides into the domain of cognition. So, we can find epistemic uses of
alumbrar where it means TO CLARIFY or EXPLAIN. The reason for this projection is
the same one that operates in the process with iluminar: the cognitive importance of
vision (and of light for vision to work) in order to get to know the world. Let us take a
look at an example:
	(19)â•…
- Y la sobrina de nuestro primer socialista del barrio de Salamanca -añadió
Marta dándole la espalda, como desentendiéndose de lo que había contribuido
a Â�alumbrar [And the niece of our first socialist in the neighbourhood of
Â�
Salamanca – added Marta turning her back on him, as if to wash her hands
of what she had Â�
contributed to enlighten] (M. Longares, Romanticismo 2001)
As we can see in this example, Marta gives some kind of explanation that has a decisive
result in clarifying the details of some murky political affair, the verb Â�
alumbrar being
ïœ±ïœµ.â•… Therefore, examples such as Esta linterna alumbra perfectamente [this torch shines
Â�
perfectly] would have a clearly copulative value since it expresses the notion of it working
correctly or, even, that it is an excellent torch.
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¹ïœ±
responsible for expressing that clarification. As occurs with Â�
iluminar, the Â�
epistemic
value that alumbrar lexicalizes has as a semantic framework a previous, more complex
situation, in which an elaborate intellectual process has been Â�
necessary to reach the
correct understanding of the event. In this example, that process is expressed in the
conversation between the participants, where Marta’s intervention is simply the final
link that allows the fact to be alumbrado (for it to metaphorically have light) and,
therefore, to be understood.
In spite of coinciding with iluminar in this semantic modulation related to
Â�knowledge, alumbrar has its own semantic domains linked to a very peculiar
Â�
conceptual metaphor which we suggest defining as LIGHT IS THE ORIGIN. Our
cultural knowledge and the above-mentioned influence that LIGHT has in our way
of meta-representing reality make the idea of LIGHT become naturally linked to the
origin of things. Light means life and existence, because without it we cannot see and
do not know of the existence of many things we perceive visually. Even the anthro-
pological imaginary on birth is based on the idea that a baby passes from darkness
to light as soon as it is born, which is why in Spanish alumbrar (schematically TO
PROJECT LIGHT) has developed the meaning of DAR A LUZ (literally, ‘to bring to
light’) or PARIR [both meaning TO GIVE BIRTH]. This is a very common and highly
grammaticalized meaning in the corpus, as we can see below:
	(20)â•…
Si las cuitadas llegaban a alumbrar un vástago rubio […][If the miserable
were able to give birth to a blond child] (P. Faner, Flor de sal 1986)
	(21)â•…[…]recogetodassusfuerzasparaalumbrarunaprogeniequeleenseñeahablar
[…gathersallherstrengthtogivebirthtooffspringthatwillteachhertospeak]
 (J. Benet Gotilla, Saúl ante Samuel 1980)
In these two examples, the direct objectsblond child and offspring represent the Â�children
to which some mothers are going to give birth (dar a luz), a process expressed by the
verb alumbrar. To alumbrar a baby means to make it have light, i.e. for its Â�
existence to
be evident and unquestionable. But the possibilities of the Â�
metaphor LIGHT IS THE
ORIGIN are not limited to the meaning of giving birth. On other occasions, alumbrar
slides towards a more abstract conceptual field where the Â�
conceptualization is not of
making something that already existed visible (to make a baby be born), but of the
very process of creation, of producing something that did not exist before. Thanks to
this metaphor, alumbrar has also developed the meaning of ENGENDERING, as can
be seen in the example:
	 (22)â•…
[…] es la sistemática repetición del juego lo que en el cerebro de Juan termina
por alumbrar la sospecha de que ambos sincronizan […it is the systematic
repetition of the game that ends up breeding in Juan’s mind the suspicion
that they are both in synch] (M. Longares, La novela del corsé 1979)
ïœ³ïœ¹ïœ²	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
In this example, the suspicion of the game being fixed is created (literally alumbrada)
in Juan’s mind thanks to its mechanical repetition; at first everything works as it should,
but the recurring repetitions prove that something is wrong, so in the mind of the
observer a suspicion is bred that was not there before. Well, the origin of this suspicion
is expressed in the verb alumbrar: it indicates that until the light of intelligence makes
the suspicion visible, it does not exist. Here, alumbrar expresses a value of origin, as
it does when it means TO GIVE BIRTH, but also of creation16, which confirms the
existence of the metaphor LIGHT IS THE ORIGIN.
Our analysis of the verb alumbrar proves that this verb shares its semantic pro-
totype with iluminar. Together they cover the semantic domain of light projection,
where – more often than not – the subject is NON HUMAN (a source of light),
although there are other less frequent lexico-constructional possibilities. The two
verbs also share their extension towards the domain of knowledge but, beyond their
similarities, the radial structure of each verb is orientated towards some specific
uses. So, Â�
alumbrar is normally used as a state verb to indicate the luminous potential
that prototypical subjects possess (torches, lamps, etc.), whilst it also has semantic
Â�
projections that can express content related to the origin of things, like TO GIVE
BIRTH or to Â�
ENGENDER; these last two being values that iluminar does not have.
3.3â•… Deslumbrar
The verb deslumbrar is a denominal formation created from the conflation of the Â�prefix
des- and the noun lumbre. The prefix des- comes from the Latin prefix dĭs-, which in
Latin had two meanings, NEGATION and INTENSITY (Alvar & Pottier 1993), the
latter being the one to prevail in deslumbrar. This way, the verb lexicalizes the sensitive
conscience that some lights can be very bright, so bright that they can blind some-
one. From this basic image comes an extremely interesting notion of LIGHT: the idea
that LIGHT IS STRENGTH or POWER. Indeed, the central idea that makes for the
Â�
different constructional possibilities of deslumbrar is that LIGHT can constitute a very
intense entity, to such an extent that it can alter the state of another entity that perceives
it. This basic content constitutes the prototypical meaning of deslumbrar: a luminous
object projects upon an animated entity a ray of light so strong it Â�
momentarily leaves
that entity without sight, as represented in Figure 517:
ïœ±ïœ¶.â•… This cognitive motivation also explains the grammaticalization of Spanish structures like
encendérsele a alguien una luz/una bombilla [to turn on someone’s light/light bulb (i.e. to have
an idea or realize)] or tener una idea luminosa [to have a bright idea]. These expressions are
linked to the emergence of ideas or intuitions in the mind.
ïœ±ïœ·.â•… The symbol (≈) that goes with the affected entity refers to the physical alteration it
Â�
undergoes in the process denoted by the verb.

ï¿¼
c
Figure 5.â•‡ Prototypical conceptualization of deslumbrar
As we will see, the basic meaning of the verb deslumbrar is highly influenced by the
semantic content of its morphological components. Deslumbrar can have a HUMAN
subject and also a HUMAN Direct object. This way, a person projects light on another
person such that the latter undergoes a transitory alteration in its visual capacity. Let
us look at the following example:
(23)â•…
Ambrosio, el patrón, a veces le deslumbraba con los focos y se reía [Ambrosio, the
landlord, would sometimes dazzle him with the lights and laugh]
 (J. M. Â�
Gironella, Los hombres lloran solos 1987)
Here, the subject Ambrosio projects a very strong light upon another individual
Â�
(represented by the clitic le) such that he gets dazzled by them. It is interesting to see
that the Direct object of deslumbrar acts, in these cases, as a true PROTO-PATIENT,
since its integrity is altered in a physical sense by the action expressed by the verb.
In this construction it is also frequent, as we can see in (23), for the Instrumental
Â�complement (with the lights) to be made explicit, since HUMAN subjects, as with
Â�
iluminar and alumbrar, normally lack a light of their own (iconicity).
With deslumbrar it is also possible to have a NON HUMAN subject, again,
Â�
corresponding with the entity that sheds light. In these cases, C states that, unintend-
edly, a certain element, at a given moment, blinds a HUMAN Direct object with its
brightness, as in (24).
	(24)â•…
[…] y al llegar a la calle lo deslumbra la claridad todavía veraniega del sol
[…][… and when he arrived on the street the sun’s still summery brightness
dazzled him…] (A. Muñoz Molina, Sefarad. Una novela de novelas 2001)
Here, the brightness of the sun is the subject that dazzles a man (Direct object lo)
who goes out on the street. There is no underlying intention, no agentivity: all that is
expressed is the strength of that brightness and its ability to blind someone. This same
conceptualization can be used on an abstract, metaphorical level, as in example (25):
	(25)â•…
[…] igual que la luz es más veloz que el sonido, la conciencia es más rápida
que el dolor, y nos deslumbra como un relámpago que sucede en silencio
[… just as light is quicker than sound, conscience is faster than pain and
Â�
dazzles us like a lightning bolt striking in silence]
 (A. Muñoz Molina, El invierno en Lisboa 1998)
ïœ³ïœ¹ïœ´	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
In this example, the syntactic subject is an abstract entity, conscience. Our Â�knowledge of
the world allows us to metaphorically separate the properties of a Â�
powerful Â�
luminous
object and add it to a theoretical entity such as the human Â�conscience, so that the influ-
ence of the latter in people’s behavior is interpreted in terms of a Â�powerful light (that of
a lightning bolt, in the example provided). So, in the same way a very strong light can
blind a person, their conscience can also drastically change someone’s thoughts, up to
changing them for the better. Furthermore, by Â�
relating the abstract Â�
element to light it
also receives a positive connotation thanks to the metaphor LIGHT IS GOOD: if light
is good, certain intense lights (as in the metaphor of conscience) will be even more so,
and will represent positive notions.
The experiential schema mentioned has been projected in the case of the verb
deslumbrar towards a metaphorical domain, keeping its structure intact, which has
allowed the verb to lexicalize a very important meaning within its semantic network:
we are referring to the meaning of IMPRESSING. A luminous entity can be so intense
that a receiving entity can be altered by it, and, on a figurative level, a HUMAN entity
can have such an interesting or surprising property that it can generate a new state of
conscience in its receivers. On this abstract level, the idea of physical modification gets
lost18, the act of deslumbrar merely produces a new cognitive state, a change in the
appreciation that the HUMAN Direct object has of the Subject19. Normally, this meta-
phorical meaning is used in contexts where the subject draws attention to a positive or
unusual quality of himself. Let us look at some examples:
	(26)â•…
Que, no obstante su natural sencillez, cuando el protocolo de la Corte lo
Â�
aconsejaba, sabía deslumbrar a nobles y plebeyos luciendo los más suntuosos
trajes y las joyas más valiosas [Who, in spite of her natural simplicity, when
the protocol of the Court advised it, knew how to dazzle noblemen and
Â�
plebeians with the most Â�
magnificent outfits and the most valuable jewels]
 (F. Vizcaíno Casas, Isabel, camisa vieja 1992)
	(27)â•…
Con aquellas frases que le habían repartido no iba a poder deslumbrar a los
del cine, ni exhibir sus dotes de actor, que no eran pocas […][With those lines
ïœ±ïœ¸.â•… Nevertheless, it is interesting to point out that the noun impresión comes from the
Latin impressio, which means, among other things, MARK, CLASH OF AN ENEMY or
ATTACK. Therefore, even impresión or the verb derived from it impresionar diachronically
stem from a noun that expressed a physical alteration that was grammaticalized in its
Â�
development towards Spanish. Therefore, it is not at all surprising that deslumbrar has been
able to generate the content of IMPRESIONAR (to impress) from a prototype linked to
physical alteration.
ïœ±ïœ¹.â•… For an interesting reflection on the cognitive relation between perception and mental
states, see Croft (1993).
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¹ïœµ
they had offered him he would not be able to dazzle men of cinema, nor
exhibit his skills as an actor, which were not few]
 (F. Fernán Gómez, El viaje aninguna parte 1995)
In examples (26) and (27), the (elided) syntactic subjects leave a great Â�
impression
on some individuals (noblemen and plebeians and men of cinema) that act as
Â�
PROTO-PATIENTS, whose evaluation of the subjects changes after meeting them.
Nevertheless, the reason why those subjects impress them is different in each case. In
(26) the feminine subject manages to dazzle her audience by wearing beautiful outfits
and jewellery; elements that reinforce her external image and, in a given context, will
in themselves cause a transformation effect. In (27), however, the attribute or quality
that allows the subject to impress its observers is more abstract, since it is related to
its talent in dramatic acting. If in the previous example some jewels were enough to
dazzle those present at the party, in this example dramatical prose is necessary to show
the actor’s talent and for it to be perceived and evaluated.
Sometimes, C can consider the presence of the Direct object irrelevant. When this
happens the verb continues to mean IMPRESS, but the scene is conceptualized in a
different way, as we can observe in the following example:
	(28)â•…
Los exámenes se aproximaban y Edmundo los preparó a conciencia.
Â�
Necesitaba deslumbrar para que le fuera perdonado su error con el hombre
del jersey azul [The exams were drawing near and Edmund prepared them
conscientiously. He needed to dazzle them in order for his mistake with the
man in the blue jumper to be forgiven] (B. Gopegui, Lo real 2001)
In this example, there is no HUMAN Direct object put on scene, but it necessarily
exists (the action of IMPRESSING can only be fulfilled in the receiver), and is found
on a secondary level, in the background of the conceptual framework. That way, the
desire for the subject to stand out, to be the best in his exams is highlighted and given
conceptual prominence.
As is evident, deslumbrar is a causative verb: it represents a verbal Â�
predication
from which a flow of energy emanates, causing an external element to change.
What is interesting to see is that with the meaning of TO IMPRESS we find various
Â�
passive examples with the structure dejarse + deslumbrar [to let oneself be dazzled]
which conceptualize the conscious wish (or at least predisposition) of the PROTO-
PATIENT – which acts in these cases as a syntactic subject – to change and become
impressed. These are extremely interesting structures where the PROTO-PATIENT
adopts a partially active attitude, as if it were naturally inclined to receive that impres-
sion. That is why, in this case, the verb dejar [to let] appears and, as we mentioned
earlier, metaphorically expresses causative PERMISSION, eliminating any barriers
ïœ³ïœ¹ïœ¶	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
preventing the event from developing: the subject wants to be impressed and this
wish is liberated. Let us look at the example:
	(29)â•…
Si entras en Roma ostentando como un triunfo la victoria sobre los partos,
el pueblo se dejará deslumbrar por tu aureola [If you enter Rome bearing
the victory over the Parthians, the people will be dazzled by your aura]
 (T. Moix, No digas que fue un sueño 1993)
The subject the people represents a huge mass of people who are susceptible to being
dazzled by their hero. This lack of resistance from the people favours the use of a
Â�
passive construction, with a PATIENT as a subject that exerts no counterforce against
change, and an AGENT in the form of a complement (by your aura) which expresses
the beauty and authority that the people long for. Nevertheless, when the subject offers
resistance in order to prevent the stimulus from impressing it until it changes its mind
or mental state, the passive construction with dejarse is negated, as in (30).

los tres y no se dejaba deslumbrar tan fácilmente [Pepe called them to the
sitting room, where he was in charge with his gun. He controlled the three
of them and was not so easily impressed]
 (J. L. Martín Vigil, En defensa propia 1985)
The syntactic subject is very much aware of the fact that the three individuals with him
could steal his position. This conviction comes from the specific facts surrounding
the contextual situation (perhaps the other three are physically stronger), facts that
could impress him in given circumstances. However, the subject resists and blocks that
potential change of state in his behavior.
Lastly, deslumbrar, in the same way as alumbrar, can express an intransitive state
with NON HUMAN SUBJECTS, i.e. the ability of a source of light to shed an extremely
intense blinding light. Here is an example:
	(31)â•…
Al fondo, la caja fuerte abierta, donde titila una montañita de brillantes, el
fulgor que deslumbra [At the end, the open safe, where a small mountain of
gems sparkle, with a dazzling glow]
 (J. Ribera, La sangre de mi hermano 1988)
In this case, what is stated is that the subject the glow has an intense shine that can
dazzle. It is a copulative structure which merely represents an inherent property or
attribute of the source of light.
The verb deslumbrar does not present as many lexico-constructional variants as
iluminar or alumbrar, nor has it developed many abstract meanings, but even so, it is

a very interesting verb because it codifies multiple variations related to the Â�
metaphor
LIGHT IS STRENGTH. As we have proven, the knowledge that speakers have of
light is not only related to its potential to allow vision, and all that this implies, or to
its uncontrollable nature, but is also linked to facts such as there being very intense
sources of light. From this sensory knowledge comes the schematic structure on which
the different conceptualizations of deslumbrar rest.
3.4â•… Vislumbrar
Vislumbrar is a compound formed through the conflation of the Latin negation adverb
uix, which meant BARELY or WITH DIFFICULTY and the verb illumināre, already
mentioned above (Corominas & Pascual 1980–1991). We will see that the prototypical
meaning of vislumbrar is strongly influenced by the semantics imposed by its constitu-
ents. As occurs with deslumbrar, vislumbrar lexicalizes the DIFFICULTY OF VISION,
since the adverb uix provides the nuance that there is not enough LIGHT to see clearly.
The verb vislumbrar is essentially a verb of visual perception, since its seman-
tic frame is characterized by two fundamental elements, viz. a PERCEIVER, on the
one hand – who perceives through sight –, and a PERCEPT (the perceived visual
Â�stimulus), on the other. Of the wide spectrum of lexico-constructional possibilities this
basic schema of visual perception has in Spanish20, vislumbrar has specialized in the
Â�
conceptualization of the difficulty for the PERCEPT to be seen: either due to Â�
obstacles
that complicate vision, or to the very own nature of the PERCEPT (its fleetingness,
intermittence, transparency, etc.). For all these reasons, vislumbrar corresponds to the
schema PERCEIVER (normally human) plus PHYSICAL PERCEPT (a visible entity)
in a contextual framework of difficulty of sight, as we represent in the following sche-
matic idealization21:

Let us look at some examples:
	(32)â•…

 (F. J. Satué, Lacarne 1991)
	(33)â•…Vislumbróelvuelofugazdeunpájaro[Heglimpsedthefleetingflightofabird]
(F. Hernández, La certeza 1989).
	(34)â•…
Se acercó y a través de las hojas ligeramente oscilantes vislumbró la hendi-
dura en la roca [He moved closer and through the lightly swaying leaves he
discerned the crack in the rock] (F. Hernández, Naturaleza 1989)
	(35)â•…
Desde este sitio -continuó- puedo vislumbrar el firmamento sin alzar la vista
[From this place – he went on – I can make out the stars without looking up]
 (F. Â�Hernández, Naturaleza 1989)
In all of these examples, contextual elements indicate that the surroundings or the
essence of the PERCEPT make seeing it more or less difficult for the PERCEIVER.
In example (32) the PERCEPT (the shadows) is, due both to its intangible nature and
to the pragmatic context, difficult to perceive. Therefore, C uses the verbal periphra-
sis alcanzar a [to reach] + infinitive (vislumbrar being the auxiliary verb) to indicate
that only after a voluntary effort, given the contextual difficulties, the PERCEIVER
is able to see the shadows. In (33) the adjective fleeting denotes that the PERCEPT is
ephemeral and, therefore, difficult to be visually perceived. In example (34), in turn,
the Â�
PERCEIVER is only able to see the PERCEPT (the crack in the rock) after Â�
moving
closer to it, covering the distance that separates them. Here again the Â�
perception is
affected by the existence of a physical barrier between the two: lightly swaying leaves.
Therefore, both due to the distance and to the leaves that hinder the perception,
C chooses to use vislumbrar instead of another verb like ver or observar [to see, to
observe]. Lastly, in (35), perception is a little more feasible than in the other cases,
and the circumstantial complement without looking up even seems to indicate that the
PERCEIVER adopts a passive attitude. Nevertheless, the constituent from this place
indicates that there is a considerable distance which, in other circumstances, could
hamper visual perception of the stars. This way, as opposed to the other examples, in
(35), the (possible) obstacles of vision are only mentioned as non-profiled secondary
elements, as part of the conceptual background.
As is often the case with verbs related to light and vision, the prototypical mean-
ing of vislumbrar can be projected on a more abstract level to the domain of knowl-
edge. Vislumbrar can, indeed, express epistemic content, though conserving part of
its modal content, viz. the idea of fleetingness or imprecision. By using vislumbrar in
these epistemic contexts, the knowledge the PERCEIVER gains is understood to be
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ³ïœ¹ïœ¹
incipient or incomplete: obtaining knowledge requires overcoming a series of previous
obstacles. Let us look at two examples:
	 (36)â•…
Escrutó el semblante de la mujer vislumbrando en el fruncimiento de las cejas
Â�pintadas un punto de malicia [He studied the woman’s face glimpsing in the
frowning, painted eyebrows a touch of malice] (F. J. Satué, La carne 1991)
	 (37)â•…Entreloshorroresdenuestrotiempo,LamodeEspinosavislumbraeltriunfodel
orden liberal democrático-universal [Through the horrors of our time, Lamo
deEspinosaglimpsedthetriumphoftheliberaldemocratic-universalorder]
 (J. Benet Goitia, Saúl ante Samuel 1980)
In example (36), an elided first-person PERCEIVER manages to observe or infer an
abstract PERCEPT (a touch of malice). The intuition of the woman’s malice is only
achieved after an intense effort, represented in the scene by the verb escrutar [to
Â�
scrutinize], which indicates visual perception through a long process of concentra-
tion in order to discover a hidden truth22: the PERCEIVER observes the woman’s face
for a long time, and only after doing so does he reaches the epistemic goal (viz., to
determine that she is malicious). The knowledge expressed in (37) is more contingent
than that in (36). In this case the PERCEIVER Lamo de Espinosa observes a PERCEPT
related to political information, the triumph of the liberal democratic-universal order.
The difficulty in reaching this stage of knowledge is due, in this case, to the inherent
subjectivity that characterizes the world of public life. The Idealized Cognitive Model
(ICM) of politics includes disagreement – or individual point of view – as a default
characteristic, and so, the use of vislumbrar indicates that the conclusion the subject
draws thanks to observing facts cannot be understood in absolute terms, but as a mere
personal appreciation.
The verb vislumbrar can also denote evaluative perception (Hanegreefs 2008).
Evaluative perception occurs when the verb does not strictly express the true vision
of a phenomenon of the world, where a judgement is given on a reality23, but, instead,
ïœ²ïœ².â•… For an in-depth analysis of the properties of the verb escrutar and its differences with
escudriñar, see the work of Delbecque and Hanegreefs (2006).
ïœ²ïœ³.â•… It is necessary to distinguish cognitive perception from evaluative perception. The
former, represented mainly by cases in which the visual perception verb is complemented
by a completive sentence, indicates comprehension or awareness of a fact or event, through
direct perception of reality. For example, in the sentence I see you have bought a new car
the PERCEIVER sees a specific occurrence (his neighbour in a different vehicle than usual,
etc.) and, following a basic reasoning based on the logic that governs the world, states his
Â�
cognitive comprehension of that fact using the verb to see. However, evaluative perception is
more abstract and subjective; in it, it is not necessary for the PERCEIVER to follow logical
ïœ´ïœ°ïœ°	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
behaves as a verb of propositional attitude, like considerar [to consider], juzgar [to judge]
or opinar [to think]. The syntactic structure with evaluative perception can vary, since
it is the context that usually indicates when we have to do with a subjective Â�
statement,
and, thus, not pure physical perception. Even so, there are constructions that are more
likely to receive an evaluative reading. One of these structures responds to the formula
PERCEIVER (human) + PERCEPT (specific or abstract) + ATTRIBUTE:
	 (38)â•…
En efecto, La conexión Bellarrosa incluye, apenas si esbozada, materia
Â�
argumental como para una novela extensa que vislumbramos fascinante
[Indeed, La conexión de Bellarrosa includes, though barely outlined,
Â�sufficient material for an extensive novel which we foresee to be Â�fascinating]
(ABC Cultural 20/12/1991)
	(39)â•…
No quiso pensar en el cansancio. Podía vislumbrar la sensación como una
Â�
amenaza expresada mediante una fórmula críptica [He did not want to
think about Â�tiredness. He could foresee the sensation like a threat expressed
using a cryptic formula] (F. J. Satué, La carne 1991)
In example (38) the literary critic concludes his reflection with a final observation on
a novel that could be written. This novel does not yet exist, but the critic subjectively
imagines that, if it did exist, it would be fascinating. The adjective fascinating, which
acts as a Predicative complement oriented towards the Direct object extensive novel,
unequivocally codifies the particular point of view of the subject (the critic) regarding
that novel. So, the PERCEPT is not a visible object but simply a meta-phenomenon
created and evaluated in the imagination of the PERCEIVER. The result of this subjec-
tive evaluation or appreciation is expressed by means of a Predicative complement.
In addition, we see that vislumbrar maintains its semantic nuance of DIFICULTY OF
VISION, since it is more difficult to evaluate an object that does not exist (the extensive
novel) than a tangible one.
Example (39) is very similar. There we have a subject that judges the feeling
Â�(sensation) of being tired (tiredness), using vislumbrar. In this case, a comparative
Â�
construction introduced by the modal nexus like (like a threat expressed using a Â�
cryptic
formula) specifies how the PERCEIVER experiences the PERCEPT. By comparing
tiredness to a purely metaphorical entity (the threat), vislumbrar is reduced to a
cognitive process of evaluation, in which sight does not take part.
rules of reality and, in fact, it is not even essential for its statement to be based on visible
circumstances. Evaluative perception is purely individual and axiological, and therefore the
scene normally includes attributive phrases that express the evaluation the subject performs.
For a detailed analysis of these structures, see the works of Rodríguez Espiñeira (2000) and
Hanegreefs (2008).
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ´ïœ°ïœ±
Lastly, vislumbrar also appears in copulative structures (cf. supra) where the
PERCEPT functions as syntactic subject. This way, C highlights the presence of the
stimulus that can be vislumbrado (glimpsed) and gives it a greater Â�
prominence on
the scene. The data show that in these structures vislumbrar tends to have a
Â�
metaphorical or epistemic meaning, which is extremely interesting. In contrast
to ver [to see] – the most general and neutral verb of perception in Spanish –
the Â�
copulative Â�
construction with vislumbrar is not related to pure physical visual
Â�
perception; instead, it serves more elaborate discourse purposes, in which the aim is
to draw attention to a (more or less) notional entity that emerges from the scene at a
given moment, as we can see below:
	(40)â•…
La televisión seguía sin llegar a todos los hogares y, aunque el color ya se
empezaba a vislumbrar, la mayoría aún seguía inmersa en el blanco y el
negro [Television still had not reached all households and, although colour
could already be glimpsed, most remained immersed in black and white]
(El Norte deCastilla, 15/06/2002)
	(41)â•…
Tras once años, ya comienzan a vislumbrarse los frutos de tan ardua labor

(ABCCultural, 12/07/1996)
	(42)â•…
Y lo peor es que no se vislumbra una solución de estabilidad [And the worst
thing is that there is still no sign of a stable solution] (El Mundo 19/02/1994)
It has come to our attention that this lexico-constructional variant of vislumbrar mostly
appears in newspaper articles, a genre related to the present day, to current affairs24. In
this context, vislumbrar offers an excellent conceptual frame to explain the more or less
sudden arrival of a new entity. Thus, the syntactic subjects colour, the fruits of such an
arduous job and a stable solution are typically entities that occur or appear after certain
conditions have been fulfilled: for instance, after years of saving up to buy a colour
television, in (40), after working hard, in (41), and after reaching political agreements,
in (42). Again, vision and light are related to CREATION. Physical vision of an object
within the framework of vislumbrar would go through three phases:
	 LACK OF VISION →	 INTERMITTENT VISION →	 TOTAL VISION
Similarly, on an abstract level, at the beginning of the pragmatic process, an
Â�
agreement or something strange (at a given moment in history) such as colour
Â�
televisions, would not be seen at all (they did not yet exist); after a second process
of political debates or family saving, they would begin to come about gradually; and,
ïœ²ïœ´.â•… In fact, as we can see in Table 1, 44 of the 104 occurrences documented for vislumbrar
come from press articles, which corresponds to 45.76% of the total corpus.
ïœ´ïœ°ïœ²	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
lastly, if the process is successful, the entity could be seen completely (it now exists).
Now, a copulative conceptualization of this pragmatic process would focus on the last
phases of the development with the emerging element as syntactic subject. The sole
use of Â�
vislumbrar, in this configuration, would suffice to recall the whole conceptual
Â�
framework (viz. the three phases mentioned above) in the mind of the speaker, and to
complete the semantic cohesion of the text.
In conclusion, the analysis of vislumbrar allows us to corroborate the
Â�
transcendental character of LIGHT as a cognitive category within human thought. If
there is light, there is knowledge, etc. If light is sporadic (or lacking), as lexicalized in
vislumbrar, sight suffers and, therefore, all the meanings derived from the prototype
materialize this visual difficulty. Even so, as we have seen, this verb is hugely produc-
tive in Â�newspaper articles or texts on political criticism, since its peculiar configuration
allows it to express the reaching of agreements or the arrival of news in an effective way
on this level of discourse.
3.5â•… Columbrar
The last of our five verbs has the most problematic etymology. The most widespread
theory states that columbrar comes from a hypothetical Latin form *culmbrar, possibly
through phonetic modification reinforced by the presence of vislumbrar. This hypo-
thetical form, in turn, derives from culmen, which in Latin means PEAK or HEIGHT
(Corominas & Pascual 1980–1991). The meaning of this verb, according to this origin,
would be TO SEE FROM FAR AWAY, and the only thing we know for certain, that
is proven by the data, is that columbrar in modern Spanish prototypically means TO
SEE or TO DISCOVER. It is, therefore, a verb of visual perception which expresses
either a vision perceived without difficulty after covering a certain distance towards the
PERCEPT, or the epistemic notion of discovery when seeing an entity by chance. For
the conceptual development of both meanings the idea of DISTANCE (but not as an
INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLE) between PERCEIVER and PERCEPT is decisive.
The mental image that columbrar activates can be represented as follows25:
ï¿¼ c
Figure 7.â•‡ Prototypical conceptualization of columbrar
ïœ²ïœµ.â•… In this case the arrows of opposite orientation indicate both the direction of the
Â�
PERCEIVER’s motion and the distance separating it from the PERCEPT.
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ´ïœ°ïœ³
Let us look at some examples:
	(43)â•…
Y una vez que sus pupilas columbraron los nombres en la lista, deletreó en
voz baja, ansiosamente, los incluidos en la letra C…[And once his pupils had
discerned the names on the list, he anxiously spelled out in a whisper those
included under the letter C…] (M. Delibes, Madera de héroe 1987)
	(44)â•…
[…] cuando alcancen la cima lo columbrarán en lontananza […when they
reach the top they will discern it in the distance]
(La Vanguardia, 27/02/1994)
	(45)â•…
Y algo más iba a añadir cuando la columbraron por detrás de unas
chumberas en compañía de una vieja bruja [And she was going to add
something else when they discovered her behind some prickly pear cacti
in the company of an old witch]
 (J. M. Caballero Bonald, Toda la noche oyeron pasarpájaros 1981)
	(46)â•…
Abrió don Fermín el ojo menos castigado por la solera y columbró lo que
parecía ser una visión provocada por el exceso de solera […][Fermín opened
the eye that was least punished by the sun and discerned what appeared to
be a vision caused by the excess of sunshine…]
 (J. M. Caballero Bonald, Toda lanoche oyeron pasar pájaros 1981)
In all these examples the visual action is resultative, i.e. it occurs automatically as soon
as the PERCEIVER sees the PERCEPT. Nevertheless, contextual elements Â�
suggest
that a physical distance (greater or smaller) has been covered in order to reach the
Â�
PERCEPT. In (43) we can imagine the subjects getting as close as possible to the list in
order to see the names (Direct object). In example (44) a given object Â�
(represented by
the clitic lo) is only visible after reaching the peak, i.e. after the perceivers have Â�covered
a considerable distance. In example (45), columbrar slides towards the Â�
meaning TO
DISCOVER: when wandering around a place it is possible to unexpectedly find
and see certain things (idea of involuntary discovery). Here, some subjects discover
a woman accidentally when passing through a given scene. Lastly, (46) constitutes
a slightly more underspecified example, aspectually conceptualized as an immediate
achievement. The subject Fermín discerns an abstract entity (a vision) – introduced by
the Direct object in the form of a relative clause without an explicit antecedent – just
because he opens an eye. In this case, the idea of DISTANCE is not highlighted, so
columbrar is conceptually superposed to ver [to see].
This last observation implies that columbrar in numerous contexts can cancel its
original image of DISTANCE in order to focus on visual achievement. Therefore, it
is not surprising that this verb can be easily complemented by abstract PERCEPTS
in epistemic contexts. When this happens columbrar develops meanings such as
TO UNDERSTAND or TO NOTICE SOMETHING, meanings that ver also often
presents.

	(47)â•…
Tampoco podía columbrar que Villamuera andaba por los despachos

superchería de la prohibición […][…after biting the fruit 131 Genesis 3.6
she has understood the deceit of prohibition]
 (J. Benet Goitia, Saúl ante Samuel 1980)
In example (47) columbrar clearly means TO UNDERSTAND. The third Â�
person
subject or PERCIEVER cannot understand a given fact, codified in the form of a
Â�
subordinate completive which acts as a Direct object, viz., why Villamuera is looking
for him around the offices. The object in (48) is an abstract noun related to a false belief
(a deceit), which almost automatically implies an epistemic or cognitive reading of the
verb columbrar.
Lastly, columbrar can also act as a copulative verb with a subject that refers to the
PERCEPT, both in a purely visual and metaphorical sense:
	(49)â•…
Tras la barba y el bigote negros, se columbraba el rostro de un hombre que
Â�
apenas sobrepasaba los treinta años [Behind the beard and the moustache,

discern the face of a man that was barely more than 30 years old]
 (T. Luca de Tena, Los renglones torcidos de Dios 1979)

[The humid mouthful of darkness made Lorenzo feel the most mortifying
shiver, that chimerical rotation of shapes impulsed by the small flame of the
oil lamp, among which he would soon discern the impossible skull of all
the dangers of death, or the imaginary shadow of a Checkmate] 
 (J. M. Caballero Bonald, Toda la nocheoyeron pasar Â�
pájaros 1981)
Example (49) shows how a subject (the face of a man) can be discerned behind some
superficial elements (a beard and a moustache) that function as physical Â�
barriers. The
use of columbrar suggests that the PERCEPT appears to the PERCEIVER in a Â�
sudden,
unexpected and uncontrolled manner. In (50) the same conceptualization holds, only
on a metaphorical level. Here, a series of fears gradually and progressively (from non-
existence to existence) reveal themselves to the PERCEIVER in the dim candlelight.
This idea of progressive revelation, once again, is reinforced by the underlying concep-
tualization of LIGHT and by the copulative construction by which the PERCEPT fear
or danger is brought into prominence.
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ´ïœ°ïœµ
We hope to have demonstrated that the core meaning of columbrar is related to
the idea of REVELATION BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PERCEPT. It is always the
stimulus that reveals itself to the observer, who merely registers it. The speaker can see
something after covering a distance, or he can discover the percept unexpectedly; but,
in the copulative construction, it is also possible that the percept or stimulus reveals
itself in an uncontrolled way. Natural light allows us to see our surroundings, and
columbrar expresses precisely how that light can sometimes arrive naturally to speak-
ers to show them different aspects of the world, both physical and abstract.
4.â•… Conclusions
As we have proven over these pages, the idea of LIGHT is decisive in human
Â�
experience. People need light to see the world, since the eyes of the Homo sapiens
cannot see Â�
without it. Consequently, this concept is naturally linked to aspects of life
such as survival, security or beauty, metonymical extensions motivated by the Â�
positive
appreciation that man has of light. Similarly, our senses register how this evanescent
entity behaves; light is slippery, random, intermittent and, in short, constitutes an
active category that humans have been able to control only very occasionally over the
course of evolution.
All this experiential knowledge offers the ideal conceptual framework for the
grammaticalization of numerous verbs related to this semantic field. In our study, we
have focused on five verbs that, due to their etymological origins, are directly linked to
the notion of LIGHT. Although they are verbs of a subordinate lexical level (i.e. more
specific than other more general verbs of the category like ver) with a common etymo-
logical background, we hope to have shown they cannot be considered synonymous.
Nevertheless, due to their common connection to the domain of vision (made possible
by light) they automatically share some conceptual areas. Note, for instance, the ease
with which all of these verbs express the possession of knowledge.
However, beyond what they have in common, each of these verbs conceptualizes
different, particular aspects of experience related to LIGHT. Iluminar is able to rep-
resent the idea of beauty through the possession of light, so in its structure the meta-
phor LIGHT IS BEAUTY appears. Alumbrar is more oriented towards the concept
of light as a creative entity, as in the metaphor LIGHT IS THE ORIGIN. Deslumbrar
highlights the ability lights have to blind, and as such, modify other entities (LIGHT
IS POWER). Vislumbrar, in turn, has generated the conceptual metaphor LIGHT IS
FLEETINGNESS to indicate that, sometimes, our vision of things is limited by chance
factors, related to the context or to the nature of the visual object itself. Lastly, colum-
brar shows that LIGHT IS REVELATION, i.e. an evident appearance before the eyes
of the observer. This constellation of semantic nuances is characteristic of the semantic
ïœ´ïœ°ïœ¶	 Jorge Fernández Jaén & Hilde Hanegreefs
richness of LIGHT as a preconceptual prime, and, at the same time, why these verbs
continue to coexist (lack of synonymy).
Another fact worth underlining is that the lexico-constructional behavior of these
verbs fits into a gradual continuum with two opposite poles, one related to causativity
and another one related to visual perception, as shown in the following figure:
iluminar
alumbrar
+ causative + perceptive
vislumbrar
columbrar
deslumbrar
Figure 8.â•‡ Gradual continuum between causativity and visual perception
The causative end is represented by iluminar and alumbrar. Both verbs materialize
actions able to alter the properties of an object and come down to the periphrasis
TO PROJECT LIGHT ONTO SOMETHING. In both cases C conceives of a scene
defined by its epistemic or objective deixis (i.e. with a minimum load of subjectivity)
by Â�
prototypically highlighting the existence of light sources (= syntactic subjects),
pushing into the background any other ‘intentional’ element, including Indirect
objects, which are completely peripheral in the situation described.
At the other end, the visual perception verbs vislumbrar and columbrar can be
situated since they are characterized by a binary schema composed of a PERCEIVER
and a PERCEPT, in which the presence of a beneficiary or Indirect object is Â�completely
excluded. This conceptual schema can adopt different syntactic configurations
Â�
according to how C wishes to present the scene.
The verb deslumbrar, perhaps the most peculiar one of all five, is, on the one hand,
related to iluminar and alumbrar because it is a causative verb, because it prototypically
has NON HUMAN SUBJECTS (sources of light) and because it only very rarely com-
bines with an Indirect object. Also, deslumbrar, as well as alumbrar, easily expresses
the idea of state and capacity, a possibility which is much more unusual (yet, possible)
with iluminar. On the other hand, however, deslumbrar is more clearly related to sight
than iluminar and alumbrar, which is why we have placed it slightly further right in
the continuum proposed. In short, we believe that our work allows us to validate the
fundamental theories of CL in general terms. Experience (both corporal and cultural)
plays a decisive part in linguistic design, which indicates that use is the motor of the
lexicalization of concepts. In our case, the analysis of five different verbs, related to the
	 The concept of light in Spanish denominal verbs	 ïœ´ïœ°ïœ·
domain of LIGHT, shows that categories form overlapping conceptual networks with a
prototypical core and peripheral elements, and that this configuration has a pragmatic
motivation that iconically guides lexico-constructional patterning.

Metaphors as a source of lexical creation
in the field of wine criticism*
Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
University of Alicante
This chapter writes about the metaphor as a source of lexical creation in the field
of wine criticism. More specifically, it delimits the conceptual metaphors acting
in this ambit from a contrastive perspective between Spanish and French. Within
the framework of wine tourism, the paper analyzes a corpus-data obtained from
several wine journals and specialized literature, in which the abundance
of expressions related to the body and eroticism is widely present.
Keywords:â•‡ metaphors; lexical creation; wine criticism; wine tourism
1.â•… Introduction
The aim of this paper is to present an introduction to the analysis of metaphors as a
source of lexical and phrasal creation within the language used in the field of wine
criticism from a contrastive perspective between French and Spanish.
We will describe the conformation of conceptual metaphors within a Â�
framework
of semantic knowledge, an approach that is especially useful since it takes into
account pragmatic factors such as the cultural context and discourse context of use
of these expressions, knowledge of the world and the crystallization of values in the
Â�
consciousness of users of one same cultural identity.
So, in the context of wine tourism, where linguistic and cultural manifestations
are becoming more and more sophisticated, my analysis will be based on the obser-
vation of a corpus extracted from wine tastings and articles published in Â�
specialized
magazines, such as www.mivino.info, or in supplements dedicated to wine from
weekly publications, like Le Point and l’Express, all found on the Internet, both in
French and Spanish. The metaphors under study will be those related to human body,
such as amaigri [thin], charnu/carnoso [ropy], corpulent/corpulento [corpulent],
*â•‡ This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science through
grant HUM2006–09429.
ïœ´ïœ±ïœ°	 Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
costaud [robust], avoir de la chair/tener cuerpo [to have body], avoir de la cuisse [to
have character], or related to eroticism, such as amoureux [in love], ardent/ardiente
Â�[passionate], exubérant/exuberante [exuberant], sensuel/sensual [sensual], voluptueux
[voluptuous], séduisant/seductor [seductive], all this from a contrastive perspective
between French and Spanish.
In this study, I will follow Nubiola (2000) and Llamas (2005) for the interpretation
of the theory of the metaphor in everyday life. In my opinion, these two authors have
been capable of understanding and interpreting the novelty introduced by Lakoff and
Johnson in their study of metaphors, and they perform a lucid and sensible analysis of
this cognitive approach, based on philosophy and linguistics respectively.
When it comes to looking at ways of conceptualizing and identifying Â�metaphorical
and metonymical conceptualization indices in specific contexts, I will follow Â�
Vandaele
(2005, 2006, 2009). In this analysis our aim is to try and illustrate the theory of
Â�
metaphors we live by as a source of lexical creation in the field of wine criticism.
2.â•… 
The theoretical context surrounding the study of ways
of conceptualizing in specific languages
For a better understanding of the analysis I am proposing, it is convenient to describe
the theoretical framework of my study, introducing the theory of metaphors we live by,
by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) in the context of cognitive semantics.
2.1â•… 
Metaphors we live by, by Lakoff and Johnson
As stated by Nubiola (2000), the study of metaphors and, therefore, of bibliographic
tradition, focuses particularly on literary criticism. Traditionally, emphasis is made
on the non-existant cognitive value of metaphors, which have a merely rhetorical
Â�
character. However, over the last few years, some authors have begun to move away
from this conception and propose different approaches to the subject of metaphors
(see Vandaele 2006).
So, a white wine can be oro [gold], ámbar [amber], amarillo paja [straw-coloured].
The colour of a red wine can be ruby, maroon, violet or even vêtu d’une très belle robe
pourpre [wearing a beautiful purple dress]. These expressions are just a sample of the
presence of processes such as the metaphor in lexical creation and of the semantic enrich-
ment of words, as well as their primacy over the literal senses of the expressions used by
critics and amateurs of oenology, both in a professional context and in day-to-day life.
According to Nubiola (2000), considering interaction as an approach for inter-
preting metaphors – introduced by Black (1993) – has a huge influence on the subject
that concerns us. To Lakoff, it would be more a case of projection than interaction, as
he specifies in his postface of the 2003 re-edition of Metaphors We Live By (2003:â•›254).
	 Metaphors as a source of lexical creation in the field of wine criticism	 ïœ´ïœ±ïœ±
The foundation upon which this new approach to metaphors rests consists in
Â�
considering that metaphors hold two different thoughts or conceptual references
within a single expression, the meaning of which is the result of the interaction of
the two elements. So, for example, in the sentence ‘María tiene una salud de hierro’
(literally ‘Mary has a health like iron’) the two simultaneous active thoughts would be
“people with good health are strong” and “iron is a strong, hard, resistant material”.
That way, the elements that compose the metaphor would be identified both with
the sentence and with the general topic they belong to. This new approach is a novelty
in the sense that it groups metaphors in families or topics, metaphorical expressions
being variations of the same subject.
Nubiola makes a very appropriate appreciation of this new pragmatic approach,
which introduces the incipient cognitive semantics in his search to understand human
intelligence: metaphors are no longer seen as “products of artistic activity”, but rather
they are studied as “processes for building meaning”.1 In this revolutionary context,
as regards the conception of metaphors, in 1980 Lakoff and Johnson presented their
theory on metaphors that are generated in everyday life based precisely on basic
Â�
structures of our experience and of our way of thinking.
It is also in this context that my theory of metaphors being a source of lexical
Â�
creation in the field of wine criticism gains meaning.
What are the bases of this conceptual system? What Lakoff and Johnson hold is
that thought is metaphorically structured, and that metaphors make sense in personal
and collective experience. Creative metaphors, which are a part of life and the object
of this study, are precisely of the kind forged in the field of oenology, and that will
be found in the corpus used. The synthesis that Lakoff and Johnson propose aims
to bring together reason, experience and imagination as a base for this conceptual
Â�
system, which structures metaphorical creation. We are looking at what they call
Â�experencialist synthesis.
2.2â•… 
Metaphorical conceptualization as a source of lexical creation
in cognitive semantics: Neology and polysemy
Having reached this point, when considering metaphors as a source of lexical creation
and, in some cases, of polysemy, in the framework of cognitive semantics most cogni-
tivist authors believe that metaphorical and metonymical expressions correspond to a
linguistic representation of the human conceptual system, which uses the process of
projection to categorize some concepts.
ïœ±.â•… The quotation marks have been added by me.
ïœ´ïœ±ïœ²	 Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
It is in this context that Lakoff and Johnson’s theory takes place. From this point,
these cognitive authors agree that the structure of our conceptual system is what is
basically in charge of our metaphorical lexical and phrasal creation. Therefore, meta-
phorical expressions are phenomena of a not merely linguistic character, but also of a
cognitive nature, and are related to the way in which human beings conceive reality.
Thiscommonthoughtisfundamentallybasedontwofacts:ontheonehand,onthe
localization of metaphorical expressions in everyday language and, on the other hand,
on the existence of identical or similar expressions that coincide in various languages,
which leads us to believe that metaphors that are regularly used are not isolated
expressions, but rather they respond to mental patterns that reflect our conception of
the world. Nevertheless, we must not reach the point of identifying conceptual system
with language, thus ignoring all the pragmatic and semantic constraints that each
Â�
language imposes upon a given cognitive model.
Lakoff and Johnson base their theory on linguistic evidence in order to state that
most of our ordinary conceptual system is of a metaphorical nature, meaning that
metaphors are not merely a question of language, but also a cognitive process. This
leads us to infer that the human conceptual system is structured and defined in a meta-
phorical manner. In short, metaphors as linguistic expressions are precisely possible
because they belong to the conceptual system of a person and a culture, although this
does not imply that all individuals are equally able to grasp them and we could go as
far as saying that some people are not able to at all.
So, lexical creation by means of metaphorical conceptualization is very closely
related to cognitive processes and, therefore, goes beyond the limits of a language
system. Metaphors appear in everyday conversations, altering the use of the established
linguistic system and at the same time simplifying our comprehension of reality by
using more basic and familiar concepts.
In this context, and following Llamas (2005:â•›
109–139), we can state that, in
Â�
linguistic and philosophical tradition prior to cognitivism, the formation of meta-
phors and their lexicalization process did not, at first sight, present a clear regularity. In
fact, the semantic-pragmatic description of lexical contents created using metaphors is
still a challenge for linguistics and, for now, only attempts at systematization in specific
fields are made (Vandaele 2006:â•›73).
It is true that some authors had already sensed a certain regularity in the creation
of metaphorical meanings, such as Ullman in 1962, who already establishes various
types of metaphors according to metaphorical content and the forms they acquire
in the language; or Weinrich in 1976, who refers to the fields of images created by
Â�
metaphors; or Bosque in 1982, who points out regularities based on the new under-
standings that the metaphor creates (see Llamas 2005:â•›111).
However, thanks to the cognitive approach, which bears context in mind, we
can move forward in this sense and establish a certain systematization that comes
from Â�
so-called metaphorical conceptualization (Llamas 2005:â•›
111). This consists in
	 Metaphors as a source of lexical creation in the field of wine criticism	 ïœ´ïœ±ïœ³
Â�
observing conceptual patterns in context in order to determine the role of context in
fixing these patterns.
So, the key to this new approach lies in the notion of prototype, which appears
in the heart of sociolinguistics and consists in admitting the influence of the general
and shared knowledge of a linguistic community on the world when it comes to con-
forming metaphorical meanings. However, the structuralist idea of componenciality
of meaning is also shared, and can be defined as a conjunction of distinctive and func-
tional features. From the perspective of cognitive semantics, these features acquire a
different dimension: they establish oppositions between classes of things, not between
meanings (see Llamas 2005:â•›113).
3.â•… 
Metaphors in the language of wine criticism
According to Vandaele (2006:â•›73), the importance of metaphorical conceptualization
(MC) is reflected in the existence of numerous studies on this phenomenon, not only
in day-to-day life, but also in economics, business, literature and sciences, such as
Â�
biology and medicine.
La compréhensión de la CM d’un domaine nous semble constituer un outil
cognitif puissant dans le processus de traduction (et de rédaction), bien que les
études en traductologie soient plutôt rares et récentes, la problématique étant
traditionnellement abordée sous l’angle des théories classiques de la métaphore
comme élément déviant ou rhétorique. (Vandaele 2006:â•›73)
So, in order to illustrate the theory proposed up to now, I have used two Â�
comparable
corpus, one in Spanish and another in French, constituted by texts on wine criticism
and wine-tasting in these two languages.
However, the problem is posed at the very moment of identifying Â�
metaphorical
expressions.Inordertoidentifythem,wemustestablishtheconceptualmetaphorsthey
depend on. A conceptual metaphor is an abstract pattern under which Â�
metaphorical
expressions are grouped, while a metaphorical expression is an individual and specific
case of a conceptual metaphor.
In an attempt to find an epistemological base to the problem of metaphorical
Â�
conceptualization and of the consequent identification of the corresponding meta-
phorical expressions and their conceptualization indices, Vandaele (2009) suggests
bringing the concepts and epistemology underlying this methodology up to date in
order to establish a precise method of identification and analysis of the metaphorical
expressions in the various corpus under study.
This author bases her theory on Lakoff’s (1980) conception, which considers metaÂ�
phors as cognitive processes that are expressed in discourse by means of metaphorical
expressions which reflect the projection of a source domain (Vandaele 2009:â•›187–188)
upon a target domain, especially emphasising the distinction between metaphorical
ïœ´ïœ±ïœ´	 Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
conceptualization and its linguistic expression, as well as the fact that the metaphorical
process constitutes one of the foundations of human thought.
In the same chapter, Vandaele (2009:â•›190) proposes the term indice de conceptuali-
sation [conceptualization index] (IC) to designate the linguistic unit used for projection
and which evokes at least two representations, one true (représentation factive) and
one fictional (représentation fictive). Furthermore, in order to avoid the tendency to
identify metaphors with the figures of speech used in the field of rhetoric, as shown in
the abundant literature on the subject, I will use the terminology proposed by Â�Vandaele,
who prefers to talk about ways of conceptualizing for the treatment of metaphors,
Â�
precisely to avoid conventional connotations related to the term “metaphor”.
Lastly, there is an additional reason for this author to choose the mentioned
Â�
terminology in order to refer to ways of conceptualizing, and that is because she
believes these terms not only include phenomena such as metaphors, but can also
be used as metonymic expressions and can even be confused and merged with what
Â�
cognitivist authors agree on calling métaphtonymie (Vandaele 2009:â•›
192).2 This
Â�
clarification and expansion is particularly interesting in this study, because there are a
number of examples of this kind in the corpus used.
Once the conceptual problem has been clarified, let us go back to the subject of
the identification of metaphorical expressions. As we have already seen, Vandaele,
in her attempt to identify metaphorical expressions, introduced in 2005 (Vandaele
2005:â•›Â�421–426 and 2006:â•›74–75) a clarifying concept: that of the indice de conceptualisa-
tion Â�métaphorique [metaphorical conceptualization index] (ICM). The ICM is the main
element in metaphorical expressions, which allows us to identify metaphors accord-
ing to Â�
cognitive dissonance. The difficulty to identify theses expressions lies in the fact
that ICM is a cognitive phenomenon and, therefore, we cannot use morphological
nor Â�
syntactic criteria. The appropriate resource for their identification is of a cognitive
nature: it is based on the linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge of the speaker, which
in turn is based on empirical data obtained by gathering a genuine corpus. This identi-
fication criteria is born of the perception of a cognitive dissonance on behalf of the sub-
ject, and emerges when the speaker realizes that the referent found in the discourse can
be conceptualized in two different and simultaneous ways, which Talmy labels Â�
fictive
representation and factive representation (Quoted by Vandaele 2006:â•›75).
The special field on which my analysis focuses is that of wine criticism. So, using
the examples selected in French and Spanish, I will establish conceptual metaphors
with their corresponding metaphorical and/or metonymical expressions, comparing,
when appropriate, the expressions used in both languages.
ïœ².â•… According to Vandaele, the first to identify the phenomenon of “métaphtonymie” was
Louis Goossens in“Metaphtonymy: the interaction of metaphor and metonymy in expressions
for linguistic action”, Cognitive Linguistics, 1990, 1: 323–340.
	 Metaphors as a source of lexical creation in the field of wine criticism	 ïœ´ïœ±ïœµ
AccordingtoLakoffandJohnson(1980:â•›24),aconceptismetaphoricallyÂ�structured
in terms of another concept. That is what they call “conceptual metaphors”. Therefore,
the analysis I am proposing is based on the conceptual metaphor of the Â�personification
of wine: WINE IS A PERSON. As a consequence of this metaphor, come all the rest: so,
as a person, THE WINE IS A MAN OR THE WINE IS A WOMAN, THE WINE HAS
AN AGE, THE WINE HAS FEELINGS AND BEHAVIOR, THE WINE LIVES IN
SOCIETY, THE WINE HAS A BODY and consequently THE WINE HAS A NOSE,
THE WINE HAS LEGS, THE WINE HAS TEARS.
We can safely say that these metaphorical expressions are deeply rooted in the
culture of the wine and, in a way, are conventional expressions between professionals
and amateurs of wine-tasting and tourism, as we can see in the terms used to describe
wine in texts on wine-tasting and in think pieces on wine criticism.
Let us start with the descriptions based on the conceptual metaphor “WINE IS A
PERSON”.
We also find anthropomorphic metaphorical expressions referring to the “body” of
the wine or even to the “health” of the wine as if it were a person, and so the wine can be
delgado /maigre [thin], carnoso/charnu [ropy], robusto/costaud [robust], corpulento/cor-
pulent [corpulent], vigoroso/vigoureux [vigorous], anémico [anaemic], nervioso/nerveux
[nervous], con piernas o lágrimas/avec des jambes ou des larmes [with legs or tears], con
mucho cuerpo [full-bodied], vif [lively], musclé mais sans dureté [muscly but not hard], à
la structure tendue et solide [with a tight and solid structure], franchement magnifique par
sa tonicité et sa complexité [frankly magnificent due to its tone and complexity]. A wine
can have une colonne vertébrale droite, autour de laquelle la chair est belle et gourmande [a
straight back bone, around which the body is beautiful and greedy] or un corps complet
[a complete body], un cuerpo sedoso [a silky body]. La robe orangée très claire annonce un
corps de grande finesse [The very clear orangey dress announces an extremely fine body].
Other expressions refer to gender, making a wine femenino/féminin [feminine],
masculino/masculin [masculine], viril/viril [manly].
But what do these adjectives mean when applied to wine? Let us take as an
Â�
example the adjective femenino [femenine], what is a femenino [femenine] wine? “Se
dice de los vinos tintos en los que domina la suavidad sobre la astringencia. El bouquet
está compuesto por matices Â�
dulces, muy maduros (confituras de frutos rojos, ciruelas
pasas). El tanino es suave y el vino provoca en la cata sensaciones aterciopeladas. Cier-
tas variedades de uva, como la pinot noir, se prestan a elaborar estos vinos sutiles”3
(Wiesenthal 2001:â•›353).
ïœ³.â•… [It applies to red wines in which the smoothness is predominant over the astringency.
The bouquet is composed of sweet, very ripe flavours (preserves made with red berries, dry
apricots). The tannin is smooth and when tasted, the wine causes velvety sensations. Certain
varieties of grape, such as the Pinot Noir, lend themselves to making these subtle wines].
ïœ´ïœ±ïœ¶	 Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
This means that the adjective acquires a new meaning and, in this sense, we can
say that it is polysemous, since it presents a new sense of the word in a specific and
Â�
professional context. The lexical creation in this case has been carried out by means of
the conceptual metaphor “the wine is a woman”, and has the appropriate Â�characteristics,
such as the smoothness and the velvety feel.
Another qualifier applied to wine that we can study is delgado [thin]: “vino con
poco cuerpo, flaco, con poco extracto [a wine with little body, slim, with little extract]”
(Wiesenthal 2001:â•›287). Based on the conceptual metaphor “the wine is a person”, the
adjective delgado in this context also acquires the new technical sense of “con poco
extracto [with little extract]”, which means we are looking at another example of a
neologism created by a metaphor.
As a consequence of the main conceptual metaphor THE WINE IS A PERSON,
we obtain the following metaphors: THE WINE HAS AN AGE, THE WINE HAS
FEELINGS AND PERSONALITY, THE WINE LIVES IN SOCIETY, THE WINE
HAS A BODY and consequently THE WINE HAS A NOSE, THE WINE HAS LEGS,
THE WINE HAS TEARS.
Let us continue with expressions that refer to the time of life in order to describe
a wine as joven/jeune [young], maduro/mûr [mature], viejo/vieux [old], corto/court
[short], longevo [long-lived], fugaz/fugace [fleeting], largo/long [long], evolucionado/
evolutionné [evolved], marchito/fané [withered], encore marqué par son fruité de Â�jeunesse
[still marked by its fruitiness of youth]. Or a wine peut encore vieillir longtemps. Sa
Â�
couleur évolue en fonction de son âge, du jaune paille clair au marron soutenu, en passant
par toutes les teintes de cuivré, topaze, vieil or et ambré [can have yet to age. Its colour
evolves according to its age, from pale clear yellow to deep brown, passing through all
shades of copper, topaz, old gold and amber]. “Tienen estos juveniles vinos tal exceso de
colores, ofrecen tales sensaciones de vibrante juventud en el paladar (…), La Mancha, con
sus múltiples facetas varietales, se ha convertido en un semillero de vinos jóvenes donde
poder elegir el sabor deseado.” [These wines have such an excess of colour, offer such
sensations of vibrant youth to the palate (…), La Mancha, with its multiple varietal
facets, has become a seedbed for young wines from which to choose the desired taste].
For example, the adjective joven [young] when applied to wines means: “vino sin
crianza en el que se han buscado las cualidades afrutadas y más frescas. La Â�
mayoría
de los vinos blancos y rosados se embotellan jóvenes, recién elaborados. Algunas
variedades, como la garnacha, la gamay, la tempranillo y la merlot se prestan a la
elaboración de sensuales y deliciosos vinos tintos jóvenes”4 (Wiesenthal 2001:â•›
469).
ïœ´.â•… [Wine with no raising in which the qualities of fruitiness and freshness have been sought.
Most white and rosé wines are bottled young, when newly made. Some varieties, such as
Grenache, Gamay, Tempranillo and Merlot, lend themselves to the making of sensual and
delicious young red wines].
	 Metaphors as a source of lexical creation in the field of wine criticism	 ïœ´ïœ±ïœ·
Similarly, when speaking of the juventud [youth] of a wine, we are referring to a wine
with no raising.
Thus, joven acquires a new special nuance when referred to wine, expressing lack
of raising and this quality is normally limited to white and rosé wines and to reds
elaborated with certain varieties of grapes. This use covers the professional fields of
viticulture, wine-tasting and wine criticism.
The adjectives corto/largo [short/long], however, although in general discourse
express a given extension in space or a duration in time, when referring to wine acquire
a new specific sense which makes an allusion to the persistence or duration of its taste
on the palate and of its aroma in the after-taste.
If we continue with the conceptual metaphor “The wine is a person”, we can also
observe that it is described in terms of feelings and personality, temperament, as if it
were a human being: THE WINE HAS FEELINGS AND PERSONALITY, BEHAVIOR.
It is, therefore, said that a wine is agresivo/aggressif [aggressive], disfrutamos de
vinos de paladar muy bien equilibrado, nada agresivos, con una impensable Â�suavidad [we
enjoy wines of a very balanced, not at all aggressive palate, of unthinkable Â�smoothness],
amable/aimable [kind], vulgar/vulgaire [vulgar], austero/austère Â�[austere], brutal/
brutal [brutal], discreto/discret [discrete], generoso/généreux [generous]: “Su fino Pie-
dra Luenga es uno de los pocos generosos que lucen esa etiqueta, Esos grandes genero-
sos Â�
llegaron a ser tan famosos que posiblemente no había rincón en el planeta donde,
al menos, no hubiesen llegado noticias de ellos” [Their fine Piedra Luenga is one of
few generous (wines) to display that label”, “Those great generous (wines) became
so famous there was possibly not a corner of the planet where they had not at least
heard news of them], honesto/honnête [honest], fogoso/fougeux [fiery], con personali-
dad y encanto [with personality], encantador/charmant [charming], Â�
délicat [delicate],
Â�
gracieux [graceful]. Or ce vin a une belle tenue, la bouche est franche et fraîche [this
wine has a beautiful presence, its mouth is frank and fresh]. A wine can be puissant
mais franc et parfaitement sec [powerful but frank and perfectly dry].
But, what is a amable [kind] wine? A amable wine is “ligeramente más dulce que
abocado, que se caracteriza por que todos sus aspectos son agradables, sin resultar
demasiado fuertes [slightly sweeter than intended, characterized by all of its aspects
being pleasant, and not coming across as too strong]” (Wiesenthal 2001:â•›
46). And,
what is an honesto [honest] or fogoso [fiery] wine? Are these random metaphorical
uses, depending solely on a stylistic licence, not a critical one? We will see that this
is not the case, that honesto and fogoso have precise – neological – meanings in the
context of wine evaluation. Honesto is a “sencillo, con sabor franco, que no presenta
defectos [simple wine, with a frank taste and no flaws]” (Wiesenthal 2001:â•›440) and
fogoso refers to the “carácter brioso y franco que presentan ciertos vinos jóvenes que
aún manifiestan sus cualidades con cierta ingenuidad, sin llegar a un equilibrio firme.
También se dice de los vinos demasiado alcohólicos [spirited and frank character that
certain young wines present, which show their qualities with certain naivety, not Â�having
ïœ´ïœ±ïœ¸	 Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
reached a firm balance. It is also said of excessively alcoholic wines]” Â�
(Wiesenthal
2001:â•›372). What is an austero [austere] wine? It is “inexpresivo, elemental y algo tosco.
Es un defecto propio de los vinos elaborados con uvas de linaje vulgar y neutro o que
no han alcanzado su desarrollo [inexpressive, elementary and somewhat crude. It is a
fault typical of wines elaborated using grapes of a vulgar and neutral lineage or that
have not fully developed]” (Wiesenthal 2001:â•›77).
We can therefore see that, apparently, to an inexperienced audience unfamiliar
with the language of wine, these uses are obscure and mysterious, metaphorical,
not in accordance with their general meaning. But at the same time, they are not
random, but already belong to the socio-professional jargon of wine and, therefore,
have a specific and precise referent, meaning something different than in general
language.
Any behavior that suggests elegance and delicacy is often attributed to wine:
fins, profonds, onctueux et raffinés, sans aucune lourdeur ni violence, les vins de
Rayas allient comme aucun autre complexité et profondeur [fine, deep, unctuous and
refined, without a trace of heaviness nor violence, the wines of Rayas combine like
no other complexity and depth]. Très raffiné dans ses sensations tactiles, naturel, le
contraire d’un vin Â�
rustique de certain traditionalistes locaux, car c’est le meilleur de la
tradition qui est en oeuvre ici. Un model de style pour le secteur. [Very refined in its
tactile sensations, natural, Â�
contrary to the rustic wine of certain local traditionalists,
since it is the best tradition we see at work here. A model of style for the sector].
Wines can also have style accompli [accomplished style] or finura [finesse]: la finesse
est ici superlative et se place au service d’une matière dense et satinée [finesse here is
superlative and is placed at the service of a dense, satiny substance]. Quelle finesse
dans ce rivesaltes délicat! [Such finesse in this delicate Rivesaltes!], destaca su finura
y delicadeza y nunca defrauda [its finesse and delicacy are outstanding and it never
disappoints], un vino con raza y finura [a wine with rearing and finesse], fino Quinto,
que tiene finura y temperamento [fine Quinto, with finesse and temperament]. The
mention of elegance along with natural qualities is frequent in the language of wine:
le nez est élégant, très pur, avec une note de grillé [the nose is elegant, very pure, with
a toasted hint], la elegancia del tanino [the elegance of tannin], estos vinos derro-
chan tanta naturalidad intrínseca (…) [these wines are brimming with such intrinsic
natural character (…)].
Finura applied to wine is “cualidad de un vino delicado y elegante [the quality of a
delicate and elegant wine]” (Wiesenthal 2001:â•›368). But this definition is still obscure.
After all, what is a delicado [delicate] and elegante [elegant] wine? Elegante [elegant]
is a “distinguido, Â�
elaborado con variedades nobles, armonioso en el color y el aroma,
equilibrado en el gusto y con la justa crianza. Un vino blanco elegante se caracteriza
sobre todo porque tiene acidez frutal, sin llegar a ser verde pero sin ser plano. Un
	 Metaphors as a source of lexical creation in the field of wine criticism	 ïœ´ïœ±ïœ¹
vino tinto elegante se caracteriza por un tanino intenso y aterciopelado, dotado de
músculo y estructura”.5 And so, although there are still incomprehensible metaphors
in the definition, it is clear that the qualities of elegancia [elegance] and finura have a
specific meaning in this context and, therefore, a neological meaning different to that
of general language, based not only on the conceptual metaphor “THE WINE IS A
PERSON”, but also on the mention of the “noble” varieties it is made with.
A wine is said to be expresivo/expressif [expressive], exuberante/exubérant
Â�[exuberant], de alta expresión/de haute expression [highly expressive]: une des hautes
Â�
expressions du vermentino dans le monde [one of the highest expressions of Vermen-
tino in the world]. Uno de mis favoritos es el fino de El Maestro Sierra, por su gran
expresividad [One of my favourites is the fine wine of El Maestro Sierra, for its great
expressiveness], Como el equilibrado y expresivo Espinapura, que elabora la casa Sauci
[Like the balanced and expressive Espinapura, made by the Sauci house].
What does expresivo mean? If it could talk, it would be spontaneous and transpar-
ent. Thus, an expresivo [expressive] wine is, metaphorically, one that clearly shows its
qualities: it is easy to tell the variety with which it has been made due to its unmistakable
qualities (Wiesenthal 2001:â•›346).
THE WINE HAS A SOCIAL LIFE and so, it is civilizado/civilisé [civilized], noble/
noble [noble], aristocrático/aristocratique [aristocratic], rico/riche [rich], rústico/Â�rustique
[rustic], distinguido/distingué [distinguished], opulento/opulent [opulent], señorial
[lordly], fino/fin [refined], de grande classe [of high class]. Riche et puissant, gourmand et
harmonieux.Touteslessaveurssontlà,àleurplace,pourunplaisirtrèsgrand.D’unÂ�élégance
rare. Tous les terroirs ne peuvent pas donner de beaux grains nobles [Rich and power-
ful, greedy and harmonious. All the flavours are there, in there place, offering a huge
Â�
pleasure. Of a rare elegance. All the land could not give such Â�
beautiful noble grapes]. An
aristocrático wine is one that “procedente de una variedad de noble linaje. Suele aplicarse
solo a los vinos secos, a los grandes vinos espumosos y a los mejores jereces, sauternes y
oportos [comes from a variety of noble lineage. It is Â�
normally applied only to dry wines,
to the great sparkling wines and the best sherries, Sauternes and ports]” (Wiesenthal
2001:â•›66). A new example, therefore, of Â�
conventional metaphorical use.
But maybe it is the erotic-sensual love-related field which is most recurrent when
it comes to expressing the sensations caused while tasting certain wines. So, we are
told that “este vino cuenta con sensuales notas de fruta tropical” [this wine has sensual
ïœµ.â•… [Distinguished wine, elaborated with noble varieties, harmonious in colour and aroma,
balanced in taste and with the right rearing.An elegant white wine is characterized Â�
especially
because it has a fruity acidity,not quite green but not plain.An elegant red wine is Â�characterized
by an intense and velvety tannin, endowed with muscle and structure].
ïœ´ïœ²ïœ°	 Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
notes of tropical fruits] or mention is made of unsatisfied passions: los viejos oportos de
añada alimentaron una pasión que aún me posee, pero que pocas veces puedo satisfacer
[old seasonal ports fed a passion that still possesses me, but that I can rarely satisfy].
However, these sensations can end up deriving in feelings towards the desired prod-
uct: posiblemente sea debido a esta afición por lo que me abalanzo ilusionado cuando
tengo conocimiento de estos vinos [it may be because of that fondness that I excitedly
leap when I hear of these wines]. The qualities of wine can even cause the critic to fall
in love: [son sus virtudes …, unas virtudes que me enamoran] these are its virtues…,
virtues that make me fall in love.
A wine can be seductor/seducteur [seductive], sensual/sensuel [sensual], Â�voluptuoso
[voluptuous], savoureux [juicy], charnu [ropy], avec beaucoup de chair [with a good
body], assez virile mais sans dureté [quite manly but not harsh], Toutes les saveurs sont
là, à leur place, pour un plaisir très grand [All the flavours are there, in there place,
offering a huge pleasure]. Disfrutamos de vinos de paladar muy bien equilibrado, nada
agresivos, con una impensable suavidad, La Mancha, con sus múltiples facetas varietales,
se ha convertido en un semillero de vinos jóvenes donde poder elegir el sabor deseado.
[We can also enjoy wines of a balanced palate, not at all aggressive, with unthinkable
smoothness. La Mancha, with its multiple varietal facets, has become a seedbed for
young wines from which to choose the desired taste].
The reader also receives suggestions as to a series of pleasurable and stimulating
sensations associated with the product. The reader is provided with a recreation of a
wide array of sensations that can be felt when tasting a glass of wine. Â�
Sensations of
plenitud [fullness] that range from exuberancia sensual [sensual exuberance] to a Â�caricia
voluptuosa [voluptuous caress] or el gozo pleno [complete enjoyment’]. À apprécier lente-
ment. Un moment de grand plaisir [To appreciate slowly. A moment of great pleasure].
Lastly, the use of metaphors or similes generally aims to enhance the strength
of the sensations caused by the wine or to sublimate the value of the product.
Â�
Personification in this sense is very common, since human properties and qualities
are constantly applied to wine. Thus, el vino require tiempo [wine requires time], está
bien dotado [is well endowed], es honrado, esbelto o resabiado [is honourable, slender
or crafty]. In addition, the description of the tasting is expressed in a way that invites
us to compare it with someone’s physical features: tiene una nariz cálida, mediterránea
[It has a warm, Mediterranean nose], un nez de grand style (a nose of great style), su
boca es carnosa [its juicy mouth] and posee un cuerpo esbelto pero firme [it possesses
a slender but firm body] or Vêtu d’une très belle robe pourpre, la grande Cuvée 2004
se caractérise par une palette aromatique complexe se développant sur des fruits mûrs,
des épices [wearing a beautiful purple dress, the great Cuvée 2004 is characterized by
a complex aromatic palate developing upon ripe fruits, spices]; they have a bouche
serrée, un peu rugueuse [tight mouth, slightly rough], bouche ronde, épicée, assez virile
mais sans dureté, très persistante [round mouth, spicy, quite manly but not harsh, very
	 Metaphors as a source of lexical creation in the field of wine criticism	 ïœ´ïœ²ïœ±
persistent], bouche souple [supple mouth], bouche ronde,gourmande, assez fine, souple
[round mouth, greedy, quite refined, supple]. Human actions are also attributed to
wines: ce vin recherche la compagnie de magrets de canard [this wine seeks the company
of duck breast], destaca su finura y delicadeza y nunca defrauda. En estos momentos los
vinos que mejor expresan su carácter frutal son los canarios [its finesse and delicacy are
outstanding and never disappoint. At present, the wines that best express their fruity
character are Canary wines].
And by extension, other metaphors refer to the world of sensations which are
Â�
perceived in wines that are dulce/doux [sweet], rudo/rude [rough], tierno/tendre
Â�[tender], suave/suave [smooth], disfrutamos de vinos de paladar muy bien equilibrado,
nada agresivos, con una impensable suavidad [we can enjoy wines with a very balanced
palate, not at all aggressive, of unthinkable smoothness], untuoso/onctueux [unctuous],
mordiente/mordant [biting], rasposo/râpeux [rough], caliente/chaud [warm], amargo/
amer [bitter], áspero/âpre [coarse], astringente/astringent [astringent], seco/sec [dry].
Texture is also mentioned, accompanied by highly expressive adjectives that suggest the
most varied and original sensations: Texture sumptueuse [sumptuous texture]. Â�
Texture
grasse, souple gourmande [ropy, supple, greedy texture]. À la fois mentholé et fruits
Â�exotiques [at the same time minty and exotic fruits]. Notes de miel, d’abricot, de menthol,
d’épices fines [hints of honey, apricot, menthol, fine spices]. Boisé, épices, fruits confits, un
vin très plaisant, comme on les aime [wooded, spices, glacé fruits, a very pleasant wine,
just as we like them]. Un vin éclatant, vif, harmonieux, franchement magnifique par sa
tonicité et sa complexité [an explosive, lively wine, harmonious, frankly magnificent due
to its tone and complexity]. Vin d’une richesse aromatique presque extravagante [wine
of an almost extravagant aromatic richness], aromas frutosos, florales, de hierbas, de
golosinas, muy original, con su pálido color y sus aromas tan punzantes [aromas of fruits,
flowers, herbs, sweets, very original, with its pale colour and penetrating aromas].
In short, the texts we have observed are characterized by the profusion of Â�
stylistic
resources enhanced by the images that sight, smell, taste and sometimes even feel
Â�
generated in the mind of the reader, associating the product with a whole magical and
sensual array that transcends the strict physical or chemical qualities of the product.
The language of wine is full of metaphorical uses that refer to semantic fields such as
art, design, music, erotics, sensuality, the human body, feelings and behavior, human
virtues, etc. all of which are used to glorify the product, almost associating it with
meanings that approach the sublime and sacred.
4.â•… 
Summary and conclusions
Metaphorical expressions in the language of wine criticism are not a merely Â�
linguistic
or stylistic phenomenon, but are tightly linked to the conceptual categorization of
ïœ´ïœ²ïœ²	 Montserrat Planelles Iváñez
our life experience and, therefore, are cognitive phenomena, taking a central place in
our ordinary thinking system and our language. So, we can state that metaphorical
Â�conceptualization is a source of lexical creation, which gives new meanings or nuances
to lexical units in the socio-professional context of wine criticism and tasting. Profes-
sionals, experts and amateurs from the wine world make the most of that capacity of
the human mind to understand reality, conceptualize it and categorize it, and to give
names to new concepts and new realities, often using general words, which acquire a
new – polysemous – meaning in the specific context of wine-tasting. So, the presence
of metaphorical expressions does not always reflect the creation of a lexical neologism,
but it does imply a new nuance added to the meaning, enriching it within a context, as
we have seen, such as the case of the adjective joven.
Metaphors in wine criticism can be identified thanks to the linguistic units known
as “indices of metaphorical conceptualization”, which reveal the key to the existence of
cognitive Â�
dissonance in a given expression, evoking at least two representations, one
fictional and one real, which are projected one onto the other.
The metaphorical neologisms we have looked at in our corpus possess a certain
regularity both in French and in Spanish, which is related, especially, not only to the
ability of the human mind to conceptualize realities, but also to elements and factors
that belong to the field of sociolinguistics, such as establishing values and fashions in a
society or linguistic community.
In short, we can conclude that this methodology proposed by cognitive authors
such as Vandaele, mainly based on the theory of metaphors we live by, by Lakoff and
Johnson, sheds new light on the identification, interpretation and analysis of certain
metaphorical expressions in context, not easily identified partly due to their clarity,
but that are presented as neological lexical units in the discourse in which they appear.

On deverbal word formation as condensation
of previous mental patterns*
Estanislao Ramón Trives
University of Murcia
This chapter approaches the lexigenetic processes of deverbalization. It raises the
question whether we simply come across words as we speak or, rather, use them
as a starting point. Although there is a feeling to believe the former and to argue
that there are parallel predicactantial processes, both analytical and synthetic,
this paper still attempts to comprehend the process of production of new words
in which the sense, in a dynamic perspective, is successively immersed within a
continuum, between two states of synchrony.
Keywords:â•‡ lexigenetic processes, deverbalization, conceptualization
1.â•… The status of deverbal word formation
It is debatable whether the transformational process exists or at what level of the Â�process
of speaking it intervenes, whether we simply come across words as we speak or, rather,
use them as a starting point. Although I feel inclined to believe the former, and would
argue that there are parallel predicactantial processes, both analytical and synthetic, we
still try to become aware of the process of production of new words in which the sense,
is successively immersed, within a continuum, between a synchronya and synchronyb,
since “every language is the product of change and Â�
continues to change as long as it is
spoken”, as Langacker (1967:â•›179) says.
2.â•… Is thinking previous to speaking?
We can start with the assumption that our thinking is previous to our speaking, as an
integrated process that ends in a particular verbalization. In a similar sense, we can
observe what we stated above (1979:â•›85–86):
*â•… I would like to thank my colleague Javier Valenzuela for his help with my English and for
his linguistic precisions.
ïœ´ïœ²ïœ¶	 Estanislao Ramón Trives
la lengua concreta lo condensa o puede condensarlo todo, pero lo que ella va
Â�
condensando no surge de sus ubres sino sólo relativamente, puesto que es la
propia realidad la que, objetivada a nuestra vista, a nuestros sentidos, a nuestra
percepción en suma, y hecha concepto, se convierte en lengua concreta, sin que
podamos precisar cuándo, pero teniendo que reconocer un tiempo. Y si hay que
dar razón de ese surgir, puesto que nada puede ser desproporcionado a su causa,
entitativamente, siquiera sea simultáneamente, la lengua concreta entra por los
sentidos junto con la experiencia. Aunque, por supuesto, aprendiésemos un
disco grabado del conjunto operativo de una lengua concreta, sin la atadura de
la ‘experiencia’, eso quedaría ‘acústica pura’ y no lengua. Pero, valga el símil, la
máquina en funcionamiento, no es preciso que la chispa siga produciéndose. La
lengua, en efecto, puede provocar y provoca nuevas y profundas experiencias,
puesto que la “lengua concreta” no es más que una “experiencia objetivada”, capaz
de seguir produciendo experiencias no vividas.
The compass of our speaking and especially of our saying, with its ever-changing
pointer, points to the north of coexistence, which in turn is constantly changing. In
that sense, it is important that we take into account Greimas’s opinion (1968:â•›16–17)
as he states the following:
Peu importe que le contenu du syntagme gestuel soit conscient ou inconscient
–cette dichotomie, on le sait, n’est pas pertinente en linguistique– si, dans un
cas comme dans l’autre, le programme gestuel donné est, pour le sujet, un bloc
signifiant démarqué.
C’est l’introduction du sujet dans l’analyze de la signification qui semble
pouvoir rendre compte des différentes formes qu’elle est susceptible de
prendre,… Il s’agirait simplement de faire la distinction devenue classique entre
le sujet de l’énoncé et le sujet de l’énonciation. On voit, en effet, qu’au niveau de
la sémiotique linguistique, les deux sujets, bien que distincts originellement, le
locuteur appartenant à l’ordre non linguistique du statut de la communication
en tant qu’émetteur de messages, le sujet verbal relevant de l’ordre du discours
linguistique, peuvent entrer en syncrétisme dans les énoncés de type “je marche”
[“j’accuse”, we can say, if we are looking for the nearest to the spanish utterance, “yo
acuso”], où “je” est à la fois sujet dans l’énoncé et sujet de l’énonciation “je marche”
(nous n’introduisons pas ici, pour le moment, le problème du référent)…. Dans la
gestualité communicative, l’homme est le sujet de l’énonciation: il est un “tu” pour
nous, mais un “je “ pour lui-même dans la mesure où il cherche désespérément à
produire et à transmettre des énoncés.
Indeed, as we have pointed out above, verbal autonomy – the autonomous Â�
behavior
of any language – is but a relative one, because although words are things – our
human things, the truth, our truth –, the fact is that without experience, Â�
without that
Â�
permanent dialogue of the speaker with its radical other, with the experience between
experiences, they could never even exist, in an absolute independence with respect
to reality, whose umbilical cord cannot be broken, if we do not want to fall into the
	 On deverbal word formation as condensation of previous mental patterns	 ïœ´ïœ²ïœ·
most absolute and incommunicable aphasia. Which brings us to the important work
of Greimas (1968), already mentioned, since the ever communicating human being
is in a constant exchange with its experiential environment, being itself a Â�
constantly
active result of its own experience, experience between experiences. In that sense, it is
important that we take into account the words of Greimas (1968:â•›3):
L’affirmation de l’arbitraire du signe, tout en permettant des progrès considérables
dans la connaissance de la structure interne des langues dites naturelles, n’a pas
manqué d’élargir, par ses conséquences d’abord imprévisibles, la problématique
du statut du langage et d’introduire le linguiste à une interrogation sur les
possibilités d’une théorie sémiotique généralisée, responsable de toutes les
formes et de toutes les manifestations de la signification. En effet, si le rapport
entre le signifiant et le signifié, au niveau du signe, c’est-à-dire, du mot ou d’une
unité syntagmatique quelconque, est arbitraire, il l’est aussi au niveau de tous les
discours par lesquels la langue est présente à nous: elle est une forme -ou, mieux,
l’enchevêtrement de deux formes- indifférente à la substance dans laquelle elle
se trouve manifestée.
Il suffit d’inverser le point de vue pour se rendre compte que la seule
présence concevable de la signification dans le monde est sa manifestation dans
la “substance” qui englobe l’homme; le monde dit sensible devient ainsi l’objet,
dans sa totalité, de la quête de la signification, il se présente, dans son ensemble
et dans ses articulations, comme une virtualité de sens. La signification peut se
cacher sous toutes les apparences sensibles, elle est derrière les sons, mais aussi
derrière les images, les odeurs et les saveurs, sans pour autant être dans les sons
ou dans les images.
2.1â•… No language without thinking
If our thinking, stricto et concluso sensu, were absolutely ‘verbal’, we could not speak
any language, neither our own nor any other. At an ontogenetic level or maturation of
a verbal process, our brain keeps on internalizing experiences and Â�
condenses them in
the form of a ‘text’, which it multiplies, with its maximum potentiality, as a ‘word’ as
a result of experiential learning, which, from verbal maturation, progressively, evolu-
tionarily, remains, with effective capacity for new and finer training.
2.2â•… Some cases of deverbal word formation in Spanish
Below, we have reproduced our reflection from 1979:â•›
209, where we said, with the
clarifications that we add at this moment, the following:
Al verbalizar o relatorizar la circunstancia (en el campo léxico-verbal del
alojamiento, por ejemplo), la completud ejercida por la concreción de la
circunstancia, valga la expresión, está en la línea específica de la rección verbal,
exigida por su semismo específico o semantemático, dándose una serie de
correspondencias sémico-selectivas n-ádicas –HABITAR (habitante, habitación),
ïœ´ïœ²ïœ¸	 Estanislao Ramón Trives
HOSPEDARSE (huésped, hospedería), ALOJARSE (alojado, alojamiento),..–, en
clara proporcionalidad con otras de otros ámbitos –COMER (comensal, comida,
comedor),ESCRIBIR(escritor,escrito,escritorio)…–,enevidenteanalogíaconlos
procedimientos de deverbalización–, y otras, finalmente, del tipo CONTEMPLAR
(contemplante/contemplador, contemplado), por caso, donde, indudablemente,
no se trata de verbalización o relatorización de circunstancia alguna.
2.2.1â•… Mental control of deverbal word formation
Let us add, to the purposes of this point, what we said in Note 468, of the same place
1979:â•›209. It is, indeed, true that between the Spanish lexemes of the lexical field of
lodging {(habitar, vivir [to inhabit, to live])/cambiar de domicilio [to change residence
[(desalojar [to vacate])}, the particular requirement for local specificity within these
Spanish lexemes is motivated by the semantic change or semantic derivation to which
the system of the language – not by spontaneous generation, and without any mental
control whatsoever, as we in this place hold – has subjected them by development of the
original term, according to the approach of Charles Bally, Linguistique Générale et Lin-
guistique Française, ([1932] 1950), which Eugenio Coseriu reproduces in his Principios
de semántica estructural (1977b).
3.â•… The preverbal level of word changing
On these mental grounds – which today we prefer to call “noematic-cognitive” – we
would like to go into further depth as regards the lexigenetic processes of deverbaliza-
tion. And at this point, we suggest that the process of ‘deverbalization’, in the generic
or lexigenetic sense as such, cannot be located within words, but at the preverbal level,
within thought. Thought is verbal and preverbal at the same time, since every word is
always another word, which, logically, requires another thought, and it is precisely from
the cognitive – preverbal/verbal – pattern where in Spanish, for instance, the following
emerges:
a.	 firstly, ‘reverbal’ metaphorization or metonymization, of a postverbal nature:
a.1.“Las estrellas del cielo son 112 y las dos de tu cara, 114” [There are 112 stars
in the sky, plus two on your face, makes 114] – see Spanish zarzuela La Parranda,
Francisco Alonso (1928), according to José Prieto Marugán (2007) –: (your eyes are
the stars of your face); a.2. “Cervantes es una de las mejores plumas de las Letras
hispánicas” [Cervantes is one of the finest feathers in Spanish literature]: which
implies that “the feather as the writer’s instrument becomes the writer himselfâ•›â•›”;
b.	 or secondly, ‘transverbal’ transformation through the categorical Â�deverbalization
of a predicactantial linguistic pattern, of a postverbal nature, so that a ‘verb’
	 On deverbal word formation as condensation of previous mental patterns	 ïœ´ïœ²ïœ¹
becomes a ‘noun’ or an ‘adjective,’’ or vice versa: ‘casación’ < ‘casar’ [marriage
< to marry], ‘manipulación’ < ‘manipular’ [manipulation < to manipulate], etc.
or ‘chequeo’ > ‘chequear’ [check > to check], ‘pirata’ > ‘piratear’ [pirate > to
pirate], etc.
c.	 orlastly,‘preverbal’neologization,ofanon-verbalnature,endingintheÂ�creationofa
newsignifieror,moreexactly,anewword:“AciertasedadeshayqueÂ�alicamentarse”
[at a certain age we must fedicate ourselves]: (within the Â�
neologism alicamentarse
< French s’alicamenter, employed in some French advertisements towards the end
of the twentieth century, from where I took it. There are two underlying lexical
forms, French s’alimenter/Spanish alimentarse [to feed oneself] + French médica-
ment/Spanish medicamento [medication], which are Â�
amalgamated or fused in a
unique verb).
In a., in the ‘reverbal’ metaphorization or metonymization, of a postverbal nature,
we can identify a ‘word’ as a starting point for the metaphorization or metonymization
of the resulting scope of meaning. The result would be a ‘deverbal’ noun that, in its
relation to the ‘word/source’, transforms it by generalization, in the case of the ‘meta-
phorization’; or a ‘deverbal’ noun that, in its relation to the ‘word-source’, like the part
to the whole, the container to the content, the encompassing to the encompassed, etc.
transforms it by coalescing or participation, in the case of ‘metonymization’.
In b., in the ‘transverbal′ transformation through the deverbalization between
Â�
categories of a predicactantial linguistic pattern – of a postverbal nature – from an
existing signifier we transform one word into another, i.e. a ‘deverbal’ noun is obtained,
which can be seen in the transformation between the word/source and the word/goal
or resulting -cible: thus, a noun turns into an ‘adjective’ or a ‘verb’, or a ‘verb’ turns into
a ‘noun’ or an ‘adjective’, or an ‘adjective’ turns into a noun or a ‘verb’, etc. In the case
of the Spanish ‘labrador [farmer]’ the pattern of a predicactantial base [labrar [to farm]
(x, y) /x = ‘who works the land’, the farmer; and y = ‘the land that is cultivated’] is at
play, and in particular “x” is focussed. However, in the case of the Spanish ‘labrantío’
[farmland] the same predicactantial pattern is at play, but “y” is focussed.
In c., in the ‘preverbal’ neologization, of a non-verbal nature, ending in the Â�creation
of a new signifier or, more exactly, a new word, we can ignore that start-up word in
each and every one of the knots or phases of the transformation of the predicactantial
pattern, and we must apply, by analogy, starting points for unleashing the outcome of
the neologization.
But, in any case, the starting point of the ‘deverbal’ lexigenesis is not and cannot
be, might I add, ‘verbal’, even though in its development the speaker may encounter
‘verbal forms’, as an analogue to the cognitive starting point, cases a. and b., but the
process itself is purely cognitive, since it is intended to obtain new words, whether they
are purely ‘innovative’ or strictly ‘new’. The dominant process is cognitive in either case.
ïœ´ïœ³ïœ°	 Estanislao Ramón Trives
The echonyms, following the approaches of Bernard Pottier (2008:â•›
49–53), have
been created on the basis of the echo or exemplary discursive-textual memorization,
prior to the noematic-cognitive control, as a prerequisite. In fact, we understand the
noeme, contrary to Leonard Bloomfield ([1933] 1969:â•›
264), as the necessary tertium
comparationis for the control of linguistic and non-linguistic human behavior, Â�following
the approaches by Klaus Heger (1976), and also according to the more general Â�proposals
by Xavier Zubiri ([1980] 2006:â•›277):
Lo real en y por sí mismo es realidad aprehendida en aprehensión primordial, y
recíprocamente, la realidad como real no está actualizada más que en aprehensión
primordial. Pero no todo lo que está excluido de esta aprehensión primordial lo
está también de su intelección en el logos. Así, lo que llamamos mesa no es algo
actualizado en aprehensión primordial de realidad, porque lo real en cuanto tal
no es la mesa como mesa, sino como “cosa” con propiedades; y sólo es mesa en
función constructa con la realidad de mi vida. Yo no aprehendo mesas, pero tengo
un logos de las mesas, y en general de toda cosa-sentido. Es el enriquecimiento de
la realidad de mi vida como constructa con lo real. El logos no amplía la realidad,
pero constituye un enriquecimiento innegable de su contenido.
We have to deep into such a pulsating, somewhat utopian, matter, but, for the same
reason, we need to do it in exigent demand of our personal design, since the speaking
community with its uses remains a priority above each of the speakers, and also feeds
on the speaking or telling activity of each one.
4.â•… Language in constant evolution
Language is a systematic configuration of perceptions in solidarity with a neuro-
intellective configuration of internalized experiences which ensures or Â�
stabilizes the
customary inter-subjective behavior of the speakers that responds to an ever-changing
urgency, desire or need to say.
José Ortega y Gasset ([1934–1949] 1983:â•›233–258) was right to consider or Â�suggest
the primacy of saying above speaking(Obras completas, vol. VII, Alianza Â�
Editorial
1983:â•›233–258), when he proposes the need for a Linguistics of saying. And indeed, in
a way, man in his saying gambles, risks, while in speaking, he plays and, so to speak,
he amuses himself.
The comprehensive character of the verbal operation oscillates between saying
and speaking in a constant swing or evolution. That is why our languages change,
evolve and, in a word, live.
4.1â•… The lexematic complexity
As in a continued systole and diastole, language reflects situations of complex experi-
ential intensity, and it comes to lexematic processes of sufficient intensity to withstand
	 On deverbal word formation as condensation of previous mental patterns	 ïœ´ïœ³ïœ±
treaties such as De Ira, by Seneca, or semiotic studies such as the lexeme la colère [the
anger] within De la colère, by A. J. Greimas, in his Du Sens II, Seuil (1983:â•›225–246).
This gives an account of the complexity of a lexeme that condenses multiple modali-
ties between frustration and discontent, as reported, in line with the approaches of
Greimas, by I. Klock-France – J. Fontanille in “La colére: passion, péché, forme de
vie”, in their contribution to the work edited by Éric Landowski, Lire Greimas, Presses
Universitaires de Limoges 1997:â•›85–120, not to mention the lexèmes programmatiques,
in the terminology of Greimas, that condense the complexity of narrative programs of
various kinds.
4.1.1â•… The noematic-cognitive level of deverbal transformation
With deverbal transformation the speaker moves away from mere talking and towards
the originating attitude or situation of saying, in which he has something to say and
resorts to all that is available, in all his complexity of saying, which is noematic-cogni-
tive, i.e. noematic-preverbal, since it is immersed in verbal dynamics and necessary for
its full operation, as Klaus Heger quite rightly observed (1976); and, also, according
to each case, cognitive-preverbal, in so far as the assimilation of experiences presses on
the speaker and makes him produce a linguistic unit ex nihilo, without any verbal base.
4.1.1.1â•… The structural syntagmatic patterns required for the assimilation of experi-
ences which are condensed into words and noematically or mentally Â�controlled become
further subject to the willingness of saying at a given moment in the Â�
assimilation of
experiences, and undergo a process of deverbalization in two complementary lines:
a.	 In the perspective of the whole, the holistic perspective, which is essentially
Â�
synthetic, condensing, in order to obtain an extra verbal economy, able to say
more with less, given the agglutination of components of the linguistic outline
or verbal pattern into a single unit or word, which is what happens, for instance,
with deverbal tokens like the Spanish escritura [writing] or embarque Â�[boarding],
as regards the underlying analytical syntagmas required by the base of the
Â�
structural-syntagmatic patterns underlying the original Spanish verbs escribir
[to write]or embarcar [to embark].
b.	 The other line of deverbalization is the parcelling perspective, meristic Â�perspective,
with an awareness of its status, in so far as the whole, to which role focused on
the deverbal unit is a part, is implicit in the distinctive features or Â�
distinctive
Â�
components of the meaning underlying the deverbal unit. This is what Â�
happens
with the Spanish escritor/escribano/escribidor/escribiente [writer], etc., as we
analyze further, in 4.1.1.2.1.1. The meaning of these deverbal nouns Â�
maintains
the structural program of writing (escribir), implicit,while the Â�
equivalent of the
Spanish embarcar [boarding] remains in pure virtuality. The meristic Â�
perspective
intervenes in the Spanish deverbal noun escrito and also, mutatis mutandis,
in the Spanish deverbal noun escritorio [desk]. In contrast, the deverbal noun
ïœ´ïœ³ïœ²	 Estanislao Ramón Trives
for the Â�
purpose of EMBARCAR [boarding], (<{en+barco+infinitive’s suffix
of Â�dynamicity}), is in pure virtuality, but what does emerge is a deverbal noun
Â�
corresponding to its location, when we employ the Spanish embarcadero [pier].
4.1.1.1.1â•… In turn, the Spanish deverbal verb desembarcar [to disembark] also Â�generates
a small number of deverbal nouns, similar to the original embarcar, and we only note
the existence of the already mentioned deverbal holistic desembarco Â�[disembarkation],
included in constructions that can be found in newspaper Â�
headlines, such as the
Â�
construction cited in the Nueva Gramática de la Lengua Española, by the RAE (Real
Academia Española) 2009:â•›863, 12.11a: El desembarco de los aliados en Â�
Normandía el
día 6 de junio de 1944 (The disembarkation of the allies in Normandy on the 6th June
1944 ).
In this sentence, including the Spanish holistic deverbal noun desembarco, we
can see all the specific-central and generic-peripheral characteristics of the structural
Â�
complex dominated by the verbal base desembarcar. Indeed, the specific or actantial
role is represented by [aliados], with the characteristics belonging, in syncretism, to
unaccusative constructions. It can be seen, on the one hand, there is a reference made
to the dynamic complement or actant of the process, ‘in so far as the allies get out of the
vessel on their own foot’, and, on the other hand, it involves the complement or actant
affected by the process, ‘in so far as the allies are landed or brought from elsewhere to
Normandy.’
The semantic-relational syncretism of the unaccusativity of the verbal core,
Â�
desembarcar, in my opinion, affects the consideration of the specific or nuclear
Â�complementation [los aliados] and the generic peripheral complementation that we
can identify in [en Normandía]. This in turn is in syncretism between, on the one
hand, ‘the generic-relational encompassing frame’, in the sense that ‘the landing of the
allies took place in Normandy on 6 June 1944’, and, on the other hand, the telic-terminal
goal of the ‘transference process’, under which ‘the allies were taken, and, consequently,
arrived, in Normandy on 6 June 1944’.
Needless to say, in contrast, the ‘temporal frame factor’ or ‘timing’, [on 6 June
1944], is presented as a framework encompassing the process of disembarking as a
whole, and is a clear generic-temporal complement, applied to a time-measurable
Â�
process such as that contained in the Spanish desembarcar [to disembark] or in its
deverbalization, desembarco [disembarkation].
4.1.1.2â•… ThewealthofdeverbalnounsfromthecomponentsoftheÂ�underlyingÂ�structural
frame, which is found, for instance, in the Spanish escribir [to write], can contribute, in
my opinion, in a similar sense to Simon C. Dik (1968:â•›160), to strengthen the distinc-
tion between the systemic syntagmatics of hierarchically ordered features within each lin-
guistic unit, in order to virtually link to other complementary linguistic units, and the
	 On deverbal word formation as condensation of previous mental patterns	 ïœ´ïœ³ïœ³
syntagmatic performance of one linguistic unit in combination with other units virtually
linked in a sentence or text with the responsibility of saying or telling.
In fact, prior to the verbal or discourse operation, we must consider theÂ�precon-
dition of the syntagmatic components and, ultimately, reject the analyzes that are
practized within phrases or sentences ignoring the previous systematic structural
condition that justifies all the sentential display of systemic syntagmatics (SV). The
so-called SV, in our opinion, must be referred to in its linguistic comprehensiveness,
beyond the role acquired by its components as a result of the verbal operation, which,
in Spanish, for instance, among other languages, admits the binary combination or
syntagmatic contrast between subject and predicate. But, obviously, we cannot consider
this distinction equal to the simple SN/SV. Indeed, clearly, [SNsubject] is not equivalent
to /SN/ with all its virtuality, and, similarly, [SVpredicate] is not equivalent to /SV/ with
all its possibilities of specific and generic underlying complementation. All comple-
mentation of an SV belongs to the SV, prior to discourse arrangement between its
respective virtual units.
4.1.1.2.1â•… Let us reproduce what Louis Hjelmslev (1978:â•›80) tells us, quite rightly, in
my opinion, in relation to the distinction between system and discourse, which under-
lies our reflection in this paper:
Al determinar así el método que debe seguirse, no creemos que sea superfluo
prevenir un posible malentendido. El hecho de que el caso no pueda ser definido
mediante hechos sintácticos, es decir hechos que derivan de la lógica y de la
estilística (general y especial), no quiere decir que el caso no pueda ser definido
mediante las relaciones que existen en el interior del sintagma y que se reflejan
a través de los hechos morfológicos de la rección. El sintagma es una realidad
gramatical. El sintagma es un esquema de recciones sometido a las reglas de la
norma, vinculado al sistema de una lengua dada, y por ello mismo radicalmente
diferente de la noción general y extralingüística de la frase. (Bold is mine)
4.1.1.2.1.1â•… The integral combinatorial virtuality within the SV, from the perspective
of the deverbal units of a given VERB, is evident as a linguistic reality that cannot be
masked, but explained – without being seduced by the mere cumulative data that we
can see in the sequential union of segments which occurs in the linear Â�dimension of
verbal behavior – in the terms of Lucien Tesnière (1959). Instead, it should be Â�identified
in its coherent integrity, in its underlying convergence or intersection, i.e. taking into
account, also in terms of Tesnière, its structural dimension.
And precisely from that structural dimension, it is worth recalling the original
value of the syntagmatic relations contracted by the verb with regard to the other units
convened by it, in order to become part of a process – the verbal process – to which
nothing is alien in so much as it being a part of the structural underlying pattern.
ïœ´ïœ³ïœ´	 Estanislao Ramón Trives
In that sense, the argument or actant responsible for the process are equally
Â�
complementary to the verb, in our example of escribir [to write], it would be el Â�
escritor
[the writer] and the result of the process of writing, i.e. el escrito [the document]
and the process itself, escribir [towrite] and, of course, the framework encompassing
the location of the process of writing, i.e. escritorio [desk] in a kind of syntagmatic
Â�prototype such as ({ESCRIBIR (x, y)}z), that we can materialize in sentences such as
the following:
A. Cervantes escribió el Quijote en la cárcel. [Cervantes wrote el Quijote in prison].
A1. Cervantes fue el escritor del Quijote. [Cervantes was the writer of el Quijote].
A2. La escritura del Quijote por parte de Cervantes tuvo lugar en la cárcel.
[The writing of el Quijote by Cervantes took place in prison].
A3. El escritorio de Cervantes a la hora de escribir el Quijote fue la cárcel.
[Cervantes’ desk when writing el Quijote was a prison].
Obviously, the mere SUBJECT/PREDICATE dichotomy remains possible, without
any other distinction or consideration, but it may mask the integral Â�
relational
condition of the verb with respect to what turns out to be its subject in an Â�
operation
other than the merely syntagmatic operation, i.e. the phrasal or predicative
operation. This operation presupposes language, but does not annul it in any way,
despite the fact that, in verbal behavior, the previous polyadic syntagmatic unit
of the underlying SV is distributed in the resulting binary subject-predicate Â�linear
Â�
disposition, which as a logical-linear adherent does not annul the underlying
previous complementary or predicactantial complexity, in the precise multi-Â�relational
sense; but instead, it Â�
presupposes it.
Besides deverbal nouns, sometimes focused on the trigger entailed in the Â�
process,
sometimes focused on the outcome-object of the process, or sometimes on the
Â�beneficiary of the process or on the framework encompassing the whole of the Â�process,
we have to take into account the incontrovertible fact that in the subject-predicate
binary discursive division the various arguments of relational linguistic-syntagmatic
verbal complex can converge, where the trigger argument of the whole process or SV
may have the role of subject, and the framework can, for instance, operate as a subject
of the process as a whole, as we have seen in regard to the discursive possibilities of the
arguments or complements of SV surrounding the Spanish ESCRIBIR.
In conclusion, we can see how, by analogy with the lexigenesis of deverbal nouns,
all the nuclear or peripheral components of the relational complex surrounding a verb,
SV, can be extended to the procedures of the emphatic-divided constructions. In these
constructions, the speaker is to divide what in the underlying virtual linguistic chain is
integrated into a real “one by two” according to its etymology, hendiadyn (<έν+δία+δυς
≡ 1 x 2), in order to separate, highlight or target the component of greater prominence
from the rest, according to Albert Sechehaye (1950:â•›121), putting the component that
	 On deverbal word formation as condensation of previous mental patterns	 ïœ´ïœ³ïœµ
interests the speaker in discursive performance, within the relational complex entailed
in the linguistic system in its integrity.

Lexical collocations and the learning
of Spanish as a foreign language
State of the art and future projects

“La formación de palabras en español constituye, más que un
tema, un ámbito temático”1
(Almela 1999)
This chapter deals with the definition of collocation in books used for the
teaching of Spanish as a foreign language (SFL). Different definitions of this
concept are revised, and its characteristics are deeply discussed in order to
distinguish them from free combinations and compounds. Throughout history,
the semantic approach has prevailed over the statistic approach. On the one hand,
not every recurring combination forms a collocation, and only certain kinds of
combinations are considered collocations, as has been pointed out in the two
typologies proposed by Corpas (1996) and Koike (2001). On the other hand, the
idea of arbitrariness of collocations should be replaced by the concept of lexical
selection. This concept determines which lexical classes select predicates, as was
done in the Redes dictionary.

1.â•… Introduction
From a very broad perspective, which considers word formation to be a thematic field,
there is room for a reflection such as the one we are going to propose, which starts
with the phraseology and the context of teaching vocabulary to non-native speakers
and which attempts to base its proposals on perspectives of theoretical Linguistics and
Psycholinguistics.
The aim of this paper is, firstly, to summarize the different contributions of
Phraseology and Foreign Language Teaching (FLT) about collocations, pointing out
ïœ±.â•… [Word formation in Spanish constitutes, rather than a topic, a thematic field].
ïœ´ïœ´ïœ°	 Marta Higueras García
differences and similarities with free combinations and compounds. We would quickly
like to mention that we will be going over the various positions found and that, rather
than answers, we will pose questions, since there is quite little consensus regarding
the subject of collocations and the discipline that should approach them. Noting the
diverging points and those in common between different opinions, as well as defend-
ing their importance both in acquisition and in the teaching of vocabulary and deriv-
ing didactic consequences are also priority goals in this paper.
Lastly, after this state of the art, we aim to arouse curiosity and motivate future
teachers of SFL to continue investigating this topic. For this purpose, we will list new
lines of research which, from our point of view, should be approached in the near
future, both in lexicographic and didactic projects, before stating that collocations are
fully incorporated in SFL teaching.
2.â•… 
The controversial concept of collocation and its characteristics
Already a decade ago,2 Alonso Ramos (1994:â•›9) highlighted the polysemous character
of this term: in some works – mainly those didactically orientated, we might add –
it was used to discuss probable or usual combinations of two words; while in other
cases – in works on linguistics –, it is applied to constrained combinations in which
a Â�
lexeme, the base, required the presence of another, the collocative, like in exam-
ples such as actividad febril [frenetic activity], lucha encarnizada [fierce struggle] or
esfuerzo ímprobo [tremendous effort].
From the point of view of phraseology, an indisputable reference is the work by
Corpas (1996), inspired in the definition by Haensch et al. (1982:â•›251): “…entendemos
por colocación aquella propiedad de las lenguas por la que los hablantes tienden a
producir ciertas combinaciones de palabras entre una gran cantidad de combinaciones
teóricamente posibles”;3 Corpas broadens this definition as follows4 (1996:â•›66):
ïœ².â•… Even in the 80’s the term, which as we will see allows various interpretations, still had
a very limited use and was barely found outside the field of lexicography. However, in the
90’s it began to receive the attention of various studies, as we will see below. Nevertheless, it
is rare to find papers in Spanish applying this concept to the didactics of foreign languages
(Higueras 2004a). The term has begun to be stabilized as of 1992 with the works of Írsula
(1992); Â�
Aguilar-Amat (1993); Alonso Ramos (1993); Corpas (1996); Castillo (1998); Koike
(2001); Bosque (2001b) and Penadés (2001).
ïœ³.â•… […we understand by collocation the property of languages by which speakers tend to
produce certain combinations of words among a great number of theoretically possible
Â�combinations].
ïœ´.â•… [We also use collocation to refer to the resulting combinations,that is,to the phraseological
units formed by lexical units in a syntactic relation which, in themselves, do not constitute
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	 ïœ´ïœ´ïœ±
También denominaremos colocación a las combinaciones así resultantes, es
decir, a las unidades fraseológicas formadas por dos unidades léxicas en relación
sintáctica, que no constituyen por sí mismas, actos de habla ni enunciados; y
que, debido a su fijación en la norma, presentan restricciones de combinación
establecidas por el uso, generalmente de base semántica: el colocado autónomo
semánticamente (la base) no sólo determina la elección del colocativo, sino que,
además, selecciona en éste una acepción especial, frecuentemente de carácter
abstracto o figurativo.
We must thank Hausmann (1989:â•›1010) for the precision regarding the different status
between the two collocated words;5 according to this author, one of them determines
the selection of the other. Therefore, he distinguishes between the base, or the word
that determines which words it can combine with, and the collocative, which is the
determined element.
No less clarifying is the definition by Koike (2001:â•›
76) in his monograph on
Â�
lexical collocations, where he defines them as “a lexical-semantic link conditioned
by Â�
syntax”. This author points out three formal and three semantic characteristics.
Â�
Starting with formal characteristics, we come across frequent co-occurrence, which
is one of the most important ones, but it is not limited to collocations, nor does it
guarantee that a collocation exists. Sometimes one or various words appear inter-
spersed with Â�others, a concept which has been labeled “collocational span”.6 Secondly,
Â�
combination Â�
constraints: collocations are preferable or habitualized combinations
that present Â�
certain combination constraints, imposed through traditional use. It is
acts of speech or sentences; and which, due to their fixation in the norm, present combination
constraints established through use,generally of a semantic base: the semantically autonomous
collocated component (the base) not only determines the selection of the collocative, but also
selects a special nuance, often of an abstract or figurative character].
ïœµ.â•… For this author, the base is the noun in collocations of the noun + adjective, noun + verb
and verb + noun kind; it is the verb in the verb + adjective kind; in the case of adjective +
adverb, the base is the adjective; and in the noun + preposition + noun pattern, it is one of
the two nouns. The base is semantically autonomous, but the collocative is not (Hausmann
1979 and Alonso Ramos 2002a); thus, for example, in order for the adjective solo [alone] to
mean ‘sin leche’ [without milk] it must co-occur with café [coffee] and, for this reason, the
collocation is normally described in the entry of the base in works such as the Diccionario
combinatorio del español (DICE) where, starting from an entry such as error, the user can
find out how to intensify that word – see Alonso Ramos (2002b) and Sanromán (2003) –,
but not the Redes dictionary, which could be considered a dictionary of collocatives – see
Bosque (2001a); Bosque (2004) and Higueras (2004b) –.
ïœ¶.â•… The words considered are four before and four after. In order to discover the co-occurrence
of two lexical units A and B, we must calculate the frequency of A, the frequency of B, the
Â�
co-occurrence of A and B, and in what sense they are used. Koike (2001:â•›
27) believes that we
can talk of collocations when the percentage of co-occurrence of two lexical units is above 20%.
ïœ´ïœ´ïœ²	 Marta Higueras García
a case of lexical predilection, with a lower degree of fixation than idioms, since it
is Â�
possible to replace one of the two words from the collocation with a synonym:
superar/vencer/salvar una dificultad [to overcome/to cope with/to resolve Â�difficulties].
The last characteristic is formal compositionality. Collocations are compositional and
variable both Â�
combinationally and morphologically, which allows certain formal
Â�flexibilities: component substitution: violar/transgredir/vulnerar las normas [to break/
violate/Â�
disregard the rules]; adjective modification: daba una explicación satisfactoria
[he gave a satisfactory explanation]; pronominalization, nominalization: repicar la
campana and repique de campanas [to ring out bells and ringing of bells]; and Â�
passive
transformation: sea Â�
condonada la deuda [let the debt be cancelled]. Â�
Nevertheless,
Â�
collocations are not always compositional from a semantic point of view; some of
them, due to semantic specialization of one of its components, are not so easy to
interpret for someone unfamiliar with a given language and culture.
Next, Koike (2001:â•›
28–29) goes on to summarize the three semantic character-
istics. Firstly, he talks about the link between two lexemes, which could explain the
change in grammatical category that affects some collocations: luchar encarnizada-
mente; lucha encarnizada [to battle fiercely’, ‘a fierce battle]. Secondly, he mentions the
typicality of the relation: collocations express a typical relation between components,
and this is perhaps one of the novelties of Koike’s characterization. So, we can include
as collocations tocar la guitarra [to play the guitar]and rasguear la guitarra [to strum
the guitar] but not comprar una guitarra [to buy a guitar]or guardar la guitarra [to put
away a guitar], since the noun guitarra can only establish a typical relation as a musical
instrument. This typicality of the relation is normally present in the lexicographical
definition (and this may be the reason why collocation and “entourage” have occa-
sionally been mixed up). Lastly, Koike talks about semantic precision. As opposed to
idioms, collocations present, for this author, a semantic precision or an unmistakable
concept; especially those formed by noun-verb, which are used as definers, that is, they
define a simple lexical unit in senses found in entries of the dictionary: for example,
in one sense of rumorear [to rumour] we find the collocation circular un rumor [to
spread a rumour].
From a linguistic and phraseological perspective – we are not going to go into
the relation between both, the marginality of the latter and its recent boom thanks to
Â�cognitive linguistics (see Salvador 1995) –, works by other authors allow us to add other
characteristics: they are a psychological unit for the speakers of a language (Benson
et al. 1986), they are a case of lexical constraint in which there is directionality, since
one lexeme selects the other (Alonso Ramos 1994:â•›16); they present arbitrary fixation
in the norm, caused by repeated use (Hausman 1989; Corpas 1996: 53 and Zuluaga
2002: 106), and they are also characterized by syntactic regularity (Zuluaga 2002:â•›11)
and by being partially compositional, because the base conserves its meaning, but the
collocative adopts a special meaning which it only has in the presence of the other
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	 ïœ´ïœ´ïœ³
Â�
element (Corpas 1996; Castillo Carballo 1998 & Koike 2001). For some authors they
are a lexical unit (Lewis 1993; Corpas 1996; Bogaards 2001; Gómez Molina 2004 and
Higueras 1997), while for others it is a relation of meaning (McCarthy 1990 & Schmitt
2000), an aspect we will go on later.
3.â•… The continuum of idiomaticity and fixation
Despite the fact that the characteristics of collocations seemed to be clear in
Â�
phraseology, however, it is clear that works on the SLT field, such as those by Lewis
(1993 1997 2000) dealt with a much broader concept of collocations: their most
notable Â�
characteristics were institutionalization and frequency of co-apparition, but
not so much, lexical Â�
constraint and directionality or typicality, perhaps for numerical
reasons, since there are so few collocations that present all of these features. Conse-
quently, many of the examples used in books for learning foreign languages under
the label of collocations would not be considered so by most phraseologists. This
broad perspective of the concept of collocation – proposed by Hausmann (1989),
who claimed that whenever an idea is expressed with different lexemes in another
language it should appear in a collocations dictionary – is what allows us to state
that collocations are worked on in activities about topics, such as housework Â�
(limpiar
el polvo [to dust], hacer/estirar/arreglar las camas [to make/do/make up the bed],
planchar la ropa [to iron clothes], fregar los platos [to wash the dishes], etc.] or sports
or hobbies done in our spare time [montar a caballo [horse riding], jugar al tenis [to
play tennis], hacer senderismo [to go trekking], ir de compras [to go shopping], etc.].
In order to bring together both opinions and especially to list the kind of Â�
lexical
units which language teachers should pay attention to, we proposed (Higueras 2004a,
2006) a not discrete classification of lexical units (in line with the work of Ruiz Gurillo7
1998). In these papers we stated that free combinations, prototypical Â�
collocations
(described above) and those that do not fulfill each and every characteristic (which we
will call non-prototypical collocations8 or syntagmatic combinations) form a blurred
group, with intersections, common areas and intermediate categories. In spite of the
fact that prototypical collocations have been the most studied in phraseology, we hold
ïœ·.â•… Ruiz Gurillo (1997; 1998) has also talked about a continuum in which collocations would
take up an intermediate position between idioms, on one hand, and simply frequent or free
combinations, on the other. She defines them as units with a certain degree of fixation, that do
not present idiomaticity and that are subject to regular formation processes.
ïœ¸.â•… These only present arbitrary fixation in the norm, syntactic regularity, semantic
Â�
transparency, co-apparition frequency and institutionalization; while free combinations have
syntactic regularity and semantic transparency.
ïœ´ïœ´ïœ´	 Marta Higueras García
that there are more non-prototypical ones and they can be more useful for the learner
of a foreign language, since they are usually composed of frequent words and might
not correspond to the same lexemes when the student translates them to his or her
language.
We cannot refrain from mentioning the great number of papers published with
the aim of distinguishing collocations from free combinations, compounds (lexical
and syntagmatic) and from idioms (González Rey 1998; Martínez 2000; Ruiz Gurillo
2001; Higueras 2004). In this continuum of idiomaticity and fixation formed by phra-
seological units, collocations would take up the intermediate position between idioms,
on the one hand, and free combinations or of simply frequent words, on the other.9
The consequence of adopting a not discrete view of these phenomena is that the con-
cepts cannot be clearly defined in absolute terms, but rather through the intersection
of properties that tend to coincide statistically or probabilistically; that is, they are
conceived as parts of a continuum, because linguistic categories are complex (char-
acterized by more than one property or feature) and asymmetrical (each unit from a
group should not be defined by all the properties or features, but only some of them);
therefore, it does not make sense to think that all idioms, for example, share the same
features, as pointed out by Ruiz Gurillo (1997:â•›71), just as collocations appear not to.
It is not always easy to distinguish collocations from free combinations of
words, a fact that is not at all trivial, which poses one of the main difficulties that
lexicographers have to find an answer to. For that reason, we turn to the example
proposed by McCarthy (1990), in which he points out the significant differences we
can find between the following examples: hablar de deporte [to talk about sport],
del trabajo [about work], de los precios [about prices]… as opposed to hablar de
negocios [to talk business]. In the first group we are looking at free combinations of
the verb hablar [to talk] with different prepositional objects that refer to the huge
number of subjects human beings can talk about. However, the second example has
a different character: its meaning is transparent, but it refers to a state of affairs that
does not merely refer to talking, but to ‘starting a commercial relation, suggesting
an idea to do business’, etc. We are looking at a collocation because it is transpar-
ent and, Â�
furthermore, it is the formula any native speaker would use in that specific
Â�
situation we have just described: to propose an idea, to make an offer…, therefore, it
is a Â�
lexicalized and frequent unit.
ïœ¹.â•… Zuluaga (2002: 98) compares collocations with the dawn, free combinations with the day
and phraseological units with the night and states that although it is true that we cannot
Â�
establish rigid boundaries between day and night and less so between the dawn and the night,
that does not mean we cannot have a clear concept, or precise intuition, of what day, night
and dawn are.
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	 ïœ´ïœ´ïœµ
Koike (2001:â•›30) also provides some criteria to distinguish collocations from free
combinations: the latter are not produced with a stable frequency of co-occurrence,
since they are subject to the speaker’s choice; they have a lower degree of combina-
tion constraints (that is, collocations have constraints imposed by linguistic tradition
but free combinations do not); they have greater combinatory, morphological and
Â�
syntactic flexibility than collocations; they do not express a typical relation and, lastly,
collocations are easy to memorize and are psychologically salient, as opposed to free
combinations.
On the other hand, in our opinion, it is important to distinguish collocations
from compounds10 and idioms. We will only briefly mention the distinction from
compounds – due to restrictions of space –. The first thing we note is the different clas-
sification made of these elements in the Gramática descriptiva del español (Bosque &
Demonte 1999) and in the NGLE (Real Academia Española 2009). A decade ago, that
work divided them into: prototypical lexical Â�compounds and syntagmatic compounds.
According to Val, the former are a concatenation of two words to build a new lexical
unit, as in pelirrojo [redhead], and the latter are atypical compounds or syntagmatic
compounds, in which there is a reinterpretation of a syntactic construction, forming a
new lexical unit, characterized by its lack of compositionality (see also Bustos Gisbert
1986:â•›69–177): ojo de buey [porthole], tocino de cielo [sweet made with egg yolk and
sugar], oro negro11 [black gold].
Nevertheless, the grammar of the RAE divides compounds in three groups: proper
or univerbal compounds (agridulce [sweet and sour]); syntagmatic compounds,
formed through juxtaposition of words that preserve their graphic and accentual
independence, with or without a hyphen (árabe-isrealí [Arab-Israeli], teórico-práctico
[theorical-practical], problema clave [key problem], decreto ley [order in council]), and
syntactic compounds or nominal idioms, which are interpreted as lexical pieces, not
as morphological units: ojo de buey, mesa redonda [round table], media naranja [bet-
ter half]. This discrepancy in nomenclature proves that the subject requires further
consideration, that it should be approached in the future from different points of view.
The characteristics compounds and collocations have in common – bearing
in mind that neither of these groups is homogenous and, therefore, we can always
find exceptions – would be the following: they are a stable combination of lexemes,
which we can find isolated in other contexts outside that combination (Piera & Varela
1999:â•›
4371); they are learned as a whole and are shared by a community, that is,
they are not produced but reproduced (what Coseriu labelled “repeated discourse”)
ïœ±ïœ°.â•… The interesting paper by Alonso Ramos (2008) shows an in depth insight into the subject.
ïœ±ïœ±.â•… These examples are interpreted by Corpas as nominal idioms and this interpretation
Â�
prevails in the Nueva gramática by the RAE.
ïœ´ïœ´ïœ¶	 Marta Higueras García
Â�(Ferrando 2002); they belong to certain diastratic and diaphasic variants (compounds:
matasanos [derogatory term for doctor], picapleitos [derogatory term for lawyer] and
collocations: pillar un catarro, coger un catarro [to catch/get a cold]); they are formed
by the lexical categories that constitute the open classes of words (N, V, Adj., Adv.,
and Prep.) (Piera & Varela 1999:â•›
4371); there is a syntactical relation between the
two lexemes; they share structures12 and, lastly, they allow rhetorical figures, such as
metaphors or metonymy (compounds: hombre rana [frogman], ciudad dormitorio
[dormitory town] and collocations: profundo dolor [terrible pain], profunda aversion
[deep aversion]…).
The main difference between compounds and collocations is that only the former
are equivalent to a grammatical category,13 while collocations are closer to phrases. As
regards semantic aspects, both lexical compounds and collocations are compositional:
therefore, the cases in which they can be mistaken are those in which the former do
not have sufficient cohesion to be written in one word. Val (1999:â•›
4760) studies the
characteristics of prototypical lexical compounds in depth (see also Bustos Gisbert
1986) and we now compare them with collocations in order to find further differences:
they present a phonological amalgam of their components with a single main accent
in the second component, and they have morphological unity of the whole. There are
also other differences (Higueras 1997:â•›40–41): they behave differently when faced with
variation of gender and number; in order to form the plural of a collocation, both
words must be in the plural: chica morena/*chicas morena/*chica morenas [brown-
haired girl]. However, as it has been pointed out in different grammars of Spanish, in
the formation of the plural of noun compounds the degree of cohesion reached by the
components is relevant. When these elements have a high cohesion, they do allow the
plural, and form it with the last component; if their cohesion is not complete, either
the first or both components form it, hence the coexistence of: guardias civiles and
guardiaciviles [civil guards]. As regards gender, in collocations where there are nouns
and adjectives they must all agree in gender, while in compounds one can be feminine
and the other masculine, since what matters is the gender of the resulting compound:
la chica morena/*la chica moreno as opposed to: coche (m.) + cama (f.) → el coche cama
[sleeping car]. Also, as pointed out by Hernanz and Brucart (1987:â•›157), the second
ïœ±ïœ².â•… Lexical compounds can be: nominal (N+N; V+N; V+V; V+Adv.; Adj.+N; N+Adj.);
Â�
adjectival (Adj.+Adj.; N+Adj.); and verbal (N+V; Adv.+V). Sytagmatic compounds, according
toVal,can be of various kinds: with a prepositional phrase (N+Prep.); nominal phrase (N+Adj.
or Adj.+N); verbal phrase (VP+N); adjectives (Adj.+Adv.) and other types.Regarding the type
of collocations, the classifications of Corpas and Koike are explained further on.
ïœ±ïœ³.â•… Nominal compounds are equivalent to nouns (sacacorchos [corkscrew], bonobús [bus
pass], telaraña [cobweb]); adjectival compounds equal adjectives (labiodental [labiodental],
sadomasoquista [sadomasochist], and verbal compounds are equivalent to verbs (malcriar [to
spoil], fotograbar [to photoengrave].
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	ïœ´ïœ´ïœ·
nominal element of a compound cannot be modified by a specifying element or a
complement of its own: *coche cama comodísima [comfortable sleeping car], *pez dos
espadas [two *swordsfish].
An even more complex subject is distinguishing collocations from syntagmatic
compounds (in Val’s proposal, or syntactical compounds in the NGLE). Ferrando
(2002:â•›
100) also finds a series of differences regarding fixation: compounds present
greater fixation and stability (collocations allow variations) and the way of meaning.
On the one hand, compounds are more idiomatic (we find they have an unpredictable,
added meaning, but in collocations the base preserves its meaning and the collocative
presents a specialized meaning) and, furthermore, compounds play a denominational
or designational role: syntagmatic compounds are equivalent to a single concept (oso
hormiguero[anteater]),theyrefertoasinglereality,theyactasasingleunitofmeaning; this
does not occur with collocations. This author also underlines three other differences: in
collocations, one element selects the other; if we have the lexeme odio [hate] and we
wish to intensify it, there is the adjective mortal [mortal]; if we start with the noun miedo
[fear], we would probably choose atroz [terrible], while in the elements of a compound
there is no selection constraint; in the case of the adjective, they differ in the manner of
meaning: in N + Adj. collocations, the adjective has an intensifying function (voluntad
férrea [strong will], frío glacial [ice cold], in the Â�
syntagmatic compound it specifies (león
marino [sea lion], barco pesquero [fishing boat], avión comercial [commercial plane]).
Lastly, in collocations there is no obligatory co-presence of its components, sometimes
one component can be replaced by a synonym (hambre canina/voraz [great/extreme
hunger]), but in compounds this is not always the case (caja fuerte, pero no *caja robusta
[safe] but not *[robust box], centro comercial pero no *núcleo comercial ([shopping
centre] but not *[commercial nucleus]).
The conclusions reached by Ferrando (2002:â•›
106) are that collocations and
Â�
syntagmatic compounds are adjacent phenomena, and that the difference between
them is a matter of degree, since compounds present greater fixation and idiomaticity.
Thanks to use, a free phrase can become a collocation and this, in turn, can become a
syntagmatic compound.
We cannot consider the debate to be over, but we can observe that the NGLE
incorporates syntagmatic compounds within idioms, as was also proposed by
Â�
Ferrando, when he stated that they must be studied from phraseology, given that they
are halfway between idioms and collocations, which are also included in the Â�
content
of this discipline. From a didactic point of view, what we have looked at in this Â�
section
is a minor problem that phraseology or lexicology should solve, since neither Â�
foreign
language teachers nor students require this metalanguage; they need only learn
to separate blocks of words or lexical units that have a unitary meaning and can be
Â�
contrasted with other lexical units in their mother tongues. This is the strategy that
Lewis (1993) labelled “pedagogical chunking” and is one of the main principles of the
Lexical Approach for FLT.

4.â•… Brief historical revision
There is no doubt that collocations are an enormously controversial phenomenon –
and therefore, interesting – which have been studied from different perspectives and
with various objectives that we will try to classify in this section, aiming to derive from
this historical revision some didactic implications for their teaching.
4.1â•… 
Statistical approach versus semantic approach
Corpas (2001:â•›49) speaks of two basic approaches in collocation studies: statistical and
semantic.14 The first was born in neo-Firthian surroundings when collocation was
identified with combination, so that Sinclair (1991:â•›70) understood by Â�collocation: “the
co-occurrence of two or more words that are found in a short length of text”. Although
his works have provided a very important methodology of study (because they used
objective criteria),15 they were severely criticized due to their limitations derived from
the direct application of statistics.
The semantic trend, however, starts off with combinations, but applies another
series of criteria to identify collocations, and allows us to see two aspects. On the one
hand, we find authors that hold that the base (the semantically independent element)
selects its collocative (the element whose meaning is restricted by the base). This Â�theory
refers to the works by Hausmann, and has had a huge influence on lexicography and
phraseology (Corpas, Alonso Ramos, Zuluaga, Koike, etc.). Collocations, therefore,
present internal semantic links of various kinds: specialization and delexicalization
or metaphorization of collocated elements; and they reflect a typical and true rela-
tion held between these elements in the real world which provide semantic precision
ïœ±ïœ´.â•… However, González Rey (2002:â•›
157–164) divides the consolidation of the concept of
Â�
collocation within the language in general in three phases:broad conception of the concept,typical
in the combinatorial method of English, since for its followers a collocation is any phrase formed
by two or more words that co-appear with certain frequency in discourse (for authors such as
Cowie (1981), Benson (1989) and Sinclair (1991)). These works were reproduced in dictionaries
containing multilexical constructions of the English language, aimed specifically at learners of
that Â�
language. The limited conception of this term corresponds to the combinatorial method of
French and is defined by Melčuk, and is also the position adopted by the German-French author
Â�
Hausmann, who, as we have already mentioned, created a theory applicable to Â�
lexicography,
Â�
didactics and translation. In Spanish combinatory, the tradition of Hausmann has been Â�
inherited
and Â�
reinterpreted through Corpas,so it follows that limited conception of the term.
ïœ±ïœµ.â•… The aim of his studies was to create dictionaries based on textual corpora and
they Â�
culminated in the publication in 1987 of the Collins COBUILD English Language
Â�Dictionary.
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	ïœ´ïœ´ïœ¹
(that is, collocations express an unequivocal concept for native speakers in a quick
and Â�
economical way). Also within this line are the works by Alonso Ramos (1993) on
lexical functions in the Meaning-Text Theory, that list the internal semantic links of
collocations. On the other hand, there are the works by Bosque, who talks of lexical
selection of predicates towards their arguments, as we will see below.
This dichotomy between the statistical approach and the semantic approach
has been resolved clearly in favour of the latter. Proof of the fact that not any
Â�
recurring Â�
combination forms a collocation is that there is a closed typology of lexical
Â�
collocations. We will now go on to revise the classifications of Corpas and Koike to
emphasize this idea.
Corpas’ classification (1996:â•›
66–76) from her Manual de fraseología takes into
account different criteria: grammatical category, syntactic relation between Â�
collocated
elements and lexical functions of the Meaning-Text Theory (see Alonso Ramos
1993). According to the first two criteria mentioned, she distinguishes six types of
collocations16
ïœ±ïœ¶.â•… Some specifications on the different types:
a.â•…
Noun (subject) + verb. In this kind of collocation the verb denotes an action typical of the
person or thing designated by the noun.
b.â•…
Verb + noun (object). The verbs in these collocations lead to three groups: collocations
that share collocatives and a base belonging to the same semantic field (desempeñar un
cargo/ un papel/ una función… [to carry out a job/a role/ a function]; collocations whose
bases present a very limited combinatorial pattern (conciliar el sueño/*atraer el sueño
[to get to sleep/to attract sleep]; acariciar una idea/*tocar una idea [to caress an idea/*to
touch an idea])…; and intermediate cases in which there is a delexicalized verb (normally
Â�
polysemous verbs such as dar [give], tomar [take], hacer [do/make] or poner [put], which
carries out rather auxiliary functions and a generally deverbal noun, which provides an
essential semantic load.
c.â•…
Adjective + noun. The adjective is the collocative in these collocations: fuente Â�fidedigna
Â�[reliable source]; importancia capital [prime importance]; relación estrecha [close
Â�relationship]; error garrafal [terrible mistake]… From a semantic point of view, these
Â�
collocations are characterized by the fact that the adjective normally intensifies the base,
in a positive or negative sense, on a given scale.
d.â•…
Noun + preposition + noun. This kind of collocations indicates either the unit within
which there is a smaller entity or the group an individual belongs to. The first noun is the
collocative, while the second is the base.
e.â•…
Verb + adverb. Adverbs that belong to this type of collocations are adverbs of mode and
intensity.
f.â•…
Adjective + adverb. This group includes collocations that contain a participle, acting as an
adjective, followed by an adverb, which is also normally of mode or intensity.

Secondly, we will take a look at Koike’s classification (2001), since he introduces
the novelty of distinguishing between collocations of simple lexical units and complex
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	 ïœ´ïœµïœ±
collocations, as shown in Figure 2; the latter are formed by adding a lexical unit to
another phraseological unit. As regards simple collocations, he suggests reducing the
six types of collocations of Corpas to five, because he believes that the first two can be
grouped into one – noun + verb –, but with three subgroups: noun (subject) + verb;
verb + noun (direct object), and verb + preposition + noun. However, he adds a group
composed of verb + adjective (for example, salir indemne, resultar ileso [to come off
unscathed]), which means his proposal also contains six types.
4.2â•… 
Arbitrariness versus lexical selection
Towards the end of the 80’s the work by Benson (1989:â•›
3) provides an insight into
the arbitrariness of collocations when he reflects on the structure of a dictionary of
Â�
collocations, since then, the lexicographers, similarly to foreign language teachers,
cannot lose sight of what the real needs of the users of that dictionary are.
Thus, we can say that collocations should be defined not just as ‘recurrent word
combinations’, but as ‘arbitrary recurrent word combinations’. Hausmann assigns
collocations to langue, i. e. the very system of the language. The arbitrary (as
opposed to free) nature of collocations can be demonstrated when they are
juxtaposed with corresponding collocations in other languages
 (Benson 1985:â•›11). (…)
The arbitrary nature of collocations can be easily demonstrated within English
itself. One says make an estimate – but not *make an estimation; make an effort –
but not *make an exertion; commit treason – but not *commit a treachery…
That same year, and also from a lexicographic perspective, Hausmann (1989:â•›1010 and
sections) dwells on the usefulness and need of a dictionary of collocations and insists
on their arbitrariness, as would later be done by Corpas (1996), Zuluaga (2002) and
Ferrando (1996).
C’est que l’idiosyncrasie de la collocation ne se rélève définitivement que dans
l’optique d’une autre langue qui combine, pour exprimer le même fait, des
mots diffèrents. On peut supposer qu’il suffit de contraster la combinaison
avec celle, correspondante, de l’ensemble des langues de la terre, pour que
n’importe quelle combinaison libre se transforme en collocation. Vu cet état de
choses, on a intérêt à favoriser les solutions pragmatiques, à essayer de prendre
en compte certaines grandes langues de comparaison, à éviter des cas trop
évidents du genre valise rouge et à se résigner à ne pas être exhaustif dans la
périphérie.
Nevertheless, Bosque’s proposal and the publication of the Redes dictionary have
shown that combinations of lexemes, which lead to collocations, are not arbitrary and
they have been defined, described and classified in this lexicographic work.
ïœ´ïœµïœ²	 Marta Higueras García
Redes is not, strictly speaking, a dictionary of collocations, since it does not focus
on this unit,17 but on lexical and/or semantic constraints that are found in the Â�
relations
between predicates and arguments (Bosque 2004). For this author, as mentioned earlier
(Bosque 2001b), collocations are a particular phenomenon of frequent co-apparitions
and lexical selection, a broader notion that can be used to explain this and other phe-
nomena of language. This vision of this linguistic phenomenon is very original, since it
inverts the direction of the selection; that is, it suggests that it is the predicate that selects
arguments and not the base that determines the collocative,18 as was thought until then.
Redes turns collocatives into entry-heads, so, for example, an adverb like tajante-
mente [outright] would be the entry-head and we might say it would be predicated in
verbs like rechazar [to reject], oponerse [to oppose], cerrar [to close], zanjar [to settle],
separar [to separate], etc.; that is, in each case, a group of words is given with which to
combine the entry-head (which is always a predicate or selective element: N, V, Adj.,
Adv., Prep.), grouped in lexical classes (Bosque 2001a: 32). This work offers informa-
tion that native Spanish speakers know as users of the language, but that does not
appear in any other dictionary.
Therefore, Bosque understands that collocatives constitute predicates, and bases
become their arguments; the combinatory dictionary directed by this author, Redes,
studies, for example, entries such as enérgicamente [strongly], because the semantic
classes19 this predicate forms can be characterized, but it does not study adverbs like
lentamente [slowly], since they are applied to an excessively wide group of verbs.20
ïœ±ïœ·.â•… As regards collocations, it does not consider them part of phraseology and recommends
great care with the criteria of frequency, since they often offer information on the world and
not on language (Bosque 2001b: 25–28). Regarding the criteria of preference, he also recom-
mends caution, since often the most frequent collocation is interpreted as the only one, for
example we speak of desear ardientement [to desperately desire], but it is no less true that we
can apply this adverb to other verbs such as: anhelar [to long for], defender [to defend], crear
[to create], vivir [to live], amar [to love], besar [to kiss], etc. Lastly, it is also possible that many
of the preferable combinations are expressions of common places, favoured by the habits and
beliefs of a community (love is fire/passion, etc.). The Nueva Gramática de la Lengua Española
(2009:â•›57) insists that lexical pieces are of interest to morphology and phraseology, and that
lexicology should be the one in charge of collocations.
ïœ±ïœ¸.â•… This idea that collocatives select a series of bases was already proposed in the concept of
collocational field by Hausmann (1989), and Corpas also mentioned that instead of talking
about pairs such as “collocative-base”, there were paradigms formed by related elements
(prestar ayuda/ atención/ asistencia/ colaboración…[to lend a hand]).
ïœ±ïœ¹.â•… Some examples of lexical classes would be: verbs of movement, of influence, of affection,
of perception, of prepositional attitude, etc. Given that lexical classes are frequently repeated,
Redes is full of cross references. Bosque (2001a).
ïœ²ïœ°.â•… It also does not include all nouns, verbs, idioms, etc. but only those that restrict their
arguments according to semantic criteria.
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	 ïœ´ïœµïœ³
In the following section we illustrate this opposition between arbitrariness and
lexical selection, with two compared examples: on the one hand, a quote from Zuluaga
and, on the other, the entry of the verb cometer [to commit], from the Redes dictionary,
summarized in Figure 3.
4.3â•… Didactic implications
As we can see in the entry in Redes, the lexical classes that can go with this verb have
been described, proving that it is not a case of arbitrary combinations but that the
lexical meaning of that verb selects certain lexical classes, since in the very definition
of the verb21 we can already infer that the actions committed are considered negative,
which rules out combinations such as *cometer un acierto [*’to commit success]. It is
possible that in another language this meaning may be included in a single lexeme
or there may be different verbs for committing positive actions and negative actions.
Therefore, the first implication for SFL teachers is the need to become familiar with
combinatory dictionaries which help understand this linguistic phenomenon.
This theoretical progress, which has shed its light on Spanish lexicography,
has still not had the repercussion it deserves in FLT, and our aim in this article is
to Â�
highlight this fact, since methodological changes for the teaching of collocation
should be derived in the short-term. On the other hand, most of the definitions given
by experts in vocabulary teaching of English as a Second Language (Gairns & Red-
man 1986; McCarthy 1990; Nation 1990, 2001; and Lewis 1993 1997 2000) and also
by us in works prior to the publication of Redes, have defined collocations as the fre-
quent co-apparition of two words and have insisted on their arbitrary nature. A second
didactic implication, as pointed out by Walker (2008:â•›
307), would be that once the
supposed arbitrariness of collocations is questioned, activities on collocations should
be designed in a way that would help the student to discover why a word is combined
with another.
Thirdly, perhaps another important didactic implication as regards teaching
vocabulary is including word combinatory when explaining new vocabulary in the
classroom; that is, providing the lexical classes that select a given word. Years of use of
synonyms as the main form of presentation or explanation of unknown Â�
vocabulary,
probably influenced by the importance of synonymic definitions in dictionaries,
could be leading students away from the natural course of learning vocabulary, which
ïœ²ïœ±.â•… The first sense of the word in the DRAE says: 1. tr.“Caer, incurrir en culpa, yerro, falta,
etc.” [To become guilty, make a mistake or fault]. As we can see, it does not indicate what can
be “committed” in Spanish.
ïœ´ïœµïœ´	 Marta Higueras García
Â�
probably implies the comprehension of the extension22 of each predicate, that is, the
entities to which it can be applied.
Foreign language teachers should always explain lexical units from their
combinatory,23 because knowing how a word combines is one of the dimensions
of what knowing a word implies, and it is a vital piece of information – although
not the only one – for the correct use of words in the syntagmatic axis (Higueras
2006a).
A teacher aware of the progress in psycholinguistics, who knows that words are
stored in our lexicon creating networks with very diverse relations, and who expects
his students to easily acquire this new vocabulary,24 should attempt an explanation
that could help create networks between words, insisting on combinatory, that is, the
lexical classes that each predicate selects, as is shown in the analytical entries in Redes.
ïœ²ïœ².â•… Redes is an onomasiological dictionary, that helps us codify, and therefore also takes
charge, in a rigorous way, of the outlines (“entourage”) of words, and tries to describe the
extension of the concepts (the entities to which they can be applied), as opposed to other
Â�
dictionaries that focus solely on intensional information (the series of properties that
Â�
distinguish it from other concepts). Thanks to the direction P > A (from the predicate to
the arguments), Redes allows us to adequately relate the intension of the concepts with their
Â�extension.The extensional information is provided by the lists of examples and the Â�
intensional
information, by lexical classes. (Bosque 2004: LXXXVIII and sections).
ïœ²ïœ³.â•… Over the last three decades a considerable number of combinatory dictionaries have
been published for English and French (in Higueras 2004b, a revision of these works
can be consulted), to which we can add the two titanic projects on the combinatory of
Spanish: the DICE and Redes. These are two complementary approaches: for Alonso Ramos
(2002a: 70) collocations are a codification phenomenon, hence the fact that she holds that
Â�
collocations should be treated in the lexicographical entry of the base (as is done in the
Dictionnaire Â�
explicatif et combinataire du français contemporain, DEC, and the Diccionario
de Â�
colocaciones del español, DICE: starting from an entry like error [error] the user can try
to find out how to intensify that word). From a decoding perspective, however, the only
way to rigorously deal with collocatives is that adopted by Bosque in Redes. In Redes, both
plantear [to pose] and problema [problem] are entry-heads, while in the DICE only key
words are defined (in the case of the collocation plantear un problema [to pose a problem]
only problema appeared); to us it seems logical that a foreign student should need to know
the combinatory capacity of the two words and not just of one of them. In the Práctico
Â�
dictionary (Bosque 2006) both of them appear as entry-heads.
ïœ²ïœ´.â•… Recent studies on psycholinguistics make it possible to state that lexical acquisition is
not only a sum of words that the student memorizes and stores one after another, but is a
qualitative, gradual, multidimensional, progressive and dynamic process, where the learner
weaves a complex network of relations – phonetic, graphic, semantic, morphological, syntac-
tical, encyclopedic or personal – between lexical units, which associates and fixes new infor-
mation with what he or she already knows.This intelligent storing of lexical units in which our
lexical competence lies is what we know as lexicon.

Traditional explanation Explanation bearing in mind the combinatory
of words
Cometer is to carry out, for example
cometer un error [to make a mistake]
Cometer is a verb meaning to carry out acts
that are considered negative and can be
combined with the following word classes:
Nouns denoting errors: error, fallo, equivocación,
lapsus…
Nouns denoting irregularity: irregularidad,
imperfección
Nouns denoting senseless, imprudent, foolish
or careless acts: locura, disparate, barbaridad,
tontería, estupidez…
Nouns denoting results of breaking laws or rules:
falta, crimen, infracción, robo, asesinato…
Figure 3.â•‡ Two explanations of the verb cometer
This explanation, without doubt, contrasts with the explanation given by Zuluaga,
that insists on arbitrariness:25
La fijación que presentan las colocaciones está basada en el uso repetido y es
arbitraria, no existe ninguna regla semántica que explique por qué decimos
cometer un error en lugar de hacer un error. En cometer un error se realizan
tanto el sistema como la norma, sin embargo, en hacer un error, sólo se realiza
el sistema, es una combinación posible según las reglas del sistema, pero no está
ratificada por la comunidad de hablantes, luego no se actualiza en la norma.
 (Zuluaga 2002:â•›106)
Fourthly, we should be sensitive to the need to relate physical meanings of words with
figured meanings, thus offering an integrating and non-accumulative approach to
vocabulary. As explained by Bosque (2003:â•›
23), predicates from column A have an
entry in the Redes dictionary, and their physical uses (column B) are briefly explained,
since they refer to extralinguistic (designational) information and the reader can add
words to that list without knowledge of the language; however, Redes carefully studies
column C, because we must have a knowledge of the language in order to complete
it and understand it. Nevertheless, the elements in this column can be classified, as
shown in the analytical entries.
ïœ²ïœµ.â•… [The fixation presented by collocations is based on repeated use and it is arbitrary, there is
no semantic rule to explain why we can say cometer un error instead of hacer un error.In cometer
un error both the system and the norm are followed, however, in hacer un error, only the system
is carried out,it is a possible combination according to the system,but it is not confirmed by the
speaking community, meaning the norm is not actualized] (Zuluaga 2002:â•›106).

Collocations in the acquisition and learning of vocabulary
Some powerful reasons to insist on teaching collocations when it comes to teaching
vocabulary in a foreign language could be those mentioned below.
The collocational aspect is vital in the process of language acquisition, since the
lack of knowledge of combinatory constraints on words in a language separates the
productions of a native speaker from those of a non-native speaker. Castillo Carballo
(2001) even goes further as to state that collocations are more complicated than Â�idioms
themselves, since the latter can be substituted by a free combination of words that
expresses the same idea, but this operation is not possible with collocations, given the
semantic precision that characterizes them. Through collocations we can determine
the degree of knowledge the speaker possesses and, therefore, their teaching should
not be limited to intermediate and high levels, but should be approached from the
beginning of the process of learning a language.
Precisely because collocations are transparent and composed of familiar words,
they go by unnoticed by the student.26 If we draw the student’s attention to this
Â�
phenomenon, we are training him or her in the strategy of segmenting the input
in units of meaning bigger than words, and making it easier for later incidental or
unplanned learning of collocations. This way, we are paying attention to both types of
learning, direct and incidental.
Furthermore, collocations are a principle that helps to organize and store
Â�
vocabulary in the lexicon. Aitchison (1987:â•›
74–85) proved, through experiments
Â�
consisting in asking a series of informers to say the first word that sprang to their
minds when presented with a given lexical unit, that there are certain vocabulary
ïœ²ïœ¶.â•… Hausmann(1989: 2013) underlines this fact: collocations are understood by learners, but
they cannot reproduce them automatically, since they are in a way unpredictable and, there-
fore, they have to learn them: “Il doit l’apprendre, parce que les langues, dans la totalité des
combinasions logiquement possibles, font un choix idiosyncratique. La collocation est une
unité, non de la parole, mais de la langue”.
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	 ïœ´ïœµïœ·
structuring principles, or different types of relations between lexical units, which she
listed according to the order of frequency: coordination, collocations, superordination
and, lastly, synonyms.
On the other hand, teaching multiverb complex lexical units consists in applying
the idiom principle27 (Sinclair 1991), and accepting that not every time we speak do
we creatively construct our sentences word by word, but that we also resort to more
complex segments that we have memorized, including collocations. In this sense, in
the teaching of second languages it is used the term “lexical units”, more from a point
of view of storage units than from a linguistic perspective.28 Following this proposal
we found the definition by Gómez Molina (2004:â•›497) of lexical unit:29 “…la unidad de
significado en el lexicón mental, que sirve como elemento vehiculador de la cultura del
español y puede estar formada por una o más palabras (cabeza, paraguas, dinero negro,
a la chita callando, tomar el pelo, no hay más cera que la que arde, etc.)”. The proposal
we have made in specialized publications on didactics follows this line,30 it is framed
within the FLT and aims to clarify for teachers the type of units they should bear in
mind in order to facilitate vocabulary learning for students; therefore, the term ‘lexical
unit’ is referred to a processing unit or unit of meaning, with all the types of meanings
we know exist.
Nevertheless, for other authors, for example McCarthy (1990:â•›
6 and sections)
they are not a lexical unit, but a relation of meaning, that accounts for syntagmatic or
ïœ²ïœ·.â•… The idiom principle, holds that a speaker has a wide number of semi-built blocks that
he/she can combine when speaking, and is opposed to the open choice principle, which states
that vocabulary is understood as a group of individual words that can be used very freely and
are only limited by grammatical rules. This contribution by Sinclair means a step forward in
the collocationist view on language.
ïœ²ïœ¸.â•… From a linguistic perspective, lexical units are those that possess a unitary meaning
and a referential unit and, therefore, are included in the dictionary (Bustos Gisbert 1986:â•›66).
Â�
According to this concept of lexical unit we could not say that collocations are lexical units,
since they are used to refer to frequent combinations of certain words, but do not always have
a referential unit.What worldly reality does saludar atentamente [to wave politely] or enemigo
acérrimo [worst enemy] refer to, for example?
ïœ²ïœ¹.â•… […the unit of meaning in the mental lexicon that acts as a vehicle element of the Spanish
culture and can be formed by one or more words (cabeza, paraguas, dinero negro, a la chita
callando, tomar el pelo, no hay más cera que la que arde, etc.)].
ïœ³ïœ°.â•… In spite of the fact that the units we are looking at in these works – namely: compounds,
collocations,syntagmatic compounds,idiomatic expressions and institutionalized expressions
or routine formulas – are of a very varied nature, in fact some are equivalent to a grammatical
category, others to a phrase and others to a sentence. This heterogeneity can be justified from
the moment we accept that there are many dimensions of meaning: collocational, referential,
pragmatic, discursive, etc.
ïœ´ïœµïœ¸	 Marta Higueras García
Â�combinatory relations.31 Schmitt (2000:â•›
76 and sections) agrees with this approach,
and explains the phenomenon of collocations as a property, a tendency, that appears
in different degrees from free combinations to idiomatic ones.
In addition, we would like to underline the fact that knowing the collocation of
words helps to distinguish synonyms (or words that share semes, like mirar – ver [to
look, to see] and coger – tomar [to get, to take]) and to promote the creation of correct
associations between words that tend to appear together in a specific language.
Also, we remind that teaching collocations is consequent with qualitative learning
(Lewis 1993), that is, learning more about the words we know, as opposed to quanti-
tative learning, which only focuses on the number of new words taught; lastly, it is a
linguistic content that lends itself to autonomous learning, since the student can count
on a series of lexicographic works that will help him or her with both codification and
decoding of messages.
6.â•… 
Future projects and lines of investigation
In spite of the rare presence of collocations in linguistics32 and of the minimal
Â�
consensus regarding their nature and characteristics, paradoxically, the practical
applications of this concept do not cease to bear their fruit in lexicography and FLT.
We will firstly comment on three ongoing projects. The first is the completion
of the combinatory dictionary DICE, an absolute essential since it is the only one
that applies the theory of lexical functions of the Meaning Text Theory to Spanish
Â�
vocabulary. Since this dictionary is characterized by the use of a broad conception
of collocation, not based exclusively on frequency of co-apparition, consulting it can
help SFL students greatly, because in each entry all combination possibilities are given.
ïœ³ïœ±.â•… Selection (or “rection” in some terminological systems) is also a relation established
between two units. Some verbs govern or select certain prepositions, and the lexical meaning
also restricts the combination possibilities of words. NGLE (2009:â•›13).
ïœ³ïœ².â•… In the NGLE (2009) collocations are timidly mentioned, as can be expected, since it is
not a typical grammatical content, unless adjacent cases are studied with morphological units.
The following is said of collocations: on page 855 it is said that we consider the following
combinations to be collocations and not idioms: enemigo acérrimo, esfuerzo ímprobo, error
garrafal.It insists that they are more productive than idioms,as a differentiating characteristic:
the highest level of productivity is shown in syntactical units and the lowest in idioms, which
do not allow the substitution of their components by a synonym, but which collocations
do allow because they are more productive: labor ímproba, tarea ímproba, trabajo ímprobo.
There is even an attempt to define ‘collocation’: frequent and preferential constrained lexical
Â�
combinations, semantically restricted (p. 855 and 2654). On page 748 there is an insistence
on the fact that collocations are fully integrated in syntax, since they allow coordination: una
ímproba y penosa tarea, while idioms do not allow this characteristic: *caja fuerte y segura.
	 Lexical collocations and the learning of Spanish as a foreign language 	 ïœ´ïœµïœ¹
For example, as pointed out by Sanromán (2003:â•›19), even combinations such as gran
Â�silencio and silencio absoluto [great silence and absolute silence] are both interpreted as
collocations, because both express a ‘high degree’ and it is a case of constrained lexical
concurrence. The contribution of lexical functions is undeniable, since they allow us
to assign different values to a base, in order to obtain a more or less extensive number
of collocations in each case, and to illustrate the complexity of the phenomenon of col-
locations, but at the same time this fact greatly hinders the publishing of the complete
work, given the thoroughness of the treatment of the entry-heads (bearing in mind, for
example, that the entry of the noun esperanza [hope] takes up ten pages).
Secondly, the logical evolution of the series of lexicographical publications from
SM publishers points towards the publication of a third dictionary, the heir to Redes,
aimed at SFL learners. This collocation dictionary project, in which we have had the
pleasure of collaborating, will soon appear in the near future and its orientation is
similar to that of the Oxford Collocations Dictionary for Learners of English (2001).
Thirdly, there is the project Coloca-Te33 – Collocations and new technologies –,
which aims to develop an active virtual learning environment to learn collocations in
Spanish that will allow users to learn this content autonomously. We are also work-
ing on this project, which is directed by the researcher Margarita Alonso Ramos, and
framed within the philosophy of lexical functions of the Meaning Text Theory. Other
experts from other fields also participate: a team from the University of La Coruña
in charge of the creation of contents in a learning environment based on the net, and
a team from the Universtiy of Pompeu Fabra, in charge of the automatic processing
of collocations in a learning environment based on the net. In the first phase we are
working on the analysis of a corpus of learners of Spanish CEDEL234 in order to detect
collocational errors, take note of them (using the Kwnotator tool) and classify them in
a typology that will allow a later study. The first results35 are the following:
	 •	
Of the total of collocations labelled, 61% of collocations are correct, 39%
incorrect.
	 •	
Of those incorrect, 62% reveal lexical mistakes, 33% grammatical mistakes
and 5% both.
	 •	 54% affect the collocative 20% the base and 26% the whole collocation.
	 •	 52% of mistakes are due to extension.
	 •	
The most frequent grammatical mistake is related to the verb
complementation.
ïœ³ïœ³.â•… It is the I+D (innovation and development) project of the Spanish Ministry for Science
and Innovation FFI2008-06479-C02-01/FILO. (Alonso Ramos 2010).

ïœ´ïœ¶ïœ°	 Marta Higueras García
There is also a series of projects we consider necessary, from our point of view, and
that have not begun yet, at least that we know of. One, for example, would be the
Â�
creation of a guide to help both teachers and students to use combinatory dictionaries,
since this requires certain abilities and metalinguistic knowledge, as they are diction-
aries Â�
without definitions. This guide could be accompanied by activities that could
be Â�
useful for independent learners and teachers wanting to approach this subject in
their Â�
lessons, and could be inspired by already published works associated to the BBI
dictionary for English.36
Collocations should find an important space both in general books for the teach-
ing of SFL and in specific books on autonomous vocabulary learning, and in one and
the other we found that they are timidly making an appearance,37 although rarely is
the term collocation explicitly mentioned. This is much more frequent in manuals
aimed at learning English as a foreign language, where we can even find books entirely
dedicated to learning collocations.38
A job which is still to be done is a thorough revision of the combinatory of
Â�
vocabulary as a determining element when deciding the level at which a word is
taught, which was taken into account when elaborating the Plan Curricular del Â�
Instituto
Â�
Cervantes. Niveles de referencia para el español (PCIC) (2006). Obviously, Â�
limitations
of space meant we could not do this systematically enough (if we add the size of any
monolingual dictionary and the information in a combinatory dictionary – for example
Práctico – and we compare it with the space dedicated to general and specific notions
of this project, the need to increase these inventories becomes clear). They should also
be periodically updated using new linguistic corpus and data coming from studies on
lexical availability of foreign students. Furthermore, we must consider that in this work
only vocabulary from mainland Spanish variants were taken into account and other
variants from American Spanish should be added.
As a result of this revision of collocation contents in the PCIC, it is possible that
this knowledge might be more present in certification exams of linguistic competence,
such as the DELE. Here, we can also see a field of elaboration of evaluation items, that
allow the evaluation of collocation competence in learners of SFL on different levels.
Our intention was to offer a panoramic view of the progress made and of what
is still to be done. As a conclusion, we could say that, curiously, the practical uses

of the concept of collocation are increasing in didactics and lexicography aimed at
Â�
non-native speakers, while a theoretical consensus has not been entirely reached
regarding this concept, despite it still being necessary to get to know more precisely
the place that collocations should take up in Linguistics or in Phraseology.

Denominal verbs in Ele/El2 classroom
(a didactic approach)*
Santiago Roca Marín
University of Alicante
Although denominal verbs have been included in closed categories when it
comes to derivation processes, it is possible to develop a system which helps
non-native speakers of Spanish to create them. After a thorough analysis of
Spanish Grammar textbooks, this chapter concludes that none of them include
verbal derivation in the section dedicated to the verb. The paper then offers a
non-native student-orientated typology of a specific verb formation process; i.e.
instrumental denominal verbs. This corpus has proven quite useful when dealing
with derivation in grammar textbooks. The chapter also includes both the results
of some exercises carried out by North-American students and a didactic proposal
which can simplify the teaching of Spanish as a foreign language.
Keywords:â•‡ denominal verbs; instrumental verbs; second language acquisition
In this paper we are going to propose an attempt at systematization in order to help
foreign students to create denominal verbs, even though they have been included as
lexical categories closed to all possible creativity.
In a detailed analysis of the grammars for teaching Spanish as a foreign Â�
language
(ELE) we can see that, in the section devoted to verbs, none of them include Â�
verbal
derivation. The closest we find is the suffixation of nouns and, as pointed out by
Marisa Montero (2009:â•›92): “It is devastating to search in ELE manuals for a chapter
on word formation, because it frankly does not exist”. Well, if this is the case with
word Â�
formation in general, as regards verbal derivation the situation is worse, even in
Â�
manuals on Spanish for native speakers.
Our aim in this chapter is to analyze the possibilities a type of denominal verbs
can have in an ELE class, particularly denominal verbs from an instrumental Â�
semantic
base. This verbal corpus is not very long and is highly applicable in the student’s
Â�
everyday use of the language. Verbs such as telefonear [to phone], abanicar [to fan],
acarrear [to carry/to entail], etc. would be included in this corpus.
*â•… ELE: Spanish as a foreign language, EL2: Spanish as a second language. This research was
supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science through grant HUM2006–09429.
ïœ´ïœ¶ïœ¶	 Santiago Roca Marín
To this end, we will firstly analyze denominal verbs of an instrumental base. This
will be followed by a series of grammars more used for teaching of ELE, and we will see
if the various authors cover verbal derivation in these grammars. After this Â�
analysis,
we will analyze a small test carried out in the classroom with Â�
North-American stu-
dents. Lastly, we will establish a didactic proposal for teaching the creation of these
verbs and their expansion inside the ELE classroom. Along with this, we will include
a didactic unit which will help teachers of ELE to work on the word creation in the
classroom.
1.â•… 
Denominal verbs from an instrumental base
All languages activate word production processes; in Spanish, derivation is one of
the most productive. Nevertheless, in Spanish as a foreign language or as a second
Â�
language (EL2), this process has not been studied nor systematized within the section
of verbal morphology. Students learn denominal verbs as vocabulary but are unable
to create them.
Derivation occurs in Spanish through affixing processes which can be divided
into two kinds:
a.	 Appreciative affixing: a simple change of meaning takes place as regards the
lexical base.
b.	 Non-appreciative affixing: it involves the creation of a new term.
Non-appreciative affixing allows us to create a verb in Spanish using a noun or an
adjective. In this section, we are going to study non-appreciative affixing from an
instrumental base. For this purpose, we will succinctly analyze the affixing processes
used by native speakers of Spanish.
From a morphological point of view, in Spanish there are two processes for the
formation of verbs: suffixation and parasynthesis (Lang 1997 & Serrano 1999). Â�Bolaños
(2009) explains these processes as follows:
a.	 Suffixation consists in the addition of a derivational suffix to a noun base: taponar
[to block].
	 NOUN + –AR, –EAR, –IFICAR, –IZAR and –ECER
b.	 Parasynthesis implies a suffixation process plus a prefixing process: amartillear
[to hammer].
	 Most frequent structures:
	 –	 [A + NOUN + ECER]
	 –	 [EN + NOUN + ECER]
	 –	 [EN + NOUN + AR]
	 –	 [A + NOUN + AR]
	 Denominal verbs in Ele/El2 classroom (a didactic approach)	 ïœ´ïœ¶ïœ·
There are less productive combinations:
	 –	 [A + NOUN + EAR]
	 –	 [A + NOUN + IZAR]
	 –	 [EN + NOUN + IZAR]
This is a complex process, since it implies morphological, syntactic and Â�
semantic
aspects, hence the difficulty to include it in the ELE/L2 classes. However, Bolaños
(2009:â•›34) points out:
we strongly believe that it is possible to find structural similarities that respond
to a typology of this semantic pattern and that can allow us to group these verbs
in subgroups, within instrumental verbs, thus making it possible both to limit
the creative productivity of these forms and to foresee new forms based on these
patterns.
But, how can we define so-called instrumental verbs? According to Serrano-Dolader
(1999:â•›4270) “they are verbs whose meaning can be paraphrased as: to carry out an
action with the help of an object designated by the base noun”.
Of the different suffixes used for the creation of a verb from the first Â�
conjugation
group, in this paper we have chosen -ar and -ear. The form -ar is the universal form
of the first conjugation group and what learners of Spanish think of automatically;
the form -ear is the second most used form and adds an iterative value (Serrano-
Dolader 1999:â•›4692) to the verb as opposed to the form -ar. We consider this iterative
value Â�
relevant to our investigation on the production of denominal verbs on behalf of
Â�
learners of Spanish as we will point out in other sections.
As regards their construction, one of the most relevant aspects a learner of
Spanish can face is the irregularity that the base upon which the new verb is built
may present. However, the change from a noun to a verb ending in -ar does not
present Â�
irregularities from a formal point of view, as mentioned by Serrano-Dolader
(1999:â•›4689):
â•ﬁ
– Irregularities do not normally occur in the change from noun to verb ending
in -ar:
â•ﬁ
– Bases ending in a vowel drop it: aceite > aceitar [oil > to oil].
â•ﬁ
– Bases ending in a consonant directly add the verb ending: almacén >
Â�
almacenar [store > to store].
â•ﬁ
– The ending -ad is also dropped: enemistad > enemistar [enmity > to make
an enemy].
â•ﬁ
– The base of the derived verb does not have a diphthong: cimiento> cimentar
[foundation > to lay foundations].
â•ﬁ
– Change from /e/ to /i/: dictamen > dictaminar [ruling > to rule].
â•ﬁ
– In some bases there are peculiarities caused by:
â•ﬁ
– Own peculiarities: escoba > escobazar [sweeping brush > to sweep].
ïœ´ïœ¶ïœ¸	 Santiago Roca Marín
â•ﬁ
– Loanwords from other languages: imán > imantar [magnet > to magÂ�
netize], from French.
â•ﬁ
– The base being Latin: cal > calcinar [lime scale > to calcine].
On the form ending in -ear, Serrano-Dolader (1999:â•›4692) states that:
â•ﬁ
– Verbs ending in -ear are formed upon simple bases.
â•ﬁ
– It is frequent for them not to conserve tonic diphthongs from the bases:
Â�
espuela > espolear [spurs > to spur].
â•ﬁ
– Cases of cancellation of phonic substance from the base in which the
Â�ending -ero is dropped are rare: carpintero > carpintear [woodworker > to
work wood].
â•ﬁ
– Verbs ending in -ear presenting interfixes are rare.
This systematization of derivational forms simplifies the creation of denominal verbs
with the forms -ar and -ear.
2.â•… 
Verbal derivation in the grammars of ELE
In ELE grammars or in manuals where conjugations are explained, the infinitive is
treated as an invariable lexical category, and never as a product of derivation. As we
mentioned in the introduction, only some grammars briefly include derivation of
nouns and little more. In this sense, we have revised the grammars of ELE/EL2 to
check if they make any reference to the creation of verbs from nouns. In each of them,
we have searched in the section dedicated to the verb and particularly to the infinitive.
Next, we listed the grammars analyzed and how each one approaches the explanation
of the infinitive in Spanish.
In the Gramática Comunicativa del Español by Matte Bon (2006), the Â�
“infinitive”
has deserved a chapter in which morphology, usage, syntax, nominalization and
modality changes are also included. Nevertheless, in the morphology section, which is
what we are interested in in this study, the classification of verbs according to the verb
ending in Spanish is very briefly mentioned, without further details. It does, however,
enter a detailed explanation of its usage and syntactic relations.
In the grammar of Competencia gramatical en Uso, levels B1 and B2, by González
Hermoso (2007), published by Edelsa, only verb tenses and forms appear, but no
Â�
reference is made to a possible derivation.
In the grammar Español Lengua Extranjera en Gramática, levels B1 and B2, by
Concha Moreno (2007), published by Anaya, the possibility of verbal creation from a
noun or an adjective base is, again, not considered.
In the Gramática básica del español actual, all levels, by Alonso Raya (2005),
published by Difusión, the infinitive is mentioned in the section “Impersonal forms:
hablar, hablando, hablado” [to speak, speaking, spoken], where three sections are used
	 Denominal verbs in Ele/El2 classroom (a didactic approach)	 ïœ´ïœ¶ïœ¹
to discuss it: meaning and form, the infinitive as a noun and the infinitive as a verb. But
here there is no reference to verbal derivation either.
And lastly, within these grammars, the Gramática contrastiva del español para
brasileños, all levels, by Concha Moreno (2007), published by SGEL, devotes one
Â�
chapter to word derivation, but only that concerning nouns.
To conclude this section, I would like to mention that the Plan Curricular del
Instituto Cervantes (2006) (PCIC) also makes no reference to the possibility of verbal
derivation from a noun or adjective. As we will see in the following section, infinitives
would be in the vocabulary section.
We believe that all these grammars have a very practical structure and that the
grammatical explanations are very brief, except for the Gramática Comunicativa by
Francisco Matte Bon.

Evaluating a test
In order to perform this test, in which we have evaluated the ability to create an
Â�
infinitive with an instrumental semantic base from a noun, we referred to the
Â�
investigation of Javier Bolaños (2009). Of all the verbs studied by Javier Bolaños, we
selected 41 to carry out our test in the ELE course given at the University of Alicante
to Â�
North-American students.
Once the verbs had been selected, and prior to the test, we checked if these verbs
and the nouns they are based on were included in the lexical text books of the PCIC,
more specifically within the section of notions (PCIC 2006:â•›306), which are defined as:
â•ﬁ
– General Notions are those that a speaker may need whatever the context the act
of communication takes place in, meaning they refer largely to abstract concepts.
â•ﬁ
– Specific Notions are those to do with the finer details of the “here and now” in
communication and are related to interactions, transactions and specific topics.
The group of verbs and nouns, as well as their appearance, or not, in the notions Â�section
of the PCIC, have been gathered in the following table which we subdivided in the
Â�following parts:
â•ﬁ
– Firstly, the section corresponding to “noun”, that is to the noun upon which the
denominal verb is built.
â•ﬁ
– Secondly, the section corresponding to “notion in the PCIC”, that is, whether it
appears on the lexical list of the Plan Curricular del Instituto Cervantes, under
the “general notions” section (GN) or “specific notions” (SN) and at what level
Â�
according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFR), and NO if it does not appear in the PCIC.
ïœ´ïœ·ïœ°	 Santiago Roca Marín
â•ﬁ
– Thirdly, the section corresponding to “verb”, that is, the denominal verb with an
instrumental base we selected for the test given to students of Spanish.
â•ﬁ
– Lastly, the section corresponding to “notion in the PCIC”, that is, whether the
selected verb appears in the lexical list proposed by the Plan Curricular del
Â�Instituto Cervantes and at what level according to the CEFR and notions section
according to the PCIC, and NO if it does not appear in the PCIC.

Of the total 41 verbs selected, 34 do not appear in the lexical program of the PCIC.
Of the 41 nouns that act as bases for the creation of denominal instrumental verbs,
22 do not appear in the lexical program of the PCIC. We understand that the lexical
groups selected in the PCIC are related to general or specific notions which cover
certain fields of knowledge that are considered important for mastering Spanish, but
it seems alarming that it includes no instrumental verbs frequently used by Spanish
speakers.
For the test, it was no inconvenience the fact that most of these verbs were not
gathered by the PCIC, and that they were probably unknown for the student who was
going to sit the test. It gave the test a more neutral value, since it implied the student
applying verb creation rules explained previously and not resorting to their lexical
knowledge, which could alter the end result.
The test is composed of two stages:
â•ﬁ
– In the first stage, the teacher explains to the foreign students how to construct a verb
in Spanish from a noun. This explanation was given a week before the test in order
for students to be able to learn the denominal verb creation mechanism. They were
handed out a diagram so that they could later study the way derivation works.
â•ﬁ
– In the second stage, carried out a week after the explanation, the students were
asked to fill in a series of items in which they had to create a verb from a noun.
The test was divided in three parts. In the first part, of a deductive nature, students
were provided with a list of nouns on which to build the verbs.

3.1â•… Analysis of the results
The test was given to 30 North-American students, whose native language was Â�English,
of a B1/B2 level, who were studying Spanish in the Centro Superior de Idiomas at the
University of Alicante. The test took place as described above. Previously, we explained
what we aimed to achieve with this and referred to the theory explained the week
before.
	 Denominal verbs in Ele/El2 classroom (a didactic approach)	 ïœ´ïœ·ïœ³
3.2â•… Test 1
Of the total number of verbs, the number of correct answers was very uneven, as was
the systematization. Nevertheless, there were verbs created with no errors by all of
the students. Among these verbs that achieved 100% correct answers were: “abanicar
[to fan], cepillar [to brush], picar [to pick], esquiar [to ski]”. Those that achieved 90%
included: “hachar [to axe], pitar [to beep], remar [to row]”. And finally, some of those
that achieved 80% were: “cincelar [to chisel], flagelar [to whip], pincelar [to brush],
telefonear [to phone]”. It is interesting that “telefonear” should only achieve 80%, since,
on one hand, it appears in the PCIC, and on the other hand, is a commonly used verb.
In this sense, “*telefonar” was the other option given by the remaining 20%.
From the analysis of their answers we inferred that the greatest problem posed by
some of these verbs is not knowing the meaning of the lexical base upon which they
are built, on the one hand, for example: “capote [cloak], flagelo [whip], maza [mace],
rejón [lance], etc”, and on the other hand, the iterative value added by the suffix -ear to
the verb’s lexical base: “guantear [to slap], pelotear [to rally], etc.”. Both elements add
a certain degree of difficulty to the creative aspect that implies a greater knowledge
of the language from a semantic point of view and which the students at this level of
learning did not yet posses.
We believe that the iterative value added by the suffix -ear is difficult for students
learning Spanish at this level to infer. In any case, many of the verbs that select the
Â�suffix -ar still provide that iterative value meaning repetition of the action, but this
value is already in the lexical base upon which the verb is created and need not be
added as a complementary value by the suffix: “remar [to row], picar [to pick], pincelar
[to brush], etc.”. This is something native speakers know but that has been difficult to
systematize up to now.
3.3â•… Test 2
The verb “esquiar” [to ski] appears three times for textual reasons, and 100% of the
Â�
students performed the derivation correctly. However, it posed a problem when it came
to deriving and then conjugating: only 28% did this properly. With the verb “patinar” [to
skate] students did not seem to encounter problems. However, of the Â�
students surveyed,
100% failed to correctly derive the verbs “teclear” [to type] and “tamborilear” [to drum]
(the latter also had to be conjugated in the gerund). Similarly to the first test, the students
had problems distinguishing the iterative value of the suffix -ear. Students opted for the
canonical form of the first conjugation group in the verb “martillar” [to hammer] as
opposed to “martillear” in 85% of the cases, both forms are accepted by the Diccionario
de la Lengua Española (DRAE). We believe they chose this option for the simplicity of
the verb derivation and not due to a knowledge about the frequency of use of the verb by
Spanish speakers. We also believe that, as is the case with other verbs ending in -ear, the
students do not perceive the semantic distinction brought about by the suffix.

Teaching of instrumental verbs in ELE classroom
Previous reflection on instrumental verbs in Spanish leads us to the proposal of a didac-
tic unit in which we could explain and teach foreign students how to build denominal
verbs from an instrumental base in Spanish. To this end we suggest a series of activities:
Firstly, we must start by going over the three conjugation models in Spanish in
order to explain that of these verbal models; at present, the only one that is productive
is the first form, verbs ending in -ar. Although with the second form, ending in -er,
we can also create verbs, they are less common and insignificant compared to the first
conjugation group. This, in principle, simplifies the combination possibilities when
creating a verb, but does not necessarily simplify derivation since the verb suffixes
added to the noun can vary, as seen above.
In order to explain verbal derivation, the student must be aware of the morpho-
logical process of derivation and, therefore, the teacher may practise and go over this
grammatical aspect with the derivation concerning nouns. We can, for example, prac-
tise with morphemes which, when added to the noun, indicate who carries out the
action: camion > camionero [lorry > lorry driver].
After this, we must go on to explain how to build a verb with a noun base. We
must start with a simple example to make it easier for the students to understand so as
to later explain the different verb suffixes with which to build verbs:
Noun Verbal suffix Composition New verb
abanico -ar abanic + ar abanicar
Although the universal canonic suffix of the first conjugation group is -ar, we
must explain to the students that there can be other suffixes which act less frequently.
The derivational suffixes that combine with a noun to create a verb are:
SUFFIXES
NOUN -AR, -EAR, -IFICAR, -IZAR Y -ECER
As well as these combinations, it is also possible to combine a prefix and a suffix:
Prefix Noun Suffix Example
A + Tarde + ECER Atardecer
EN + Sombra + ECER Ensombrecer
EN + Cesta + AR Encestar
A + Canelón + AR Acanelonar
Other less productive combinations are:
Prefix Noun Suffix Example
A + Palo + EAR Apalear
A + Tierra + IZAR Aterrizar
EN + Cólera + IZAR Encolerizar

4.1â•… Activities
	 38.	 Guiding the practise using a series of specific verbs.
Ex. ABANICO →	abanico →	abanic → verbal suffix -AR → ABANICAR
Activity 1
After looking at the example above, answer the following questions:
(97)â•… How is a verb created in Spanish from a noun?
(98)â•… Which conjugation group is the most used to create verbs?
Activity 2
Now, try and create a verb using the following nouns:
1.â•…Pito
2.â•…Lima
You may follow the pattern from the example in the previous activity. If you do
not know the meaning of the nouns and of the verbs created you may look them
up in the dictionary and see if the exercise has been done correctly.
The important thing about this activity is that the student creates a verb using a
noun despite not knowing its meaning. In principle, the aim is to automatize the
morphological functioning of verbal derivation.
Activity 3
The previous activity can be proposed from an inductive perspective asking the
student a question after the periphrastic construction of the verb.
(99)â•… Which verb is used to define the action “tocar el pito” [to blow a whistle]?
(100)â•…
Which verb is used to define the action “pasar la lima” [to rub the file]
against the nails?
Activity 4
Say which of the following verbs are correctly constructed.
	 –	Esquiar
	 –	Remear
	 –	Pincelear
	 –	Palear
	 –	Patinar
In order to see if your answer is correct, look them up in the dictionary.
ïœ´ïœ·ïœ¶	 Santiago Roca Marín
Within the first conjugation group, the two most productive forms are -ar and
-ear. The criteria according to which we choose one or the other are not systematized,
and this can lead the learners of Spanish to a confusion. It is difficult to acquire the
linguistic-pragmatic competence of a native speaker at this level, but reflection and
systematic work can help develop it. In this sense, we can perform an inductive Â�activity
in which the student should explain the differences found between the use of the
Â�morphemes -ar and -ear.
Activity 5
Why do you think the form -AR or -EAR is used in the following
verbs? Does the meaning change if one or the other is used?
	 –	Patear
	 –	Patinar
	 –	Talonear
	 –	Esquiar
	 –	Limar
5.â•… Conclusions
In conclusion, we would like to point out how little verbal derivation has been studied in
the teaching of Spanish as a foreign language or second language, which means that we
are really looking at an untouched field of study. We understand that there is a problem
of systematization and applicability, but we also believe that ELE/EL2 grammars cannot
only cover the obvious, they should go into further depth and think about those students
that are above the average level and which acquire a competence in Spanish equivalent
to level C1, but that still study Spanish as foreigners. The difficulty brought about by sys-
tematization and its explanation should not justify the absence of references in grammars.
The analysis of the test, after explaining the derivation process to the students, proves that
they are capable of creating verbs. It is, therefore, necessary to include verbal derivation in
the morphology section as a word formation process in Spanish. In this sense, we believe
there should be a systematization of verbal derivation, as well as specific material created
in order to allow students learning Spanish to work on this aspect of derivation.
