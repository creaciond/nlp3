There exists a theory that this document displays a writing tradition in strong discrepancy
with the standard cuneiform conventions. This ad-hoc hypothesis is, in our opinion, a very
strong and unacceptable case of “special pleading”. Nothing supports this hypothesis that
Hurrian created a “special” cuneiform convention to write the letter of Tušratta to Amenophis
III. The E24 Mitanni letter seems to be written in perfectly standard cuneiform conventions.
Moreover, such a hypothesis conflicts with the tendency of Akkadian to prevail over Hurrian
even in the Hurrian-speaking areas. It is just unthinkable that Hurrian people or scribes would
revolutionize the Akkadian-based conventions. Morevover, according to Wilhelm (1996:180),
the letters of Tušratta are written in nearly the same ductus as most literary texts written in
Akkadian that have been found in the libraries of Boğazköy.57
It is hard to figure out how the
theory that the Mitanni letter should be written in a “different” writing system can handle all
these obvious signs of a complete formal and structural continuity.
According to that theory, <ku> and <gu> would stand for *[k/go] and *[k/gu].58
The
instances of <ku> and <gu> in the Mitanni letter are:
a) Initial position:
- no <ku>,
- <gu> in I 45 <gu-ru-u-[ša]>, I 83 <gu-lu-u-ša>, II 56 <gu-lu-ša-ú>, II 105 <gu-li-a-
a-[ma-a-an]>, II 106 <gu-li-a-a-ma>, III 15 <gu-ru>,
b) Non-initial position:
57
«Une grande partie des textes akkadiens littéraires retrouvées dans les bibliothèques de Boğazköy sont écrits avec
un ductus pratiquement identique à celui des lettres de Tušratta.»
58
Cf. Wilhelm 2004a and Bush 1961:22.

- <ku> in I 87 <a-ku-u-ša>, I 115 <[na]-ak-ku-ša-a-ú>, II 21 <tup-pa-ku-u-uš-¯é-

>, II 24 <[...]-na-a-ku-lu-uš-te-la-an>, II 61 <a-ku-u-ša-a-an-ni>, II 68 <šu-

III 103 <na-wu-uk-gu-ú-un>,
Is this corpus a reason to think <ku> and <gu> are anything but graphic variants? The
reasons not to believe are: (1) <ku> never appears initially; (2) some items seem to be variants
of the same words: Mit. II 68 <šu-uk-ku-u-ut-ti> = Mit. II 70 <šuk-gu-ú-ud-du-u-u-¯a>; Mit. I
87 <a-ku-u-ša> = Mit. I 81 <a-gu-ú-a>. There is no basis for a contrast between */Ku/ and
**/Ko/. The signs <ku> and <gu> are variants.
Another claim of that theory is that <ki> and <gi> should contrast. <ki> and <gi> would
stand for *[k/gi] and *[k/ge].59
The instances of <ki> and <gi> in the Mitanni letter are:
a) Initial position:
- <ki> in I 96 <ki-i-in>, II 87 <ki-im-ra-a-at-ta-a-an>, II 103 <ki-i-pu-[...]-a-la-a-en>,
II 114 <ki-i-pa-aš-ši-ib-wə>,

še-na>,
b) Non-initial position:
- <ki>, always geminate, in I 97 <e-ru-uš-ki-i-in-na>, II 16 <a-ki-[...]>, II 52 <na-ak-
ki-du-u-we-en>, II 103 <šur-wu-uš-ti-ik-ki-i-in>, III 3 <ta-du¯-¯u-li-ik-ki-in-na-a-

- <gi>, never geminate, in I 101 <d
Ši-mi-i-gi-[...]>, I 105 <d
Ši-mi-i-gi-ni-e-wə>, I
106 <d
Ši-mi-i-gi-níš>,
What are the indications that <ki> and <gi> may contrast? What is the difference
between <gi-pa-a-n(...)> and <ki-i-pa-n(...)>, which appears several times in the letter? And
word-internally, we can see that <gi> is never geminate and <ki> is always geminate. There is
no basis for a contrast between */Ki/ and **/Ke/.
The theory about the Mitanni letter having a “special” cuneiform convention is a fiction.
The distributional features of the cuneiform signs conflict with this approach.
59
Cf. Wilhelm 2004a and Bush 1964:22.
2. Phonology, Writing Systems, Texts 27
A more tricky issue is the difference between <te> and <ti>. There is no instance of
variant writings in the letter, so it would seem that they contrast. They combine with vowel
signs as shown in the table:
-u- -i- -e- -a- -ú-
ti X exists exists exists X
te exists X exists X X
What appears is a near complete complementary distribution. But <te-e-> and <ti-e->
contrast with each other. Tešub is written <te-e-š-šu-ub>, and the Ugaritic alphabet shows that
there is no consonant between <t> and <š>. Our analysis is that the difference between <te-e->
and <ti-e-> is not vocalic but is a device to write the glottal stop: <te-e-> is *[ti:-] but <ti-e> is
*[ti-"i-]. The complex forms <e-ti-i-e-e-(...)> and <e-ti-i-i-(...)> can be interpreted as standing
for *[i-ti:-"i:-] and *[i-ti:-"i-] respectively. Word-initially, <e-(e)-> and <i-(i)-> also contrast and
this can be interpreted as standing for *[i(:)-] and *["i(:)-] respectively. The existence of a
glottal stop is quite sure: what do Mit. I 83 <gu-lu-u-u-ša>, Mit. I 110 <a-nu-ú-a-ma-a-an>, Mit.
II 124 <¯u-ra-a-a-ti>, Mit. I 85 <ta-a-a-nu-u-ša> stand for, if there is not a glottal stop to enable a
syllabication?
Another issue is the interpretation of <-u-> and <-ú->, both of which seem to stand for
the vowel */u/. There is a consistent pattern showing that <u> is *["u] but <ú> is [u]. Both are
written word-initially as <†> in Ugaritic script: <u-u-mi-i-ni> ‘country’ is [† m n] and <ú-ú-na>
‘to come’ is [† n]. But the Egyptian pharaoh Neb-Maât-Râ is spelled <Ni-im-mu-u-ri-i-a>
*[nimmu"uri:"a] whereas the God Amon is spelled <A-ma-a-nu-ú> *["ama:nu:]. There is (at
least) one glottal stop in Maât and none in Amon. <ti> and <te> can be followed by <-u-> but
not <-ú->, because the glottal stop of <u> *["u] prevents the assimilation *[i-u] > *[iw] > *[i:].
There are instances of <-ú-ú->: Mit. II 90 <a-ú-ú-rat-ta-ma-an>, Mit. II 93 <šu-ú-ú-ra>, Mit. II
114 <¯i-ši-im-du-a-ú-ú-un>, Mit. III 2 <a-ru-u-ša-ú-ú-un>. This graphic device distinguishes
<-a-ú> *[aw] from <-a-ú-ú-> *[a"u:]. Mit. II 93 <šu-ú-ú-ra> is *[šu-"u:-ra]. These conclusions
are valid only for the Mitanni letter, because, in Nuzi, the contrary seems to be true: there, <-ú->
stands for *["u], as suggested by Berkooz and erroneously dismissed in Speiser (1941:22). This
shows that the different scribal traditions for cuneiform should not be equated from one site to
another. As noted by Speiser (1941:22), “The syllabaries which differentiate between voiced
and voiceless stops also employ <ú> to the exclusion of <u>.”
The graphic devices, valid for the Mitanni letter, can be summarized in this table:
Word-initial #e- *[i-] #i- *["i-] #ú- *[u-] #u- *["u-]
Double initial #e-e- *[i:-] #i-i- *["i:-] #ú-ú- *[u:-] #u-u- *["u:-]
Word-internally Ci-e- [*i"i-] Ci-i-i- *[-i:"i-] -a-ú- *[aw] Cu-ú *[-u:-]
Word-internally Ci-e-e- [*i"i:-] Ci-i-e-e- *[-i:"i:-] Cv-ú-ú *[v-"u:-] Cv-u *[v-"u-]
This confirms that the vocalic system of Hurrian includes only */a/, */i/ and */u/. And
this also raises the issue of phonemic length in Hurrian. The word ‘earth’ must be */u:mi:ni/ and
cannot be */u:mi"ini/ as shown by Ugaritic [† m n], and only one of the long vowels can be
accented. This suggests that vocalic length was marginally phonemic in Hurrian: there exist a
28 2. Phonology, Writing Systems, Texts
few rare cases of long vowels that are most probably not accented but length coincided with
accent most of the time.
Proto-Indo-European Phonology
Several reconstructions have been proposed for the Proto-Indo-European phonological
system. The most complex system is that of the Neogrammarians (cf. Brugmann 1904:52).
Among more recent reconstructions, that of Szemerényi (1996:69—70) is closest to that of the
Neogrammarians, while the simplest system is that proposed by Lehmann (1952:99), which is as
follows:
1. Obstruents: p t k k¦
b d g g¦
bº dº gº g¦º
s
2. Resonants: m n
w r l y
3. Vowels: e a o
i· e· a· o· u·
4. Laryngeals: x h "
Other recent reconstructions include those of Beekes (1995:124—125) and the system of
Gamkrelidze—Ivanov (1995.I:116), in which the plain voiced stops of traditional Proto-Indo-
European are reinterpreted as glottalized stops (ejectives). Lehmann (2002:196—202) discusses
and evaluates each of these reconstructions and then proposes a slightly updated version of his
earlier views.
The system of stops reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European by Fortson (2004:51), Sihler
(1995:135), and Clackson (2007:34) is followed here:
Labial Dental Palatal Velar Labiovelar
Voiceless p t $ k k¦
Voiced (b) d ĝ g g¦
Voiced aspirated bh dh ĝh gh g¦h
According to Lehmann, a series of resonants is also to be reconstructed for Proto-Indo-
European: *m, *n, *w, *l, *r, *y. The resonants could function as syllabics or non-syllabics
depending upon their environment. They were non-syllabic (1) when between vowels or initially
before vowels, (2) when preceded by a vowel and followed by a consonant, and (3) when
preceded by a consonant and followed by a vowel. The resonants became syllabic in early
2. Phonology, Writing Systems, Texts 29
Proto-Indo-European when the stress-conditioned loss of former contiguous vowels left them
between two non-syllabics, thus: *CVRCô > *CəRCô > *CÇCô.
The laryngeals will be written here as: *H÷, *Hø, *Hù, *Hú (= Lehmann’s */"/, */x/, */ /,
and */h/, respectively). Both Fortson and Clackson write *h÷, *hø, *hù.
Clackson (2007:34) reconstructs the following vowels: short: *e, *o, *(a); long: *ē, *ō,
*(ā).60
He notes (2007:36):
We shall see later in this chapter (section 2.5) that the loss of laryngeals in most of the PIE
languages also had concomitant effects on the vowel system, and there is still debate about whether the
reconstructed system really needs the vowels *a and *ā, which accordingly have been bracketed in the
phoneme inventory given in table 2.4. Over the last fifty years the scholarly consensus has swayed
between accepting these vowels in the parent language and rejecting them. Some Indo-Europeanists have
gone even further and reconstructed an original vowel system with only one vowel, *e. At present, the
balance of opinion has settled in favour of reconstructing *a and *ā, principally supported by
correspondence sets such as the word for ‘nose’, which in different IE languages derives from a stem *nas-
or *nās-.
60
For different (and conflicting) interpretations concerning the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European vowels,
especially on the phonemic status of *i and *u and diphthongs, cf. Beekes 1995:137—142, Brugmann 1904:66—
109, Fortson 2004:60—62, Lehmann 1952:7—21, Meillet 1964:98—126, Szemerényi 1996:37—45.

Overview, Derivational Morphology, and Syntax
Overview of Morphology
Structurally, Hurrian is an agglutinating language. It is exclusively suffixing. There are
no examples of prefixes or infixes. All affixes are suffixes, of which there are a large number.
Though word order tends to be verb-final (SOV), there is a good deal of flexibility here.61
As
noted by Bush (1964:96), who follows Speiser (1941), there are three fundamental stem types in
Hurrian: (1) verbal stems; (2) nominal (and adjectival) stems; and (3) particles. Some stems are
typically nouns, like attai ‘father’, while others are typically verbs, like pa- ‘to build’, but it
should be borne in mind that there is a considerable permeability between the classes of words,
and some endings can be suffixed to different classes of words: for example, the Instrumental
case-marker can be added to a noun: išu¯ni ‘silver’ > išu¯nae ‘with silver’, to an adjective
conjugated in the past tense (!): niri ‘good’ > nir-u-š-ae ‘swiftly’; to a verb: sidi- ‘to curse’ >
sidi-l-ae ‘(while) cursing repeatedly’; to a number: šin ‘two’ > šin-ae ‘on the second day’. The
two syntagms ‘with love’ and ‘lovingly’ can get only one translation into Hurrian: tad-ae. On
the whole, most stems are verbs, and there are two frequent nominalizing suffixes: -i for non-
finite verbal forms and -š for finite verbal forms. On the contrary, it seems that there is no suffix
to create a verb. Any stem that ends with a consonant is implicitly a verb. A root with a string
of suffixes becomes a noun, only when it is made to be so either with -ni, or -nna ‘Definite
article (sg./pl.)’ or with -i, which could be described as being the ‘Indefinite article’. Maybe it
would be even more accurate to say that it does not “become” a noun: the undifferentiated stem
is just made to function syntactically like a noun. This fluidity was noted by Speiser (1941:199):
“The parts of speech are thus often interchangeable and dependent for their function on their
actual position in the sentence.”
Hurrian makes only a very limited use of compounds. One productive type is the “n-year-
old” type: šin-arbu ‘two-year-old’; tumn-arbu ‘four-year-old’. Another point is the extremely
limited resort to reduplication. Very few verbs display this feature: kil- ‘(intr.) to rise, (tr.) to
raise’ > kiligil(išt)- ‘id’.
61
So Gragg (2003:255): “Word order tends to be verbal final, but all permutations occur. The language has
postpositions, and the extensive nominal and verbal morphology is exclusively suffixing.”
32 3. Overview, Derivational Morphology, and Syntax
Derivational Morphology
In Hurrian, derivational suffixes can be used to form either nouns or adjectives. They are
added after the stem vowel. They include the following:
1. -ant- used to create adjectives: abi ‘face, front’ > awant- ‘anterior’; pisu- ‘to rejoice’ >
pisant- ‘happy’. Compare the Proto-Indo-European adjective ending *-ent-/*-ont-/*-‚t-. It is
preserved in a small number of adjectives, as illustrated by the following Sanskrit examples
(taken from Burrow 1973:144): b0hánt- ‘great’, mahánt- ‘great’, 0hánt- ‘small’, p1[ant-
‘speckled’, and rúśant- ‘bright’. This ending was also used to create participles. In Hittite,
there is only one participle form: -ant- (cf. Hoffner—Melchert 2008:134—135 and 339—
340; Kloekhorst 2008:183—184). It is neither active nor passive, but, rather, it is used to
form participles on stative verbs (cf. Lehmann 2002:183): adant- ‘eaten, having eaten’,
kunant- ‘killed’, akkant- ‘having died, dead’. In the other daughter languages, this ending is
used to form present participles: Sanskrit adánt- ‘eating’, bhárant- ‘bearing’, bhávant-
‘being’; Greek d οντ- ‘eating’, φέροντ- ‘bearing’; Latin edent- ‘eating’, ferent- ‘bearing’,
amant- ‘loving’; Gothic bairand- ‘bearing, carrying’; etc. As noted by Burrow (1973:144),
the specialization of this suffix in participial use, though ancient, is a secondary development.
2. -ardi-: used to create collectives: śalardi- ‘group of daughters’ (cf. śal- ‘daughter’); attardi-
‘forefathers’ (cf. attai- ‘father’); ardardi- ‘citizens, townspeople’ (cf. arde- ‘town’); älardi-
‘female relatives’ (cf. äli- ‘sister’). There may be a parallel here with Indo-European. In Old
Irish, -red, -rad is a common collective suffix, and comparable forms are found in other
Celtic languages (cf. Welsh -red). This suffix is usually taken to be a derivative of the Proto-
Indo-European root *ret-/*rot- ‘to turn, to revolve, to roll’, which is found in: Latin rota
‘wheel’; Old Irish roth ‘wheel’, rethid ‘to run’, riuth ‘running’; Welsh rhod ‘wheel’, rhawd
(< *rōt-) ‘troop’; Sanskrit rátha- ‘chariot’; Lithuanian rãtas ‘wheel’ (cf. Pokorny 1959:866).
Perhaps the same process was at work in Hurrian as in Celtic, and we have what was
originally an independent word meaning something like ‘group, collection’ (cf. Welsh rhawd
‘troop’ for the semantics), which has survived only as a suffix.
3. -Hn- attested in umini *[úmi:ni] ‘land’.
4. -¯¯i-/-¯¯e- and -¯i-: used to create adjectives denoting “relating to” or “pertaining to” the
noun from which they are derived; also used in ethnonyms: Àalba¯i- ‘pertaining to the town
Alep’ (cf. Àalba ‘the town Alep’), turu¯¯i- ‘male’, aštu¯¯i- ‘womanly, feminine’ (cf. ašte
‘woman’). The suffix is preceded by -u in general, sometimes -a in place names, or nothing
except as in <URU
Du-ug-ri-iš-¯i e-bi-ir-ni> KUB XXXVII 38 IV 14 ‘The Tukhrishite lord’.
The general case is: ¯atti > ¯attu¯i. In Proto-Indo-European, there was a derivational suffix
*-VHø- (*-eHø- > *-ā-; *-iHø- > *-ī-; *-uHø- > *-ū-). One of its functions was to create
adjectives denoting “relating to” or “connected with” the noun or verb from which they were
derived (cf. Brugmann 1888—1895.II/I:112 and 1904:341—347). This usage can be found
in Hittite in forms such as: annanu¯¯a- ‘trained (of animals)’, from annanu- ‘to train, to
educate’. *-VHø- was also used to create abstract nouns. In later Proto-Indo-European, these
formations became associated with the feminine gender, and it is no longer possible, except
in rare cases, to distinguish the earlier usage; for example, Burrow (1973:195) notes that
“[t]he adjective mahZ ‘great’ remains in Sanskrit the only non-feminine adjectival ā-stem,
3. Overview, Derivational Morphology, and Syntax 33
and it is defective.” At an earlier stage of development, however, the feminine gender did
not exist (cf. Burrow 1973:201—203; Lehmann 2002:65—67).
5. -isk- attested in summi ‘hand’ > šummiški ‘apprentice’, and tadi- ‘to love’ > tadaraskae
(Intr.) ‘as the one who starts to love again and again’ (?). In Indo-European, there is a fairly
common verbal suffix *-s$e/o-. Its meaning varies somewhat from language to language (cf.
Fortson 2004:90; Szemerényi 1996:273—274). In Hittite, it can have durative, iterative,
progressive, distributive, and inchoative meanings (cf. Hoffner—Melchert 2008:318—322;
Kloekhorst 2008:767—770). In Sanskrit, it forms a special present stem, with no apparent
semantic change, and the same generally applies to Greek, though some Homeric,
Herodotean, and Ionic forms seem to have a meaning similar to what is found in Hittite. In
Latin, this suffix has taken on inchoative meaning. In Tocharian, it has causative meaning.
Hittite appears to have preserved the original meaning. Examples include: Greek
(reduplicated) γ γνώ ω ‘to perceive, to know’; Latin nōscō ‘to become acquainted with, to
know’. Vedic p0ccháti ‘to ask’; Latin poscō ‘to ask, to request’; Old High German forscōn
‘to inquire, to search (for), to look into, to investigate’ (New High German forschen); Old
Irish arco ‘to ask’. Vedic 0ccháti ‘to go (to), to reach, to obtain’; Hittite ar-aš-ki-iz-zi ‘to
come (to), to arrive (at)’. There is also a nominal suffix *-is$-, which serves to create
diminutives in Greek and Tocharian (cf. Greek πα ί ος ‘little boy’, πα ί ‘little girl’;
Tocharian B mäñcu[ke ‘prince’), while, in Germanic, it serves to create adjectives from
nouns (cf. Gothic barnisks ‘childish’, mannisks ‘human’; Old English mennisc ‘human’).
*-s$- is also found as a primary nominal suffix: cf. Sanskrit p0cchā ‘question, inquiry’.
6. -k(k)a- diminutive: aštaga ‘(young) woman, maiden’ (cf. ašte ‘woman’), ta¯akka/ta¯aga
‘(young) man’ (cf. ta¯e ‘man’), Àanakka personal name (cf. ¯an- ‘child’). In Indo-
European, there is a diminutive suffix *-ko-, as illustrated by the following Sanskrit
examples: marya-ká- ‘young man’ (cf. Greek εsρα ‘young girl, lass’, ε ρ ον ‘young
boy, lad’), kumāra-ká- ‘little boy’, putra-ká- ‘little son’. *-ko- could also be used as a
general suffix to form nouns and adjectives, in which case it does not appear to have affected
the meaning in any way.
7. -m(m)e/i meaning unknown: purame ‘servant’, äl(a)mi ‘oath’, ¯almi ‘song’. In Indo-
European, the suffix *-mo- is exceptionally productive. It is used to form both nouns and
adjectives, and a whole host of derivative suffixes are built on it. A few examples from
Sanskrit will suffice: gharmá- ‘heat, warmth, sunshine’ (cf. Greek ερ ός ‘hot, warm’; Latin
formus ‘hot, warm’), dhárma- ‘law’, ájma- ‘career, march’ (cf. Greek –γ ος ‘a straight line, a
furrow’).
8. -ni used to create (concrete) deverbal derivatives: sidar- ‘to curse’ > sidarni ‘curse’; muši-
‘to put, to pile up, to tidy up’ > mušuni ‘woodlog piler’; naw- ‘to graze’ > nawni ‘pasture’;
barini ‘baker’, barantarini ‘cook’ and wutarini ‘dishwasher’. Compare the Proto-Indo-
European suffix *-ni-, used to create nouns and adjectives, as in the following Sanskrit
examples: śrózi- ‘hip’, gh1zi-‘heat’, yóni- ‘womb’, p1śni- ‘speckled’, prezí- ‘loving’, váhni-
‘carrying’, etc.
9. -ni-, -nni-: used to create adjectives and nouns: ¯aši-kku-ni ‘deaf person’ (cf. ¯aš- ‘to hear’),
atta-ni ‘father’ (cf. attai ‘father’), katinna ‘speaker’ (cf. kad- ‘to speak’). In Indo-European,
the suffixes *-no-, *-ni- *-nu- are exceptionally productive. These suffixes are used to form
both nouns and adjectives, and there are a whole host of derivative suffixes as well. Again, a

few examples from Sanskrit will suffice: (1) *-no-: stena- ‘thief’, yajñá- ‘sacrifice’ (cf.
Greek Qãíüò ‘holy, pure’), gh0zá- ‘heat’, nagná- ‘naked’, pūrzá- ‘full’ (cf. Latin plēnus
‘full’; Lithuanian pìlnas ‘full’), k0[zá- ‘black’ (cf. Old Prussian kirsna- ‘black’); (2) *-ni-:
gh1zi- ‘heat’, agní- ‘fire’ (cf. Latin ignis ‘fire’; Lithuanian ugnìs ‘fire’); (3) *-nu-: sūnú-
‘son’ (cf. Gothic sunus ‘son’; Lithuanian sūnùs ‘som’), g0dhnú- ‘greedy’.
10. -š-, -išt- intensive: pisu- ‘to rejoice’ > pisantišt- ‘to be extremely happy’; talmi ‘great’ >
talawuši ‘grand, sovereign’, talmašti- ‘to celebrate, to magnify’; til- ‘to kill, to destroy’ >
tilušti- ‘to completely destroy’; sammi- ‘to rip, to tear’ > sammalašti- ‘to completely tear
apart’; šašuli- ‘to provide with food’ > šašulušti- ‘to satiate’; ¯aš- ‘to hear’ > ¯ašaš(t)- ‘to
listen carefully’; ¯ub- ‘to break’ > ¯ubušt- ‘to smash’. Compare the Proto-Indo-European
suffix *-istos, which was the usual superlative ending when the comparative was formed in
*-yes- in the latest period of development. Examples include: Sanskrit svZd-i[sha-
‘sweetest’; Greek { - το-ς ‘sweetest’; Gothic s³t-ist-s ‘gentlest’; Old English swēt-est-
‘sweetest’.
11. -š(š)e-/-š(š)i-: used to create abstract nouns: šarrašši- ‘kingship, royalty’ (cf. šarri- ‘king’
[of Semitic origin]). Note ewri-šši-¯i ‘royal’ with two suffixes. In Proto-Indo-European, *-s
was an extremely common suffix and had various usages. For example, there is a large class
of primary nominal stems in *-e/os- — examples include: *nebhos- ‘cloud, sky’ (cf. Sanskrit
nábhas-; Old Church Slavic nebo; Hittite nepiš-); *ménos- ‘mind’ (cf. Sanskrit mánas-;
Greek ένος); *genos- ‘race, kind’ (cf. Sanskrit jánas-; Greek γένος; Latin genus); etc. (for
discussion and more examples, cf. Burrow 1973:158—164). Such formations could be
turned into adjectival stems by shifting the accent from the root to the ending, as in the
following Sanskrit examples: ápas- ‘work’ ~ apás- ‘active’; táras- ‘energy, force’ ~ tarás-
‘forceful’; yáśas- ‘beauty, glory’ ~ yaśás- ‘beautiful’ (cf. Burrow 1973:160). Urartian also
has examples of this formation: gunuše ‘battle, slaughter’ (cf. Greek φόνος ‘murder,
homicide, slaughter’; Sanskrit ghaná-­ ‘slaying, killing; club’ < Proto-Indo-European
*g¦hónos).
12. -tan, -ten in professional designations: eni ‘god’ > endan ‘priest’ (literally, ‘god-worker’).
13. -ti used to create abstract derivatives, apparently from intransitive verbs: kälu- ‘to be in good
shape, mood’ > käl-di ‘health’; ¯inzu- ‘to be constrained, hard-pressed’ > ¯inziti ‘need,
want’. -ti is also used for quantities: tumna ‘four’ > tumnati ‘a group of four’. In Indo-
European, the suffix *-ti- was used to create neuter action nouns, as in the following Sanskrit
examples: gáti- ‘going’ (cf. Greek ς ‘stepping, step’ [< *g¦iti-s]), śákti- ‘power’, dh1ti-
‘firmness’, jú[si- ‘satisfaction’, śZnti- ‘peace’, k[ití- ‘dwelling’ (cf. Greek τί ς ‘founding,
foundation; settlement’), etc. This suffix was also used to create agent nouns and adjectives
in Indo-European.
14. -wi, -bi in animal names: erbi ‘dog’; serrewi ‘lamb’. In Indo-European, the suffix *-bhos
was not widespread — as a primary suffix, it only remained productive in Balto-Slavic. As a
secondary suffix, it was used to form animal names, as illustrated by the following examples
from Sanskrit and Greek: Sanskrit 0[a-bhá- ‘bull’, v0[a-bhá- ‘male, man, bull’, rZsa-bha-
‘ass’, śera-bha- the name of a snake; Greek ίραφος ‘fox’, h αφος ‘stag’, hρ φος ‘kid’.
3. Overview, Derivational Morphology, and Syntax 35
Some Considerations on the Syntax of Hurrian
Several kinds of sentences can be distinguished in Hurrian:
a) Adjectival predication, without copula:
<I
Ma-ni-en-na-ma-an pa-aš-ši-i-it-hi-ib ni-i-ri tiš-ša-an> Mit. II 86
‘And Mani, your envoy, [is] good very much.’
b) Nominal predication, with copula:
<E-er-bi ma-a-an-nu-u> Kbo 32.14 Vo IV
‘A dog it is not’
c) Intransitive verbal predication:
<ku-ú-du ka-a-zi bé-el-le-e-ni> Kbo 32.14 I 57-58
Hitt. teššumiš-kan anda amiyari maušdu.
‘Falls the cup into the canal!’
d) Transitive verbal predication:
<i-te-i-e ka-a-zi te-eš-šu-u-pa-aš> Kbo 32.14 I 56
Hitt. wala¯duyan d
IM-aš teššumin .
‘May Teššub destroy the cup!’
The last two examples are discussed in Neu (1988):
Der Vergleich mit dem Hethitischen hat gezeigt, daß das Hurritische als Ergativsprache keine besondere
Akkusativform kennt. Der Bloße Stammkasus (Absolutiv) fungiert bei transitiver Satzkonstruktion als
Objekt (Kazi, elki I 56, 57), bei intransitiver Konstruktion hingegen als Subjekt (Kazi, elki I 58), was sich
mit Bezug auf die besprochenen Sätze formelhaft folgendermaßen darstellen läßt:
SUBJEKTErgativ + OBJEKTAbsolutiv + PRÄDIKATTransitiv
SUBJEKTAbsolutiv + ADVERBIALE + PRÄDIKATIntransitiv
Im Indogermanischen hingegen, so auch im Hethitischen, wird zwischen dem Subjekt eines transitiven
Satzes und dem eines intransitiven Satzes morphologisch nicht underschieden.
Another typical feature of Hurrian sentences is the tendency to start with a string of
morphemes made up of an adverbial word followed by enclitic pronouns together with a final
particle, acting as a conjunction. This is well exemplified in the Mitanni letter:
<i-nu-ú-ut-ta-a-ni-i-in> Mit. I 74 inu’u-tta-nin ‘how me and’
<a-na-am-mi-til-la-a-an> Mit. I 76 anami-tilla-man ‘thus us and’
36 3. Overview, Derivational Morphology, and Syntax
Note this example with two strings in a row:
<un-du-ma-a-an in-na-me-e-ni-i-in> Mit. III 21 undu-man inna-mä-nin ‘And now then
when her indeed’
This manner of initiating sentences has obvious parallels in the Anatolian branch of Indo-
European. For more information on Hittite syntax, cf. Hoffner—Melchert (2008:406—429).

Nominal Morphology
Hurrian Nominal Morphology
Hurrian is usually considered to be an ergative language. Typically, the root comes first.
Nominal and verbal roots are not clearly differentiated. Nominal forms are indicated by the
addition of a stem vowel (“thematic vowel”) to the root — this vowel can be lost when certain
endings are added, such as that of the Instrumental *-á(")i <a-a-e>, which is the same for all
nouns. The most common vowel was -i-/-e-, but both -a- and (rarely) -u- were also found.
Examples include: arde- ‘town’, eni- ‘god, deity’, ašte- ‘woman’, tiwe- ‘word, thing’, eše-
‘earth’, šeni- ‘brother’, šawala- ‘year’, ut¯uru- side’. The vowel -u is found in words with strong
adverbial connections: guru ‘once’, as¯u ‘top’, as noted in Wegner (2007:52). Some words end
with a consonant, like Kušu¯ *[kuz(u)γ]. These words seem to have -u- as stem vowel. Several
pronouns have -i in the Absolutive but -u- in the other cases. The stem vowel is first followed by
a derivational suffix, then by a relational marker (case form). Hurrian has two numbers (singular
and plural) but lacks grammatical gender. The verbal suffix -gar- may represent the dual.
Though Hurrian has a small number of non-derived adjectives, most adjectives are derived from
nouns.
The so-called “definite article” (singular -ne; plural -nna) is actually an anaphoric suffix
(cf. Wilhelm 2004a:106—107) that is inserted between the noun and the case endings. The
singular is never used with the Absolutive case, but the plural is. Thus, we find the following
patterning:
Case Singular Plural
Absolutive -Ø -na [nna]
All other cases -ne *[n] -na
According to Ugaritic examples, this morpheme was probably a geminate [nn]. The
gemination can be explained as *-Hn- > -nn-.
As noted, the Hurrian “definite article”, singular -ne, plural -nna, is best viewed as an
anaphoric suffix. There may be a parallel here with Indo-European. In Indo-European, there is a
demonstrative pronoun stem that is typically reconstructed as *ne-, *no-; *H÷e-no-, *H÷o-no-. It
occurs in, for example: Sanskrit (Instr.) anéna, anáyā ‘this, these’; Lithuanian añs, anàs ‘that,
that one’; Old Church Slavic onÞ ‘that, he’; Hittite an-ni-iš ‘that, yonder’, also na-aš; Armenian
na ‘that; he, she, it; him, her’ (cf. Burrow 1973:277; Pokorny 1959:319—321; Mayrhofer
1956—1980.I:32). This stem is best seen as a distal or yonder deictic particle at the Proto-Indo-
38 4. Nominal Morphology
European level; it developed into a demonstrative pronoun in the individual daughter languages.
The H÷e-no-, *H÷o-no- variants are combinations of *H÷e/o- plus *ne/o-.
The case markers are given in the following tables. The first table gives the written
forms (cf. Bush 1964:120; Diakonoff—Starostin 1986:75; Friedrich 1969a:14; Wilhelm 2004a:

Case Singular Plural
Absolutive -Ø -Ø, -lla; -(a)ś

“Accusative” -n(i), -ne -(a)śan-i/-e

Dative -wa -(a)śa (< *-(a)ś-wa)
Locative (in, at) -a -(a)ś-a, -a
Allative (to) -da -(a)ś-ta
Ablative (from, out of) -dan -(a)ś-tan

Ablative-Instrumental -n(i), -n(e) -(a)śani, -(a)śane
Comitative (together with) -ra -(a)śura
Equative (like, as) -nna -(a)śunna
The following tables give the interpretation of what underlies the written forms:
SINGULAR a-stems i-stems u-stems

On the whole, Speiser (1941:105) can now be considered to be fairly outdated on this issue.

The so-called equative case marker -š described in Speiser (1941:204) is an erroneous analysis of person names.

Case markers can be suffixed to the following kinds of bases:
a) Nouns: šeni ‘brother’ > šeni-we (Gen); allai ‘lady’ > allai-š (Erg);
b) Nouns with the article: umini-na ‘the lands’ > umini-na-śa (Dat pl);
c) Nouns with possessive suffixes: umini-wwu ‘my country’ > umini-wwu-wa (Dat);
d) Nominalized syntagms: ar-uš-au ‘I gave’ > ar-uš-au-še-ni-we ‘of the one I gave’;
e) Compound words: Ea-Šarri ‘Ea-Šarri’ > Ea-Šarri-ni ‘the (god) Ea-Šarri (Abs)’;
f) Derivatives: pašš- ‘to send’ > pašš-it¯i ‘envoy’ > pašš-it¯i-nna ‘the envoys (Abs)’.
There is nearly no limit to the number to suffixes affixable to a given base to the point of
making them even hard to count: aš-¯u-ši-ku-un-ni-ni-bi-na-aš-ta (XII 44 ii 6) ‘to those of the
sacrifier’. The base is aš¯- ‘high’: aš¯-u-š-i-kk-u-nni-ni-bi-na-š-da is a possible segmentation,
but other proposals are possible. The principle described by Speiser (1941:200) remains valid:
“Derivational suffixes are placed ahead of the relational elements.”
The complements of a given item take the same case markers and the same article as this
item: ni¯ar-ri-we ar-uš-au-še-ni-we ‘of the dowry that I gave’. Both ni¯ari ‘dowry’ and
arušauše ‘that I gave’ display -ni- (definite article) and -we (Genitive). In general, complements
come next, but in some cases, they are disposed otherwise: <u-ul-wi-ne-e-ma a-am-mi-i-ib u-
um-mi-in-ni> KBo 32.14 Ro I 19-20 ‘And he reached the other country’. The function of ulwi is
clearly indicated by the definite article -ni, which umini also displays.
The case markers and the definite articles are prosodically enclitic. When suffixed, they
may cause the accent to move according to the prosodic classes of the words. It seems that only
the Dative plural and the Instrumental were accented — they are the only cases attested with
plene writing. Another explanation for the Dative plural is a compensatory lengthening out of
unaccented *-aź-wa > *-a:źa.
68
[a(:)] is very often plene writing in the dative plural.
40 4. Nominal Morphology
Earlier Stages of Hurrian Nominal Morphology
As has already been noted, Hurrian is usually considered to be an ergative language.
This means that the Absolutive case is used both for the subject of an intransitive verb and for
the object of a transitive verb. The Ergative case was used as the subject of a transitive verb.
However, there also appear to be traces of an Accusative in -n(i), -ne (perhaps from earlier */m/
as in Hittite and Greek within Indo-European) in animate forms.69
This seems to indicate that
ergativity is a recent development in Hurrian.70
This is the point of view developed by Margaret
Khačikjan, one of Diakonoff’s students. According to her, as cited in Wegner (2007:33), the
Babylonian form (or “dialect”) of Hurrian seems to be the most archaic representative, and it
displays the ergative tendencies of the northern “dialects” to a much weaker extent. Speiser
(1941:108) had preferred the word Agentive “in order not to imply a definite parallelism [with
the Ergative of the Caucasic grammars] before it has been demonstrated beyond all doubt.”
At this time, other relationships within a sentence were indicated by means of particles.
These particles later became integrated into the declensional system, though their original status
as independent particles is still clear by their positioning (cf. Bush 1964:119). As shown in the
discussion immediatedly following the presentation of the case formatives in Hurrian, many of
these particles have parallels in Indo-European. We can envision an earlier period characterized
by an active structure similar to what is assumed to have existed in the earliest Proto-Indo-
European, thus:
Case Animate Inanimate
Inactive (> Absolutive) -Ø
Active (> Ergative) -s
Patient (> “Accusative”) -n
69
This is not at all unusual. As noted by Dixon (1994:6): “Many languages have some accusative and some
ergative characteristics.” He further notes (1994:224): “Some languages are fully accusative but many (perhaps
about one quarter of the languages of the world) show some ergative characteristics. No language has so far been
reported that is fully ergative; that is, having an exclusively ergative system of intra-causal marking on core
arguments, and also an exclusively S/O pivot for inter-causal operations such as coordination and subordination.”
Dixon’s entire book is devoted to providing a full survey of both morphological and syntactic ergativity. Especially
interesting is his discussion of how an accusative-type system can change into an ergative-type one and vice versa.
70
The situation in Hurrian is reminiscent of what Fortescue (1998:103) describes for the Uralo-Siberian languages,
especially Chukchi-Kamchatkan: “The lack of a case marking distinction between nominative and accusative (or at
least a limited use of accusative marking) is an areal trait of the non-Altaic Siberian region (including Nivkh). This
cuts across the distinction between nominative-accusative and ergative languages — thus Itelmen (nominative-
accusative) and Chukchi (ergative) both have an absolutive case. Two possible historical explanations suggest
themselves: either an older accusative marker (e.g. *-m) was lost in most of the modern languages (as in some
Samoyedic), or the proto-language lacked the distinction too and the accusative marker, where found, is an
innovation. The latter (minority) opinion is voiced by Raun (1998, 558) as regards Uralic. In 3.2 we saw that there
is good reason to believe that the ergative Chukuotkan languages developed from a nominative-accusative stage still
reflected in Itelmen.”
4. Nominal Morphology 41
In Hurrian, nominal forms are indicated by the addition of a thematic vowel to the root —
this vowel can be lost when certain endings are added. The most common vowel was -i-/-e-, but
both -a- and (rarely) -u- were also found (cf. Bush 1964:103—104). According to Wilhelm
(2004a:104), the only function of the thematic vowel -i- seems to have been to nominalize the
root, while the thematic vowel -a- was found on kinship terms, some divine names, and a few
other words. Bush (1964:104) notes that the thematic vowels were subject to frequent elision or
assimilation. Such patterning may have existed in early Proto-Indo-European as well. We may
speculate that the the original patterning was disrupted by new prosodic features developed in
early Proto-Indo-European (for a discussion of the role of accentuation in different stages of the
Indo-European parent language, cf. Lehmann 2002:202—208, who suggests a strong stress
accent as the probable cause of quantitative vowel gradation and for the development of the
syllabic allophones of the resonants [see also Burrow 1973:108—113; Brugmann 1904:138—
150]). The thematic vowels *-e/o- of traditional Proto-Indo-European appear to be a later
development.
The original function of the nominal thematic vowels may have been as follows: *-i (and
perhaps *-u) was used to mark the subject in active constructions, while *-a was used to mark:
(1) the direct object in active constructions; (2) the subject in stative constructions; and (3) the
so-called “status indeterminatus”. Neither Proto-Indo-European nor Hurrian retained the original
patterning. In both, the earlier system was superseded by one based upon the case formatives
discussed above.
Thus, we can see that the core of both the Indo-European and the Hurrian case systems
was identical. Later changes in each greatly expanded the number of case formatives, though
each developed along different lines.
The Hurrian Case Markers and Indo-European Parallels
There are important parallels between the Hurrian case markers given in the above tables
and Indo-European (where possible, the Hurrian material is cited in the form given in Friedrich
1969a:14):
1. Hurrian Absolutive plural marker -lla: This may not be a morpheme proper but, rather, a
deictic stem. Note the Proto-Indo-European demonstrative pronoun stem *H÷ol- ‘that over
there, that yonder’. It occurs in: Latin (later variants of ollus, etc.) ille, illa, illud ‘that’, ōlim
‘at that time’, ole, olle, ollus, olus, olla ‘that’, ultrā (< *oltrād) ‘beyond, on the far side,
farther’; Umbrian ulo, ulu ‘there, at that place’; Old Church Slavic lani (< *ol-nei) ‘last year’
(cf. Pokorny 1959:24—26 *al-, *ol- ‘beyond’). The initial i- found in the later Latin forms
ille, illa, illud is usually explained as due to the influence of is ‘that’. This deictic stem may
be preserved in Hurrian in the 3rd person plural Absolutive enclitic personal pronoun -l(la),
-lle, from which it spread to the nominal declension. Another possible explanation is that
-lla may simply be the remnant of an old collective/plural marker, in which case there is
nothing comparable in Indo-European. The geminate -lla- can be explained as -Hla-, parallel
to -Hn- ~ -n-.
42 4. Nominal Morphology
2. Hurrian plural marker -(a)š (cf. Bush 1964:114—115; Friedrich 1969a:14): In Indo-
European, the Nominative plural athematic ending was *-es, and the thematic form was *-ōs
(contracted from *-o-es) (cf. Fortson 2004:113 and 115; Szemerényi 1996:160). Note that, in
Hurrian, most of the plural case endings are built upon the plural marker -(a)ś, to which the
singular case endings have been added. In Proto-Indo-European, a plural marker *-s is added
after the endings: Acc. plural *-n+s/*-‚+s; Abl.-Dat. plural *-bh(y)o+s, *-mo+s; Instr.
plural *-bhi+s, *-mi+s, *-ōi+s (these are Szemerényi’s reconstructions [1996:160]).
3. Hurrian Ergative singular marker -š (*[s] according to Ugaritic): Note the Proto-Indo-
European Nominative singular athematic ending *-s, thematic *-os (cf. Fortson 2004:113—
114; Szemerényi 1996:160 and 186). For a discussion of the prehistoric development of this
ending in Proto-Indo-European, cf. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1995.I:233—244. We may note
here that, according to Beekes (1985:192), the Nominative singular in *-os was originally an
Ergative.
4. Hurrian “Accusative” singular -n(i), -ne: In Proto-Indo-European, the Accusative singular
ending was (athematic) *-m/*-i, (thematic) *-o-m (cf. Fortson 2004:113; Sihler 1995:248;
Szemerényi 1996:160 and 186). Examples include: (Acc. sg.) *dónt-i ‘tooth’ (cf. Sanskrit
dántam; Greek “ όντα; Latin dentem), *péd-i ‘foot’ (cf. Sanskrit pZdam; Greek πό α; Latin
pedem), and *wDk¦om ‘wolf’ (cf. Sanskrit v1kam; Greek ον; Latin lupum). In a number
of daughter languages (Greek, Gothic, and Hittite, for example), final *-m > *-n: Greek
(Acc. sg.) lππον ‘horse’ (cf. Sanskrit áśvam; Latin equum); Gothic (Acc. sg.) hanan ‘cock’ (<
*χananun); Hittite (Acc. sg.) at-ta-an ‘father’. The Accusative plural ending was (athematic)
*-ns/*-‚s, (thematic) *-o-ns (Burrow 1973:236—237; Fortson 2004:113; Sihler 1995:248):
*péd-‚s (cf. Sanskrit pad-ás; Greek πό ας; Latin pedēs); *wDk¦ons (cf. Sanskrit v1kān(s);
Greek ους [< *-ονς, still preserved in Cretan and Argolian]; Latin lupōs; Gothic wulfans).
5. Hurrian Genitive singular -we (*[w] according to Ugaritic; -we or -ú-e in Cuneiform)
(Friedrich 1969a:14 writes -„e) (< *-u+i; the -w- represents the pre-vocalic form of the
thematic vowel *u): Though the usual Proto-Indo-European Genitive singular thematic
ending is reconstructed as *-es/-os (cf. Burrow 1973:233; Fortson 2004:113; Szemerényi
1996:186), Italic, Venetic, and Celtic point to earlier *-ī (< *-iH) instead. *-ī is added
directly to the stem, without thematic vowel. No satisfactory explanation has been given for
the origin of this ending. Perhaps it represents a relic form.
6. Hurrian Dative singular -wa (-wa or -ú-a in Cuneiform) (Friedrich 1969a:14 writes -„a) (<
*-u+a; the -w- represents the pre-vocalic form of the thematic vowel *u): In Proto-Indo-
European, the Dative singular is usually reconstructed as athematic *-ei, thematic *-ōi (<
*-o-ei). In Old Hittite, however, there is a Directive singular ending in -a. This was
formerly thought to be a Dative. Though there have been attempts to derive this ending from
earlier *-ōi (< *-o-ei), none of the explanations offered to date is convincing. Rather, this is
best seen as a relic form preserved in Hittite but lost elsewhere throughout Indo-European.
Though common in Old Hittite, the directive merged with the Dative-Locative in -i in later
Hittite and in the other Anatolian languages.
7. Hurrian allative singular -da (Friedrich 1969a:14 calls this “directive”): Compare Proto-
Indo-European *d»/*dk ‘to, towards; from’ found in: Hittite enclitic particle -t/da; Latin -do
in quan-dō ‘when; when?’, en-do ‘into’, dē ‘down from, away from’; Old Irish do, du ‘to’, de
‘from’; Old English tō ‘to’; Old Church Slavic do ‘up to, until’. More forms from the
4. Nominal Morphology 43
daughter languages can be found in Pokorny 1959:181—183 *de-, *do- demonstrative
stem/base of various particles. It may be noted that the Tocharian A allative singular ending
is -ac. The -c is usually derived from the Proto-Indo-European particle *d»/*dk ‘to, towards;
from’ under discussion here.
8. Hurrian Instrumental singular -ae (< *-a+He): Szemerényi (1996:160 and 186) reconstructs
the Proto-Indo-European Instrumental singular athematic as *-e/-o and the thematic as *-ē/-ō.
Burrow (1973:232) derives the latter from *-eH÷/-oH÷, as does Fortson (2004:113).
9. Hurrian comitative singular -ra: Note the Proto-Indo-European conjunctive particle *Húer/
*Hú3 (> *ar/*3) ‘and, also’ found in: Tocharian B ra ‘also’; Greek Tñá, Pñ, ¼á, Wñá ‘then,
straightway, at once’; Lituanian i9 ‘and; too, also’, a9 ‘whether, or’; Latvian ar ‘with; also’.
10. Hurrian Ablative-Instrumental -n(i), -n(e): One of the salient characteristics of Indo-
European noun morphology is the heteroclitic declension. Here, the Nominative-Accusative
singular is characterized by *-r-, while the other cases are characterized by *-n-. This
declensional type is quite productive in Hittite, but it is in decline in the other daughter
languages. A single example will suffice to illustrate the general patterning: Hittite Nom.-
Acc. sg. e-eš-¯ar, e-eš-¯a-ar, iš-¯ar ‘blood’, but Gen. sg. iš-¯a-na-aš; Sanskrit Nom.-Acc.
sg. ás0k ‘blood’, but Gen. sg. asnás. It appears that the *-n- forms derive from an earlier
“oblique-n”, itself derived from the coalescence of still earlier endings: Genitive *-nu,
Dative *-na, and Locative *-ni.
11. Absolutive -i: The Hurrian-Hittite bilingual reveals a huge number of Absolutives being
used with no case marker but with Locative meaning. This suggests that the Proto-Indo-
European Locative ending *-i may originate in a functional reinterpretation of *-i. This
would also explain why this case marker only appears in the singular in Proto-Indo-
European.
12. Elidable -i in allai ‘lady’, attai ‘father’, uštai ‘hero’ which only appears in the Absolutive
and Ergative cases of words related to persons. Wilhelm (2004:105) calls this elidable -i an
“Honorificum” -i. This seems to be the nominalizer -i applied to (baby-talk) appellatives:
alla, atta, šäna, äla. Uštai is the only word that does not display the -aCa- phonetics. It is
unclear if the word nära ‘mother’ takes the elidable -i — note the case of šäni ‘brother’ but
šän-a-b ‘your brother’, where -a- is unexpected.71
This morpheme can be compared with the
Proto-Indo-European Vocative ending *-e of thematic stems, found, for example, in: Latin
lup-e; Greek -ε; Lithuanian vilk-è; Old Church Slavic vlъč-e.
Ergativity in Hurrian
In Hurrian, there is no case marker for the Absolutive: <E-er-bi ma-a-an-nu-u> (Kbo
32.14 Vo IV) ‘A dog it is not’. Here, erbi ‘dog’ bears no marker.
The case marker for the Ergative in Hurrian is -š, and the object apparently remains
unmarked: <a-a-i [...] pa-a-pa-an-ni [...] i-ti-la-a-an-ni Te-eš-šu-u-pa-aš> (adapted from Kbo
32.14 Ro 1) ‘May Teššup destroy the mountain’. Teššub is signaled as the subject by -š and
71
This may be a solution to the proximity of *šänai-wwu => šani-wwu ‘my brother’ and *šänai-b => šana-b ‘your
brother’, where the spirantization of -b causes a risk of homophony. It is possible that äli/äla ‘sister’ has the same
feature, but attestations are too limited.
44 4. Nominal Morphology
papan-ni ‘the mountain’ has no marker. In general, in the Hurro-Hittite bilingual discovered in
1983, words appearing in the Ergative case are persons, but inanimate objects like papan
‘mountain’ or kaballi ‘copper’ are also attested in the Ergative case. One of the most intriguing
sentences is this one, where the subject is unexpectedly in the Absolutive case: <m
Me-e-ki-ne-e
ti-bé-na d
IM-ub-u-ta; ku-un-zi-ma-i ka4-ti-ya> (Kbo 32.15 Vo IV 12—13) ‘Meki the words
toward Teššub kneeling says’. Meki, a person, is not marked in the Ergative case, in spite of
being the subject. The verb kadi ‘to say’ has, nevertheless, an explicit object tiwe-na ‘the
words’. There are several examples of this construction. But anyway, words do not kneel, and
they do not speak; only Meki would kneel and speak. Hurrian seems to dispense with grammar
when possible. Another item is <e-la wa-a¯-ru-ša da-a-an-ti-ib [...] d
A-al-la-a-ni> KBo 32.13 Ro
I 12-13 ‘A feast magnificent did the goddess Allani organize’. The verb is transitive (-i-b), but
the subject bears no Ergative case marker. Speiser himself in (1941:108) had noticed that the
“Agentive” suffix was sometimes dispensed with, as in <e-en-na-aš> KUB XXV 42 v 6, where
<e-en-na-aš-šu-uš> is expected, which accounts for his reservations about Hurrian being an
Ergative language. On the whole, this can also “reflects the effort which Hurrian made to keep
the subject in the forefront of the utterance”, as noted by Speiser (1941:206). To some extent,
this means that the case-markers mainly confirm the grammatical functions of the words, which
are expected from their relative positions in the sentence.
As already mentioned, the object is usually unmarked, even when it refers to an animate,
like a ‘deer’ <na-a-li>: <na-a-li u-ul-bi-i-ni pa-pa-an-ni ¯a-pa-a-na-ab> ‘the deer (to) the other
mountain moved’ (Kbo 32.14 Ro I 2—3), where nali ‘deer’ is subject, can be compared with
<ku-ut-te na-a-li ke-e-bé-él-la-a-šu-uš> ‘may the hunters fell the deer’ (Kbo 32.14 Ro I), where
nali is object, with no formal change.
So it seems that the case is closed and that Hurrian is an Ergative language, and it should
not have an Accusative case at the same time. But then, some sentences seem to contradict this.
For example, in the Mitanni letter, Mit. I 114—115:
114. I [Gi]-li-i-an [pa-aš]-ši-i-it-¯i-ib-wə I [Ma-ni]-en-na-a-an [pa-aš]-ši-i-it-¯i-ib
Giliium ambactum meum Maninam ambactum tuum
115. [na]-ak-ku-ša-a-ú ú-ú-na-a-al-la-a-an še-e-ni-ib-wə-ta
missi veniendos ad fratrem meum.
The ending -an is usually translated as ‘and’, mainly because the standard approach of
ergativity is that it should exclude an Accusative. Is this not a clear case of Accusative, with
both Gilia and Mani being in the Accusative singular and the participle of the verb una- ‘to
come’ being in the Accusative plural -alla-a-an? The translation made by Wilhelm abides by
the option that -an is ‘and’:72
‘And Gilia, my envoy, and Mani, your envoy, I sent them and they
are coming to my brother’. But here, this translation seems to miss something of the real
structure of that sentence, where the Accusative marker is elegantly reconnecting Gilia, Mani,
and the verb una- in the next line. Another intriguing case of reconnection by the Accusative
marker is this sentence from Mit. IV 33—34:
72
In French in Moran (1987:141).
4. Nominal Morphology 45
- <aš-ti-i-in še-ni-ib-wu-ú-e>
‘The wife of my brother’
- <a-ru-u-ša-ú še-e-ni-ib-wu-ú-e-ni-e-en tiš-ša-a-an-na ši-ra-aš-še>
‘I gave [who] is so pleasant to the heart of my brother’.
These phenomena are not described in the existing literature. In both cases, there is a
non-finite verbal form in the sentence, and the Accusative marker seems to be used to make sure
that this verbal form is not interpreted as referring to the subject but as referring to the object.
Another intriguing sentence with a double Accusative is: Mit. II 11 <un-du-ma-a-an še-
e-ni-ib-wu-ú-e-en aš-ti a-ru-u-ša-ú> ‘and now, I gave my brother a wife’. Another extraordinary
example with a double subject is: Mit. II 49 <še-e-ni-ib-we-e-en at-ta-ar-ti-ib-wə-tan tiš-ša-an-
na-ma-an an-zu-an-nu-u-¯u-ša-a-ú> ‘I and many things from my fathers have rejoiced my
brother’. In these sentences, because of <-ma-(a)-an>, the ending -e-en cannot be interpreted as
meaning ‘and’. Speiser (1941:167—175) devotes ten pages to a discussion of the suggestion that
the particle -n may, indeed, be the case marker of the Accusative. Several sentences are listed as
examples, but Speiser (1941:169) does not discuss the above sentence (Mit. I 114—115).
Ultimately, Speiser concludes that ‘no decision can be reached’.
Our proposal would be to classify the Hurrian case markers in a hierarchy of optionality.
The Ergative marker -š is the first to be expressed. The Accusative marker -n is most often
dispensed with, but it can be resorted to if the balance of the sentence makes it necessary.
What is illustrated with a sentence such as <m
Me-e-ki-ne-e ti-bé-na d
IM-ub-u-ta; ku-un-
zi-ma-i ka4-ti-ya> (Kbo 32.15 Vo IV 12—13) ‘Meki the words toward Teššub kneeling says’ is
that there must have been a certain amount of fluidity in Old Hurrian. Another example of a
word inserted with no case marker is <m
Me-e-ki pé-é-bé ti-ša-ab : a-na-aš-ti-ik-ki> KBo 32.15
Ro I 20'—21' ‘Meki, your heart of yours does [will]73
not rejoice’.
Traditional Reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European Nominal Morphology
The older Indo-European daughter languages (Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Gothic, Old Church
Slavic, etc.) have rich and complex inflectional morphologies. According to the traditional
(“Neogrammarian”) reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European nominal morphology, the following
are posited:
1. Eight cases: Nominative, Vocative, Accusative, Genitive, Ablative, Dative,
Instrumental, and Locative;
2. Three numbers: singular, dual, and plural;
3. Three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter.
Szemerényi (1996:160), for example, reconstructs the following case endings for Proto-Indo-
European (see also Fortson 2004:104—107 and 113; Clackson 2007:92—100; Brugmann
1904:373—399):
73
The Hittite translation <tu-uš-ke-ez-zi> has the future tense, but Hurrian has the Present tense.
46 4. Nominal Morphology
Case Singular Dual Plural
Nominative *-s, *-Ø
*-e, *-ī/*-i
Vocative *-Ø
Accusative *-m/*-i *-ns/*-‚s
Genitive *-es/*-os/*-s *-om/*-ōm *-ous (?), *-ōs (?)
Ablative *-es/*-os/*-s; *-ed/*-od
Dative *-ei
Instrumental *-e/*-o; *-bhi, *-mi *-eis; *-bhis, *-mis
Locative *-i *-su *-ou
An important distinction is made between thematic stems (those ending in *-e/o-) and
athematic stems (those lacking a thematic vowel). There are also other differences depending
upon stem type, and several declension classes are, accordingly, recognized. This complexity
reflects what is found in Sanskrit. The remaining older Indo-European daughter languages
typically have fewer cases, and this has traditionally been thought to be due to loss on their part
from the more complex system typified by Sanskrit.
The athematic stems show an intraparadigmatic accent shift that is, at least partially,
correlated with changes in Ablaut. The accent falls on the stem in the so-called “strong” cases
(Nominative-Accusative-Vocative) but on the ending in the so-called “weak” cases (all others).
In thematic stems, on the other hand, the position of the accent typically remains fixed on the
same syllable (either on the root or the suffix) throughout the paradigm.
The thematic stems have a special paradigm for neuter stems (Nominative-Accusative
singular *-o-m [cf. Sanskrit yugám ‘yoke’]) and also a unique Ablative singular ending (*-ed/
*-od [cf. Sanskrit v1kād ‘wolf’). In the older non-Anatolian daughter languages, the thematic
stems have grown in importance — to the point that most of the athematic stems have been
replaced.
An important stem type is the so-called “heteroclitic” stems. They are characterized by
*-r- in the strong cases and *-n- in the weak cases, as exemplified by the Sanskrit word for
‘blood’: Nom.-Acc. sg. ás0k, but Gen. sg. asnás (note the change in the position of the accent as
well). This was an old stem type, productive in Hittite but moribund in the other daughter
languages.
The typical structure of inflected forms is root + suffix + inflectional ending.
Adjectives exist as a separate morphological category and agree in gender and number
with the nouns they modify. Three degrees of comparison (positive, comparative, superlative)
are traditionally reconstructed.
Finally, it should be noted that nominal composition played an important role in Proto-
Indo-European, and several different types of compounds are recognized. The inherited system
of nominal composition was greatly expanded in Sanskrit (for details, cf. Burrow 1973:208—
219).

4. Nominal Morphology 47
The Deep Foundations of Proto-Indo-European Nominal Morphology
Proto-Indo-European is traditionally assumed to have been a highly inflected language —
except for particles, conjunctions, and certain quasi-adverbial forms, all words were inflected.
The basic structure of inflected words was as follows: root + suffix (one or more) + inflectional
ending. A notable morphophonemic characteristic was the extensive use of a system of vocalic
alternations (“Ablaut” in German) as a means to mark morphological distinctions. Verbs were
strongly differentiated from nouns. For nouns and adjectives, three genders, three numbers, and
as many as eight cases were reconstructed (see above). The Neogrammarian reconstruction of
the Proto-Indo-European verbal system set up two voices, four moods, and as many as six tenses.
The discovery of Hittite and related Indo-European Anatolian languages (Palaic,
Cuneiform and Hieroglyphic Luwian, Lycian, Lydian, etc.) forced a reappraisal of the traditional
reconstruction. While manifestly Indo-European in its structure, Hittite cannot possibly be
derived from the form of Proto-Indo-European reconstructed by the Neogrammarians. For
example, while Hittite maintained most of the case endings traditionally reconstructed, at least in
the singular, Old Hittite also had a directive case. Moreover, Hittite lacks the dual number and
feminine gender. Instead of the three genders of traditional grammar, Hittite has a two-gender
system: common and neuter (sometimes called “animate” and “inanimate”, respectively). The
common gender corresponds to the masculine and feminine of traditional grammar. The plural is
less fully developed than the singular (cf. Fortson 2004:165). The heteroclitic stems are a highly
productive class. Recently, scholars have even claimed to have found traces of an Ergative-type
construction. Finally, it may be noted that Hittite lacks the complex nominal composition found
in the non-Anatolian daughter languages. In all aspects, Hittite appears to represent a more
archaic stage of development. This has led to the realization that (cf. Drinka 1995:4):
1. There is no basis for projecting all of the morphological complexity of Sanskrit and Greek
into Proto-Indo-European, as was done by the Neogrammarians. There is no sign of much
of this complexity outside the eastern area.
2. The simplicity of the Hittite morphological system represents archaism, to a large extent,
not loss, though, to be sure, innovations can be found in Hittite as well.
3. The distribution of morphological features across the Indo-European languages cannot be
accounted for by positing a unified proto-language, or even a proto-language that was
dialectally diverse on a single synchronic level. Rather, it must be admitted that Proto-
Indo-European was not a single entity in space or time and that the Indo-European
daughter languages developed from different chronological stages, that is, that they had
different points of departure from a dynamic proto-language.
The first main split in the Indo-European family was between the Anatolian branch and
the rest of the Indo-European daughter languages attested elsewhere in Eurasia. At the time of
this split, the feminine gender of later Proto-Indo-European had not yet come into being, and
there were only two gender classes: (1) “common” gender (animate) and (2) neuter (inanimate)
(cf. Lehmann 2002:65—67; Fortson 2004:103; Clackson 2007:104—111).
The following athematic case endings may be assumed to have existed in Proto-Indo-
European at the time that the Anatolian languages split off:
48 4. Nominal Morphology

Nominative *-s
Nominative-Accusative *-Ø

Dative-Locative *-ey/-i *-ey/-i
Plural:
Nominative-Vocative *-es (collective *-(e)Hú)
Nominative-Accusative
Genitive *-om *-om
The following thematic case endings may be reconstructed for the same period:
Case Common Neuter
Singular:
Nominative *-o-s
Nominative-Accusative *-o-m
Vocative *-e
Accusative *-o-m (or *-o-n)
Genitive *-o-s *-o-s

Directive (?) *-e/o
Plural:
Nominative-Vocative *-ōs (< *-o-es)
Nominative-Accusative *-e-Hú
Genitive *-ōm (< *-o-om) *-ōm (< *-o-om)
There have been several serious efforts to ascertain the salient characteristics of the
earliest form of the Proto-Indo-European morphological system — Lehmann refers to this period
as “Pre-Indo-European”. Until fairly recently, it was common to think in terms of ergativity. In
Ergative languages, the subjects of intransitive verbs and the direct objects of transitive verbs are
treated identically for grammatical purposes, while subjects of transitive verbs are treated
differently. This is what Kenneth Shields proposes, for example, in a number of works. Beekes
may be mentioned as another who suggests that Proto-Indo-European may have once had an
Ergative type system. However, the majority of Indo-Europeanists no longer consider ergativity
to have been a characteristic feature of the Proto-Indo-European morphological system at any
stage in its development, including Pre-Indo-European.
According to Lehmann (2002:185), three endings represent the most ancient layer in
Proto-Indo-European noun morphology and came to provide the basis for the development of the
4. Nominal Morphology 49
central case system; these endings are: *-s, *-m, and *-H (Lehmann writes *-h). Lehmann notes
that *-s indicated an individual and, when used in clauses, identified the agent; *-m used in
clauses indicated the target; and *-H supplied a collective meaning. Other relationships within a
sentence were indicated by means of particles. The extensive case system reconstructed for
Proto-Indo-European by the Neogrammarians was a much later development and was the result
of an expansion of an originally limited core of basic case formants.
Thus, following Lehmann, the following case forms may be assumed to have existed in
Proto-Indo-European at the earliest recoverable stage of development:
Case Common Neuter
Nominative -s
Accusative -m
Nominative-Accusative -m / -Ø
A deeper stage of development is investigated later in this book. It bears repeating that
other relationships within a sentence were indicated by means of particles during the earliest
period of development and that the case formatives traditionally reconstructed for Proto-Indo-
European were later developments.

Pronouns, Numerals,
Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs
Hurrian Personal Pronouns
Hurrian had a set of possessive suffixes as well as a series of independent and enclitic
personal pronouns.
The independent and enclitic stems were as follows:
SINGULAR First Person Second Person Third Person
Absolutive ište *[isti:] be *[bi:] mane, mani, -nna
Accusative (enclitic) -at(ta)74
-am(ma)75

Locative
Allative šuta *[su:da]
Ablative manutan
Comitative šura *[su"ura] manura
Equative manuunna
Note: The alternation between <w> <m> and <b> may be only graphemic, and the underlying
morpheme is probably /b/ [w, b]. As noted by Thureau-Dangin, the Semitic word awat can be
written awat, abat, or even amat in late cuneiform.
74
This unexpected form is probably from the assimilation of the Old Hurrian -d- (P3) with -w- (P1), hence -tt-.
75
This may be from -d- (P3) and -b- (P2), with a dissimilation into -mm- to avoid confusion with P1 -tt-. The
resulting distribution of -m- and -t- is the exact opposite of what is found Proto-Indo-European.

The “verb” mann- <ma-a-an-nV-> ‘(there) to be’ takes the enclitic pronouns:
- mann-atta ‘I am’ Mit. III 63, 65
- mann-amma ‘you (sg.) are’ Mit. III 10
- mann-i ‘he/she/it is’ Mit. IV 107
- mann-atilla ‘we are’ Mit. IV 109
- *mann-abba ‘you (pl.) are’ (not attested in the Mitanni letter)
- mann-alla ‘they are’ Mit. I 109
This “verb” is the same word as the pronoun mane used in a particular construction:
- mani80
<ma-a-ni> ‘he/she/it (Abs)’
- mann-u <ma-a-an-nu-u> ‘he/she/it is not’
- mann-ukku (negative impersonal) ‘no’ (litterally ‘Ø is not’)
- mann-ubur <ma-a-an-nu-u-bur> ‘this is not’ (emphatic form ?) KBo 32:14 I 17
This has been recognized by Speiser (1941:86—87): “The assumption of two
independent stems is discouraged by the orthography, which treats both sets of forms alike. Nor
is it favored by morphology, in that manni betrays its independence [from real verbs] by
dispensing with the normal intransitive suffix -a.” And also: “This use points to a periphrastic
function of man(n)- which accords well with a verb meaning ‘to be’.”
The negation is expressed with the insertion of -ukk-: mann-ukk-alla ‘they are not’.
Most negative forms are not attested.
Adjectives used as predicates do not require any copula:
<I
Ma-ni-en-na-ma-an pa-aš-ši-i-it-¯i-ib ni-i-ri tiš-ša-an> Mit. II 86
‘And Mani, your envoy, [is] good very much.’
79
Probably from the assimilation of -ll- ‘plural’ and *-b ‘P2sg’.
80
Oblique cases are built on <ma-a-nu-> with -u- as it occurs for most pronouns.
5. Pronouns, Numerals, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs 53
It can also be noted that the Ergative case marker -š is dispensed with when suffixed by
the enclitic Accusative pronouns:
- iša-lla- ‘I (verb) them’ Mit. III 54
- seni-wwu-tta ‘my brother (verb) me’ Mit. II 50
- <d
Ši-mi-i-gi-ni-e-ti-la-an> ‘the god Šimigi (may love) us’ Mit. I 77
With these enclitic Accusative pronouns, the Ergative marker is made redundant. But it
is kept when both the subject and the object are the 3rd person:
- seni-wwu-šš-a-an ‘and my brother (verb) him’ Mit. III 1
The enclitic pronouns can also be suffixed to the adverbs and conjunctions that appear at
the beginning of the sentence, or to numbers and, of course, to verbs:
- inu-tta-nin ‘How me (my brother loves now)’ Mit. I 74
- ai-lla-an ‘If them (...)’ Mit. II 75
- tumni-lla ‘the four (ones)’
- <a-ru-la-ú-un-na> ‘I (will) bring it’ KBo 32.15 Vo IV 15
- <d
A-al-la-ni-ma ta-a-ti-ya-aš-ši d
IM-up-pa-ma : tap-ša-a-¯a mé-e-¯a> KBo 32.13 Ro
28—29 ‘The goddess Allani, who loves him, toward Teššub as an échanson is standing’.
Sometimes, the enclitic pronoun does not appear in the clause to which it belongs, as in
the following paragraph in KBo 32. 15 Vo IV:
- < 7. ti-wu-uš-¯i-ni ¯a-ši-im-ma m
Me-e-ki-né-ella >
- < 8. a-li-nu-um (:) “u-u¯-ni m
Me-e-ki” i-ši-ik-ku-un-na >
‘7. And Meki, hearing the order, about them (?) [suffixed to Meki] 8. whining: ‘woe on
Meki’, said he. The structure of the sentence is all the stranger as -lla is plural but tiwuš¯ini is
singular, and both verbal forms alinu- and išikku- are intransitive. One hypothesis would be that
the rationale for this component is to rhyme with the next line (?).
The enclitic pronouns are sometimes pleonastically suffixed. This is attested in the
Hurrian-Hittite bilingual and in the Mitanni letter:
- <a-ma-at-te-na e-en-na d

It can also be noted that the Ergative case marker is dispensed with three times.

‘And thus me Tadu-¯eba has heard me’
Obviously, the enclitic pronouns are an easy device to fill dactylic hexameters. It can
also be noted that Tadu-¯eba was probably pronounced *[tadu-xpá], otherwise the verse has an
extra syllable.
The possessive suffixes were added to nouns or nominalized verbs. They were as
follows:
SINGULAR First Person Second Person Third Person
Word final -wwe *[-wí] -b *[-b] -a
If not final -wwu- *[-wú] -be- *[-bí] -(y)i-
PLURAL First Person Second Person Third Person
Word final
-wwaś *[wáź]
-śśi81
-yaś *[-jaź]
If not final -
śśu
The possessive suffixes are suffixed to the Absolutive case of nouns, and the words with
elidable -i keep it.
Examples: (1) šeni ‘brother’: šeniwwu- ‘my brother’, šena-b ‘your brother’, šena- ‘his brother’;
(2) attai ‘father’: attaiwwu- ‘my father’, attaibu- ‘your father’, attayi- ‘his father’, attaiwwaś
‘our fathers’; (3) ¯arra- ‘his road’; (4) umini ‘country’: uminiwwe ‘my country’, uminiwwuwa
‘to my country’, uminib ‘your country’, uminiwaś ‘our country’, uminiyaś ‘their country’; (5) eni
‘god’: enaš <e-en-na-aš> ‘his god (Erg)’; (6) <e-te-šu-ú-ta> ‘to yourselves, to your body (Dir)’,
ulme-śśi ‘your weapon(s ?)’.
The possessive suffixes are not prosodically enclitic, though suffixed. They are attested
with plene writing: *[-wú-], *[-bí-], [-wáź-]. Only the third person suffixes were unaccented.
The possessive suffixes were added to the Nominative of the word which seems to retain its
original accent. Prosodically, bases and possessive suffixes behave as independent units.
When compared with the possessive suffixes, the independent pronouns are identical for
the second person: the base is */b/ to which case markers and the plural are added. However,
for the first person, the situation is more complex: the common morpheme is */uw/, which can
also be found as a verbal ending. This morpheme seem to be added to */su"-/. As for the plural,
it appears to be the pluralization of a base */sat-/, which also appears in the singular <ište>.
Speiser (1941:28 and 68) proposes an interesting analysis of this base */sat-/. Mit. IV 62 has
<ša-[at]-ta-a-al-la-] ‘them together’, where -lla- is ‘them’. Speiser follows Thureau-Dangin (RA
81
“nicht bezeugt” (“not attested”) according to Diakonoff (1971:93). But these forms are now attested in the Hittite-
Hurrian bilingual.

36 [1939]:23), who had previously analyzed <ša-at-ti-la> Mâri 6.13 as ‘we together’. This
means that this base šat- has nothing to do with P1. This analysis is confirmed by the following
sentence in KBo 32.13 Ro I 9-10:
- <d
IM-ub ša-at-ta ¯a-mu-u-ra šu-úr-ru-ú >
- <ti-me-er-re-e e-še-ni du-ú-ri >
‘9. Teššub together with Àamu82
went 10. (to) the dark ground below’.
The underlying Proto-Hurrian personal pronouns are:
First Person Second Person
Singular *i *bi
Plural *i-lla *bi-lla
Hurrian Personal Pronouns and Indo-European Parallels
Turning to Indo-European, we find the following (the Hurrian material is cited in the
form given in Laroche’s Glossaire and Friedrich 1969a):
1. Hurrian first person singular personal pronoun stem: Absolutive singular (ište) and Ergative
singular (išaš). It is clear that the stem here is iš- (Diakonoff—Starostin 1986:81 reconstruct
a common Hurro-Urartian *"ez-) to which case endings have been added. Perhaps a further
analysis is possible — the stem may, in fact, be a compound: *i+šu. šu, in turn, is none
other than the stem found in the other cases: Gen. sg. šowe, Dat. sg. šowe, Allat. sg. šuta,
Comit. sg. šura, Equat. sg. šonna. In Proto-Indo-European, the paradigm of the first person
personal pronoun is also suppletive — the Nominative singular has one stem, while the
remaining cases are built on an entirely different stem (*me-). The evidence from the
daughter languages points to several possible reconstructions for the first person personal
pronoun (Nom. sg.): *H÷eĝ (cf. Gothic ik); *H÷eĝoH (cf. Latin ego; Greek dãþ); *H÷eĝoHm
(cf. Homeric dãþí; Laconian dãþíç); *H÷eĝhom (cf. Sanskrit ahám; Avestan azəm); *H÷e$
(cf. Latvian es; Lithuanian àš [Old Lithuanian eš]; Armenian es); *H÷eĝom (cf. Old Church
Slavic azъ). This seems to indicate that this stem is a relatively late formation (though old
enough to be represented in Hittite) and that it is composed of several deictic elements strung
together. The first element is *H÷e-, to which *$- or *ĝ- or *ĝh- has been added, followed by
*-oH or *-om (this analysis was first proposed by Karl Brugmann). It is the first element
(*H÷e-) that may be compared with Hurrian *i- (< *H÷e-), the form extracted above from the
analysis of iš- as *i+šu.
2. Hurrian second person personal pronoun stem we- ‘you’ (Friedrich 1969a:15 writes *„e-):
Compare the Proto-Indo-European second person personal pronoun stem *we(-s)-/*wo(-s)-,
82
«Àamu serait un autre nom de Tašmišu, frère et conseiller avisé de Teššub» in Catsanicos (1996:226). Cf. Haas,
V. (1996:332 and 473).
56 5. Pronouns, Numerals, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs
(reduced-grade) *u(-s)- in: Sanskrit Acc.-Dat.-Gen. pl. vas, Acc.-Dat.-Gen. dual vām ‘you’;
Latin Nom.-Acc. pl. vōs, Gen. pl. vestrum, Dat.-Abl. pl. vōbīs ‘you’; Old Church Slavic
Nom.-Acc. dual va, Nom.-Acc. pl. vy ‘you’. Reduced-grade in: Greek Nom. pl. › εsς (also
¡ììåò), Acc. pl. ¡ììå (also › Ýáς) (< *us-me) ‘you’. Perhaps also found in Proto-Indo-
European in the second person Gen. sg. personal pronoun *té-we ‘your’ (that is, *té+we)
found, for example, in: Sanskrit Gen. sg. táva ‘your’; Avestan Gen. sg. tava ‘your’; this
element is also found in the Acc. sg. *t(e)+wé (> *twé) and Abl. sg. *t(e)+w-ét (> *twét) (cf.
Burrow 1973:266; Sihler 1995:374 [paradigms 372—373]; Rasmussen 1987).
3. Hurrian third person (Abs. sg. indep.) mane, mani, (encl.) -me, -ma ‘he, she, it’: This may be
compared with an old Proto-Indo-European demonstrative stem *mo- ‘this, that’ preserved
only in relic forms in Celtic but (apparently) lost elsewhere: Welsh ýma (poetical ýman)
‘here’; Breton ma, man̄ ‘here’; Cornish ma ‘here’. Hurrian also has yame-, yeme- ‘any’
(equivalent to Hittite kuitki ‘whatever, anything, everything’ [= Latin quidque], Akkadian
minummê ‘whatever, anything, all’) a derivative of ya, ye ‘that, which’.
4. Hurrian third person (Abs. sg. encl.) -n(na): This may be related to the Hurrian definite
article (< anaphoric suffix), singular -ne, plural -na discussed above.
5. Hurrian second person (Abs. encl.) -m(ma): In Proto-Indo-European, there are two suffixal
elements that are added to the first and second person personal pronoun stems, both in the
singular and the plural; they are: *-we and *-me. Examples include: (a) first person: Acc.
sg. *m(e)+me (> *me), Gen. sg. *me+me; Acc. dual *‚H÷+we; Acc. pl. *‚s+me, Dat. pl.
*‚s+m-ei, Abl. pl. *‚s+m-et; (b) second person: Acc. sg. *t(e)+we, Gen. sg. *te+we; Acc.
dual *uH÷+we; Acc. pl. *us+me, Dat. pl. *us+m-ei, Abl. pl. *us+m-et (for details, cf. Sihler
1995:369—375). These elements are found in other pronoun types as well. Neither their
origin nor their meaning is known, and opinions differ concerning their original distribution
in the paradigms of the individual pronouns in the Indo-European parent language. Even so,
their resemblance to the Hurrian Absolutive forms of the second person personal pronoun is
striking: (independent) we, (enclitic) -m(ma).
Other Hurrian Pronouns
Hurrian had the following demonstrative, indefinite, relative, and interrogative pronouns:
a) Demonstrative: anni ‘this’; andi ‘that’:
<an-ti ta-a-¯i> = Hitt. <a-pa-a-aš LÚ-aš> ‘this man’ KBo 32.14 Ro I 18
b) Indefinite: uli, ulbi, ulwi ‘other’; akki…aki ‘the one…the other’:
<u-ul-bi-i-ni pa-pa-an-ni> = Hitt. <ta-me-e-da-ni ÀUR.SAG-i> ‘the other mountain’
KBo 32.14 Ro I 2—3
<u-ul-wi-ne-e-(ma) [u]-um-mi-in-ni> = Hitt. <ta-me-e-da-ni KUR-ya> ‘the other
land’ KBo 32.14 Ro II 19
c) Indefinite: šui ‘all; everyone, everybody’:
Mit. I 71—3 < I
Ma-ni-e-el-la-ma-an pa-aš-ši-i-it-¯i-wu-uš wə-ru-u-ša-a-al-la-a-an
ma-a-na šu-e-ni ti-we-e-e-na ta-a-nu-ša-a-uš-še-na> ‘And Mani, them, your envoy
5. Pronouns, Numerals, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs 57
saw them, this83
, everything, the things that I did.’
Šui is often used with a demonstrative: <šu-e an-ti> Mit. I 57, <an-nu-dan šu-e-ni-e-
dan> Mit. III 108, <an-du-ú-e-e šu-e-ni-e-e> Mit. III 9.
Šui is frequently completed by -ni-, -nna- or -lla- ‘all the’.
d) Relative: ya/ye ‘who, which, what’, ya-ma- (sg), ya-lla- (pl):
Mit. III 57—59 <i-ša-aš e-e-ma-na-a-mu-ša-a-ú i-i-al-la-a-ni-i-in am-ma-ti-ib-wu-
ush at-ta-ib-wu-uš at-ta-i-ip-pa we-e-wə ma-ka-a-an-na gi-pa-a-nu-lu-uš-ta-a-
asš-še-na> ‘As for me, I have mutiplied ten times the gifts, which my grandfather, my
father has profusely placed (before) your father (and) you.’
All of these pronoun stems have possible parallels in Indo-European (the Hurrian
material is cited in the form given in Laroche’s Glossaire):
1. Hurrian demonstratives anni ‘this’; andi ‘that’ (Friedrich 1969a:16 writes anti-): We have
already noted above the following demonstrative pronoun stem in Proto-Indo-European:
*ne-, *no-; *H÷e-no-, *H÷o-no-.
2. Hurrian a(k)ku ‘other’ (Friedrich 1969a:16 writes agu-), akki…aki ‘the one…the other’. This
may be compared with Proto-Indo-European *Húet-k¦e ‘and on the other hand’, *Húet- ‘on
the other hand’, found in: Latin atque (usually before h and vowels), ac (usually before
consonants) ‘and, and also; and moreover, and even; and indeed, and so; and then, and
suddenly; and especially’, originally ‘and on the other hand’, at ‘but, moreover’; Greek Pτ- in
Pτ- ρ ‘but, yet’; Gothic aþ- in aþ-þan ‘but, however’.
3. Hurrian indefinite uli ‘other’: We discussed Proto-Indo-European *Hol- above. There is an
alternative stem, *Húel- (> *al-) (cf. Pokorny 1959:24—26 *al-, *ol-), that is the source of
the following: Latin alius ‘another, other, different’, alter ‘one of two; the one…the other’;
Old Irish aile ‘other’; Greek Tëëïò ‘another; one besides’; Gothic aljis ‘other’; Tocharian B
alyek ‘other, another’.
4. Hurrian indefinite šui ‘all; everyone, everybody’: Note here the Proto-Indo-European
demonstrative pronoun (< deictic particle [cf. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 119.1:336]) *so ‘this,
that’ found in: Sanskrit (m. sg.) sá(-­), (f. sg.) sā demonstrative pronoun; Greek (m. sg.) ¿,
(f. sg.) ½ demonstrative pronoun and definite article; Old Icelandic sá, sú ‘that’; Tocharian B
se(-) demonstrative pronoun. In Proto-Indo-European, the stems *so and *to- were combined
together in a single paradigm — *so was used in the Nom. sg., masculine and feminine,
while the Nom. sg. neuter and all of the other cases were built on *to- (cf. Burrow 1973:272).
In Indo-European, the indefinite pronouns are derived from the relative/interrogative pronoun
*k¦i-, *k¦o- ‘who, which, what’.
5. Hurrian relative ya/ye ‘who, which, what’ (Friedrich 1969a:16 writes iÔa- (iÔe-)): Compare
the Proto-Indo-European relative stem *H÷yo- ‘who, which’ found in: Greek ”ò, {, ”
‘which’; Phrygian éïò ‘which; this’; Sanskrit yá-­ ‘which’ (cf. Pokorny 1959:283 *Ôo-;
Fortson 2004:130 *Ôo- or *HÔo-; Szemerényi 1996:210 *yos, *yā, *yod).
83
Another idea would be: ‘there is’ or ‘that is to say’.
58 5. Pronouns, Numerals, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs
Hurrian Numerals
Wilhelm (2004a:115) lists the following numerals one through ten in Hurrian (see also
Friedrich 1969a:16; Bush 1964:108):
Cardinal Ordinal
1. šukki, šuga (?) (?)
2. šin(a) šinzi
3. kig(a) kiški (< *kik=ši)
4. tumni tumušše, tumunzi
5. nariy(a) narišše
6. šeže (?)
7. šindi šendešši
8. kira/i (?)
9. tamri/a (?)
10. eman emanzi, emašši (?)
There is nothing comparable in Indo-European other than a superficial resemblance of the
numeral šeže ‘six’ and Proto-Indo-European *s(w)e$s ‘six’. When the following Semitic forms
are considered, however, it is clear that the Hurrian numeral ‘six’ is a borrowing from Semitic
and, consequently, not related to the Proto-Indo-European numeral: Old Babylonian (m.) šiššet,
(f.) šiš(š); Akkadian (m.) šeššet, šiššet, (f.) šiššu; Hebrew (m.) šiššāh, (f.) šēš; Aramaic (f.) šîθ;
Arabic (m.) sittat, (f.) sitt.
Wilhelm (2004a:115) notes the following fractions: *ša/e¯t- ‘one-half’ and tumanzalli
‘one quarter of a shekel’. Hurrian *ša/e¯t- ‘one-half’ may be compared with the Proto-Indo-
European root *siHø- (> *sē-) found in: (1) *sē- ‘separately, apart’ (cf. Latin sēd, sē ‘without;
apart’); (2) *sē-t- ‘division, section’ (cf. Avestan hāiti- ‘division, section’; Latvian sę ta ‘hedge,
section, division, staff’; (3) *sē-mi- ‘half’ (cf. Sanskrit [indeclinable] sāmi ‘half, incompletely,
imperfectly, partially’; Greek [prefix] ½ - ‘half’; Latin [prefix] sēmi- ‘half’).
Another number is nubi ‘ten thousand’, and the suffix -gar- seems to be “dual”.
Hurrian Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs
The following Hurrian adpositions, conjunctions, and adverbs are attested (this material
is cited in the form given in Laroche’s Glossaire):
1. abi-n ‘before’ [+Dative] (from abi ‘the front part’)
2. abi-da ‘toward’ [+Directive] (from abi ‘the front part’)
3. adi ‘thus, so’
4. ai ‘when, if’ [followed by a syntagm]
5. anam(mi) ‘thus, therefore’ [used in correlation with inu(me)]
5. Pronouns, Numerals, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs 59
6. ayi-da, aye ‘in the presence of’
7. edi-da, edi-wa ‘for, because of’; edi-ye ‘concerning’ (from edi ‘body, person’)
8. ¯enni ‘now’
9. guru ‘anew, once again’
10. inna ‘when’
11. inu ‘how’
12. ma ‘and’
13. panu ‘although’
14. šummi ‘with’ (from the word šummi ‘hand’)
15. tiššan ‘very much’
16. tumwa ‘under’
17. undu ‘then, when’
18. wuri-da ‘in sight of’ (from wur- ‘to see’)
The following parallels with Indo-European may be noted:
1. Hurrian abi-n- ‘before’ and abi-da ‘toward’: Compare the Proto-Indo-European preposition
*H÷obhi ‘to, towards; in front of, before; beyond’ found in: Sanskrit abhí ‘to, towards’;
Gatha-Avestan aibī ‘to, unto, over’; Old Persian abiy ‘to, against, in addition to’; Old Church
Slavic obь ‘beyond’; Latin ob ‘in front of, before’.
2. Hurrian adi ‘thus, so’: Compare: Sanskrit ádh` ‘therefore, now, then; moreover, so much
the more; and, partly’, ádha…ádha ‘as much as; partly partly’; Avestan aδa ‘then, so’; Old
Persian ada- ‘then’.
3. Hurrian ai ‘when, if’: Note the following: Hittite enclitic particle -a ‘but’; Old Church
Slavic a ‘but, and’; Lithuanian õ ‘but’. According to Mann (1984—1987:1), these are to be
derived from Proto-Indo-European *ā ‘and, or, but’, while Puhvel (1984— .1/2:9—10) sees
them as adverbial forms of the pronominal stem *e-/*o-.
4. Hurrian guru ‘anew, once again’: Perhaps to be compared with the Proto-Indo-European
stem *k¦3t- found in: Welsh pryd (< *k¦3tu-) ‘time’; Oscan -pert in petiro-pert ‘four times’;
Sanskrit -k0t ‘…time(s)’ in sa-k1t ‘once’.
5. Hurrian ma ‘and’: Note the Hittite enclitic particle -ma ‘however, but, and’. This particle is
also found in the other Anatolian languages: Palaic -ma (meaning uncertain); Lydian enclitic
-m; Lycian stressed particle me. This has been compared with Greek (Thessalian) = έ
‘but’.
6. Hurrian šummi ‘with’: This may be compared with the Proto-Indo-European stem *sem-
/*si- ‘together with’, found, for example, in Sanskrit in its reduced form sa- (< *si-) in sa-
k1t ‘once’ cited above (full-grade sám ‘with, along with, together with, together, altogether’)
and in Latin in sem-per ‘always’ (for more, cf. Pokorny 1959:902—905). This stem also
provides the basis for the Greek, Armenian, and Tocharian numeral ‘1’ (Greek εpς [< *sems],
ία; Armenian mi; Tocharian A sas, B [e).
7. Hurrian undu ‘then, when’: Compare Proto-Indo-European *H÷endh-/*H÷‚dh- ‘here, there;
thereupon, then; when’ in: Armenian and ‘there, yonder’; Greek hν α ‘here and there, hither
and thither; thereupon, then, just then; where, whither; when’, hν εν ‘thence; thereupon,
60 5. Pronouns, Numerals, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Adverbs
thereafter; whence’; Latin inde ‘thence, from there; then, thereupon; from that time forth’,
unde ‘whence, from which, from where’.

Verbal Morphology
Hurrian Verb Morphology
Hurrian verb morphology is extremely complicated. As in nominal forms, the root comes
first, but, unlike the noun, it is not followed by a stem vowel (“thematic vowel”). The root is
followed by derivational suffixes, followed by aspectual/temporal forms, followed by valency
markers (class markers), negative markers, and person and mood markers. Hurrian verbs clearly
distinguish transitive and intransitive (cf. Bush 1964:177—178). Though most verbs are either
exclusively transitive or intransitive, some can be used as both, for example: un- ‘(intr.) to
come; (tr.) to bring’; na¯¯- ‘(intr.) to sit down; (tr.) to set, to put, to place’; an- ‘(intr.) to be
pleased; (tr.) to please’.84
The endings of transitive verbs agree with the person and number of
their subject, but this is not the case with intransitive verbs. The direct object and the subject of
intransitive verbs, when they are not represented by an independent noun, are indicated by clitics
and pronouns.
One of the notable characteristics of Hurrian verb morphology is “valency”. Valency
refers to the number of noun phrases governed by the verb. The valency of a verb can be
modified either by changing the valency marker or by using a suffix that indicates intransitive.
According to Speiser (1941:85), Hurrian distinguished between three valency markers (Wilhelm
and Bush call them “class markers”; Diakonoff [1957:5], on the other hand, calls them
“indicators of transitiveness and intransitiveness”):
(1) -a-: one valency, intransitive, apparently only with verbs of motion;
(2) -i-: two valencies, transitive used in the active voice; and
(3) -u-: two valencies, transitive used in the passive voice.85
Hurrian person names can exemplify this system. The valency marker is followed by the
(obsolescent) Hurrian pronoun *-b representing ‘P3 sg. + past tense’,86
often written with <-m>,
or the more recent -š. The three valency markers function as follows:
- Unab-šenni ‘a brother came’ (intransitive)
- Tadu-Àeba (fem.) ‘Àebat is loved’ (transitive in the passive voice)
84
Examples from Wilhelm (2004a :110).
85
Wilhelm’s (2004a:111) approach does not seem to fit the pattern of person names.
86
It can be noted that -b seems to be missing, especially in feminine person names. Speiser (1941:139) nevertheless
rejects the idea that this may have a connection with grammatical gender.
62 6. Verbal Morphology
- Tadib-Tilla ‘the god Tilla loved (him/her)’ (transitive in the active voice)
- Te¯ub-šenni ‘a brother has been added’
- It¯ib-Nuzu ‘Nuzu has increased (him, her, it)’
- Àašu-keldi ‘good health has been heard’87
- Àašib-enni ‘the god heard (him/her)’
Other examples are:
- Unab-Teššub ‘Teššub came’
- Arum-Atal ‘a strong (one) has been given’
- Kelum-allai ‘a lady has been satisfied’
- Kelu-Àeba (fem.) ‘Àeba has been satisfied’
- Mušum-atal ‘a strong (one) was created'
- Pu¯u-Menni (fem.) ‘Menni exchanged (her)’
- Šarum-elli ‘a sister was desired’
- Talbuš-attili ‘the father has become greater’
- Talbun-naya ‘the harvest (?) has become greater’
- Agib-Teššub ‘Teššub raised (him/her)’
- Agib-šenni ‘The brother raised (him/her)’
- m
Arib-Ibla ‘Ebla gave (him/her)’
- E¯li-Teššub ‘Teššub saved (him/her)’
- Àaib-šarri ‘a king took (him/her)’
- Àudib-Teššub ‘Teššub praised (him/her)’
- Ki-ik-li-pa-ta-al-li-n *ki(l)kl-i-b-atal-ni ‘The strong (one) has raised (him/her)’
- Kirib-Tilla ‘the god Tilla freed (him/her)’
- Paššib-Tilla ‘Tilla sent (him/her)’
- m
Paib-Ibla ‘Ebla built (it)’
- Zilib-Tilla ‘Tilla has witnessed (him/her)’
This system of valency markers is coherent with Hurrian being an Accusative language.
The flexibility in the use of case markers in nouns is partly explained by the fact the verb system
already makes it clear what the syntactical structure of the sentences are. It can also be noted
that, in these person names, which are in fact clauses, the verb comes before the subject.
Another point about these person names is the difference between -b and -m. In the
person names, they probably are graphic variants, as noted by Speiser (1941:140): “The
variation is a phonologic88
one and thus the alleged independent -m is eliminated.” This
conclusion goes too far, and these two markers are different: -b is ‘P3sg. + Past’, and -m is
‘present participle’ as shown by this long sentence in KBo 32.14 VoIV:
87
This word refutes the approach of Wilhelm, as ‘good health’ cannot be the subject. Cf. Speiser (1941:127) talking
about this word: “The only solution is to regard the u-form as passive.”
88
In the way, Speiser used the word “phonological”. This actually means “phonologically irrelevant and of purely
graphic nature”.

‘9. A šullûubri (bread) the dog in the oven, 10. drawing * drawing in the oven, 11. in the
oil dipping * dipping, 12. in the oil lied down having a meal.’
There is only one subject: erbi-ni-š ‘the dog (Erg.)’ and one finite verbal form: na¯¯ab
‘he lied down’. The other verbal forms with -m ending are participles. It can also be noted that
several words in the Absolutive case are used with an unmarked Locative meaning. And this
section is also written in dactylic hexameters as the previous one.
According to Wilhelm (2004a:111) and Bush (1964:187—193), Hurrian distinguished
tense differences by means of the following suffixes:
a) Present tense: -Ø;
b) Past tense: -oš- *[-os-] in Wilhelm's recontruction of Hurrian;
c) Future: -ett- *[-et-] in Wilhelm's recontruction of Hurrian.
(According to Diakonoff—Starostin [1986:89—90], there is some indication that these suffixes
may have once been aspect markers.)
This approach does not seem to be correct on several counts. It seems that the past tense
maker is only -š- *[s] without the vowel. What Wilhelm reconstructs as a vowel *o is nothing
but the valency marker *-u-, something that amply testifies to the untenability of this vowel
system with *o and *e. The other valency marker -i- is shown in several person names, which
Wilhelm (1996:176) considers obscure formations. We propose to interpret them as follows:
- Aniš-¯urbe ‘The rhyton made (him/her) happy’
- Àaiš-Teššub ‘Teššub took (him/her)’ (cf. Àaib-Teššub)
- Paiš-Kumme ‘Kumme built (it)’
- Te¯iš-menni ‘Menni made (him/her) greater’
- Šeriš-adal <še-ri-ša-ta-al>89
‘The strong (one) pleased (him, her)’
The verb ending -iš seems to be a more recent development than the obsolescent Old
Hurrian ending -ib.
The tense marker of the future does not seem to be correct either. The marker is actually
-ed- *[-(y)i:d]. The dental -tt- exists only as the marker of the third person plural. It can be
noted that the future has grammatical affinities with the conditional, as shown by KBo 32.15 Ro
I 8'—9', which connects:
- <(...) ú-e-et-ta d Te-š-šu-ub>
- <ga-ap-pí-li-wa-aš pa-ri-is-sà-te u-bi >
‘8'. Will Teššub be hungry, 9'. we would give half a kor of barley’
89
This word is the origin of the non-existing equative case marker -š in Speiser (1941:204).
64 6. Verbal Morphology
The conditional is called cohortative in Catsanicos (1996:215). This term is actually taken from
Speiser. This mood is also called desiderative.
The personal morphemes for the 1st person singular are:
- Present: *[(una)-at(t)a] <ú-na-at-ta> ‘I come’ (intr.) ChS I/5 Nr.64 Rs. IV 3
*[(tad)-aw] <ta-a-ta-ú> ‘I love (him)’ (tr.) Mit. I 75
*[(pala)-aw] <pa-la-a-ú> ‘I know (it)’ (tr.) Mit. III 91, 93
*[(tan)-aw] <ta-a-na-ú> ‘I do (it)’ (tr.) Mit. II 92
- Past: *[(aru)-u-š-aw] <a-ru-u-ša-ú> ‘I gave (it)’ (tr.) Mit. III 11
*[(tan)-u-š-aw] <ta-a-nu-ša-a-u(...)> ‘I did (it/them)’ (tr.) Mit. I 73

When it comes to comparing Hurrian and Proto-Indo-European verb suffixes, the
following paragraph by Speiser (1941:202) is worth reading:
Hurrian divides its verbs into two sharply differentiated classes. This dichotomy is signalized by
the class-markers: -i- with transitives and -u/o- with intransitives. It is expressed also relationally by far-
reaching differences in construction. Thus the intransitives cannot take on agent-suffixes. Whereas the i-
class is capable of referring to person by means of these morphologic elements (e.g. -ya in 3 p. present), the
u/o- class is always construed impersonnally; its -a yields a participial form which requires the support of
associative pronouns or a noun in the subject-case to constitute a specific predicate. There is nothing in
common, therefore, between the “paradigm” of a finite transitive verb and of an intransitive, no matter what
the tense. Nor do the tense-markers of finite transitives correspond with those of the intransitives.
Hurrian Personal Endings and Indo-European Parallels
There are important parallels between the Hurrian personal endings given in the above
table and Indo-European (the Hurrian material is cited in the form given in Friedrich 1969a):
1. Hurrian 1st person singular -au (< *-a+w): In the historically-attested Indo-European
daughter languages, the 1st persons singular, dual, and plural are characterized by two sets of
endings. First, there are the *m-endings. These form the 1st persons singular and plural
primary and secondary endings found in all of the daughter languages. Next, there are the
*w/u-endings. These are found in the 1st person dual in the non-Anatolian daughter
languages (there is no dual in Hittite and the other Anatolian daughter languages), in several
perfect forms in Sanskrit, Latin, etc., in the Luwian 1st person singular indicative ending -wi,
in the Hittite 1st person plural endings -wen(i)/-wani, and, at least according to Benveniste,
the Hittite 1st singular secondary ending -u-n. It is the Proto-Indo-European *w/u-endings
that are to be compared with Hurrian.
90
Catsanicos (1996:224) develops this idea that wariša is intransitive and that -nna refers to Teššub. There is a
morphological problem with this approach. The Hittite is <d
IM-aš ma-a¯-¯a-an i-ya-at-ta-at na-aš-kán>.
6. Verbal Morphology 67
2. The Hurrian 2nd person singular/plural endings are derived from the 2nd person personal
pronoun stem we- ‘you’ discussed above.
3. Hurrian 3rd person singular/plural -a < *-e (Friedrich 1969a:17 gives -(Ô)a): For Pre-Indo-
European, Lehmann (2002:170—171) reconstructs two sets of verb endings that distinguish
the active conjugation from the stative conjugation:
Active Stative
1st person sg. *-m *-Høe (Lehmann writes *-χ-e)
2nd person sg. *-s *-tHøe (Lehmann writes *-tχe)
3rd person sg. *-t *-e
3rd person pl. *-nt *-r
Note the stative (the “perfect” of traditional Indo-European) 3rd person singular ending *-e.
It is this form that is to be compared with the Hurrian ending.
4. Note once again the Hurrian plural marker -(a)š. This, too, has a parallel in Proto-Indo-
European verb morphology; compare the Sanskrit dual and plural personal endings ending in
-s (cf. Burrow 1973:306—307): 1st person dual active primary -vas, 2nd person dual active
primary -thas, 3rd person dual active primary -tas; 1st person plural active primary -mas(i)
(Latin -mus; Greek - ες): bhárāmas (Vedic also bhárāmasi) ‘we bear’ (Latin ferimus; Greek
[Doric] φέρο ες), smás (Vedic also smási) ‘we are’ (Latin sumus), imás ‘we go’ (Greek
[Doric] n ες; Latin īmus). This -s is also found in the 2nd plural present indicative active
ending -tis (< *-te-s) in Latin: ītis ‘you go’, datis ‘you give’, vultis ‘you want’, estis ‘you
are’, portātis ‘you carry’, etc. Likewise, Gothic 1st dual present indicative bairōs (< *bher-
ō-wes [cf. Sanskrit bhárāvas]) ‘the two of us carry’, 2nd dual present indicative bairats (<
*bher-e-t(h)es [cf. Sanskrit bhárathas) ‘the two of you carry’.
Non-finite Hurrian Verb Suffixes and Indo-European Parallels
Apart from finite verbal forms, Hurrian has a certain number of non-finite formations
which have clear Indo-European parallels. They are equivalent to participles, and they have the
lexical fluidity of participles: they can be either used as nouns, adjectives, gerunds, or be the
predicate in equative-stative sentences.
1. The first one is a present participle -m-, which expresses simultaneous action and can be
further suffixed with -ae in circumstancial use:
a) alila- ‘to cry (out), to whine’, hence <a-li-la-nu-um> ‘whining’ KBo 32.15 Vo IV 9
b) kunzi- ‘to kneel’,91
hence <ku-un-zi-ma-i> ‘(while) kneeling’ KBo 32. 15 Vo IV 13
c) ¯až- ‘to hear’, hence <¯a-ši-im-ma> ‘(on) hearing (it)’ KBo 32.15 Vo IV 8
91
Note that this verb has the transitive valency probably because it means ‘to bend (the knees)’.
68 6. Verbal Morphology
This formation can be compared with the suffix -mmi- used to create verbal adjectives
from active-transitive verbs in Luwian within Indo-European: ayammi- ‘done’ (aya- ‘to
do’), *piyami- ‘given’ (piya- ‘to give’), kišammi- ‘combed’ (kiša(i)- ‘to comb’),
dupaimmi- ‘struck’ (dupa(i)- ‘to strike’). Note also the suffix *-mo-, which is used to
create participles in Balto-Slavic and Oscan-Umbrian. Finally, there are the extended
suffixes *-mno-/*-mnā- and *-meno-/*-menā-, *-meno-/*-menā-, which are used to create
middle (passive) participles from tense stems ending in the thematic vowel *-e/o-.
2. Another one is a past participle -iri-, which expresses completed transitive action:
a) pa- ‘to build’, hence pairi ‘(who has) built’ KBo 32.14 Vo 37
b) siyal- ‘to place, to put’, hence siyaliri ‘(who has) placed, put’ KBo 32.14 Vo 58
c) tab- ‘to melt (metal)’, hence tabiri ‘(who has) melted (metal)’
It can be noted that this formation is frequently nominalized: tabiri ‘(who has) melted
(metal)’ functioning as a participle is the same form as tabiri ‘smith’ functioning as a
noun. The following comparison with Latin sheds light on the origin of the -r stative
ending:
Hurrian Latin
tab-iri fab-er, -i ‘metal-worker’ (noun)
tabir-ae fabr-ē ‘with the skill of a metal-worker’
tabi-ri-lla illi fabrī-re ‘they are those who worked metal’
The Latin “perfect” illi fabrī-re is originally an equative sentence: ‘They are those who
worked metal’, hence, with a reinterpretation as a tense, ‘They wrought metal’.
3. A third formation is a past passive participle, which can be built with -iya or -adu, -adi.
There is no clear difference between these two suffixes. The comparison with Proto-
Indo-European suggests that -adu, -adi should have been used with intransitive verbs
originally, but this is no longer apparent in historical Hurrian:
a) pa- ‘to build’, hence pailiya ‘(which has been) built’
b) tab- ‘to melt (metal)’, hence tabiliya ‘melted, molten (metal)’
c) ¯inz- ‘to be constrained’, hence ¯inzadu ‘(being) oppressed, constrained’
d) na¯¯i- ‘to place’, hence na¯¯i-b-adi ‘uninhabited’ < ‘[where nothing] has been placed’
KBo 32.19 I 25 = Hitt. <dan-na-ad-du-uš>
The suffix -adu, -adi may be compared with the Proto-Indo-European suffix *-to-, which
was used to create passive participles (functionally, verbal adjectives): *$l³-tó-s ‘heard’
(cf. **$lew- ‘to hear’): Greek υ-τό-ς ‘heard of; famous, renowned, glorious’; Sanskrit
6. Verbal Morphology 69
śru-tá-­ ‘heard; known, famous, celebrated’; Latin in-clu-tu-s ‘celebrated, famous,
renowned’.
4. Another formation called “Essive” is a kind of adverbial use of a verbal stem:
a) ¯inz- ‘to be constrained’, hence ¯inza (Essive) ‘broke, without money’
5. Another formation which seems to be the intransitive equivalent of -iri- is formed with
the suffix -u and expresses completed intransitive action:
a) se¯l- ‘to enter’, hence <še-e¯-lu> ‘having entered’ in KBo 32.13 Ro I 1—2 <d
IM-ub
wa-ri-ša-an-na d
A-al-la-ni-wa še-e¯-lu : ¯a-i-kal-li> ‘Tešub goes on the road; entered
the palace (reserved) for Allani’.
b) other examples are <šu-úr-ru-ú> ‘having moved’ and <pa-a-ru> ‘being hurt’.
This formation seems to be fairly archaic in Hurrian.
Miscellaneous other formations include a causative and a nominalizing morpheme:
1. The causative is formed with -t¯- (passive causative) and -š¯- (active causative):
a) pašši- ‘to send’ hence
- pašši-t¯i ‘envoy’ < ‘who has been sent’
- pašši-š¯i ‘sender’ < ‘who has sent’
The active causative ending -š¯- can be compared with the causative ending *-se/o-
preserved only as such in Tocharian. In Tocharian, *-se/o- merged with the iterative-
intensive suffix *-s$e/o-, which then also assumed a causative meaning.
2. Another morpheme is the nominalizing -š-:
a) tadi- ‘to love’, tadiya ‘He/she loves him/her’, <ta-a-ti-ya-aš-ši> ‘who loves him/her’
This morpheme can be compared with the infinitive formation *-esen found on thematic
stems in Greek (> Attic-Ionic -ε ν), or -ere (< *-esi) in Latin. For athematic stems, Attic-
Ionic has -να , -ενα , which may represent earlier *-snai, *-esnai, respectively.
Hurrian Verb Suffixes and Indo-European Parallels
1. -ar- iterative: šiti- ‘to curse’ > šitar- ‘to curse repeatedly, several times’.
2. -ank- meaning unclear: pud- / pudank- ‘to announce, to denounce’.
3. -ill- inchoactive: šiti- ‘to curse’ > šitarilli- ‘to begin to curse repeatedly’.
4. -ul- medio-passive: e¯epši- ‘to contract (a muscle)’ > e¯epšuli- ‘to get contracted’.
70 6. Verbal Morphology
5. -umme (< *-umne ?) infinitive: tadukar-umme ‘to love’, e¯l-umme ‘to save’. Compare the
Proto-Indo-European suffix *-men-/*-mn-. In Sanskirt, a small number of Dative infinitives
are formed with this suffix (cf. Burrow 1973:131): trZ-maze ‘to protect’, dZ-maze ‘to give’,
dár-maze ‘to support’, bhár-maze ‘to maintain’, vid-máze ‘to know’. Infinitives can also
formed with this suffix in Greek: n εν, n ενα ‘to go’, ό εν, ό ενα ‘to give’, h ενα ‘to
eat’, etc. It should be noted that the -α is most likely a special Greek embellishment and is
not to be compared with Sanskrit -e (cf. Sihler 1995:609).
6. -š-, -išt- intensive: pisu- ‘to rejoice’ > pisantišt- ‘to be extremely happy’; matu- ‘to be wise’
> mataštu- ‘to be extremely wise’. This suffix was discussed above.
7. -ma negative suffix: Compare the Proto-Indo-European prohibitive/negative particle *mē ‘do
not; no, not’, found in: Sanskrit mZ ‘do not; not, that not, lest, would that not’; Greek ‘do
not; no, not’; Armenian mi ‘do not’; Tocharian A (prohibitive and negative particle) mā ‘not,
no’, (prohibitive particle) mar ‘do not’, also used as a negative prefix as the equivalent of
English ‘un-’.
8. -na-/-nu- causative: kila-/kilu- ‘to rise, to raise’ > kilina- ‘to cause to raise, to lift’. This may
be compared with the Proto-Indo-European verbal suffixes *-no- and *-nu-. The latter is
particularly productive. It is worth noting that, in Greek and Hittite, stems in *-nu- have a
causative sense: Hittite ar-nu-uz-zi (< *3-new-/*3-nu-) ‘to move along, to make go; to stir, to
raise; to transport, to deport, to remove; to bring, to transmit, to deliver, to produce; to
further, to promote’; Greek –ρνõ ‘to set on, to urge on, to incite; to make to arise, to
awaken, to call forth’. *-no- is found, for example, in: Sanskrit vé-na-ti ‘to care or long for,
to yearn for’; Avestan (pret. middle 3rd sg.) -stərə-na-tā ‘to stretch, to spread, to extend’;
Latin sternō ‘to stretch out, to spread out’.
9. -gar- dual: tad- ‘to love’ > tad-ugar- ‘to love each other’, pu¯ugari ‘to exchange’, <aš-du-
ka-a-ri> ‘alliance through marriage’.
General Characteristics of Proto-Indo-European Verb Morphology
As with nominal stems, an important distinction was made in Proto-Indo-European
between thematic and athematic verbal stems. Personal endings were added directly to the
verbal stem in the case of athematic stems, while the thematic vowel *-o/e- was inserted between
the stem and the personal endings in the case of thematic stems: cf. athematic (3rd sg. present
active) *g¦ºén-ti ‘he/she slays’ vs. thematic (3rd sg. present active) *bºér-e-ti ‘he/she bears,
carries’. Most scholars consider the thematic stems to be later formations.
Proto-Indo-European distinguished three persons. These were distinguished by special
sets of personal endings. The personal endings will be discussed below.
Again, as with the noun, there were three numbers in the verb, at least for the latest
period of the Indo-European parent language just prior to the emergence of the non-Anatolian
daughter languages: singular, dual, and plural. All three numbers were preserved in the verbal
systems of Sanskrit, Avestan, Gothic, Older Runic, Old Church Slavic, Lithuanian, and certain
Ancient Greek dialects. There was no separate dual in the Anatolian languages.
Tense marks the time at which an action takes place. The following tenses are assumed
to have existed in later Proto-Indo-European:
6. Verbal Morphology 71
1. Present: occurring in the present;
2. Imperfect: occurring at some unspecified point in the past;
3. Aorist: occurring once and completed in the past;
4. Perfect (now more commonly called “stative”): referring to a state in present time
(at a later date, the perfect developed into a resultative, and then into a simple
preterite in individual daughter languages).
There may have also been:
5. Pluperfect: referring to a state existing in the past;
6. Future: referring to an action or an event that will occur at some unspecified
point in the future.
Later Proto-Indo-European had four moods, which were used to express the speaker’s
attitude toward the action:
1. Indicative: used to express something that the speaker believes is true;
2. Subjunctive: used to express uncertainty, doubt, or vagueness on the part of the
speaker;
3. Optative: used by the speaker to express wishes or hopes;
4. Imperative: used by the speaker to express commands.
Beekes (1995:225) also adds an injunctive mood to the above. However, Szemerényi
(1996:263—264) maintains that the injunctive was not an independent modal category in Proto-
Indo-European.
There was also the category of voice, which was used to express the role that the subject
played in the action. There were two voices in Proto-Indo-European:
1. Active: the subject is performing the action but is not being acted upon;
2. Middle (also called “mediopassive”): the subject is being acted upon: either the
subject is performing the action on or for himself/herself, or the subject is the
recipient but not the agent of the action.
The agent is the entity responsible for a particular action or the entity perceived to be the
cause of an action, while the patient is the recipient, goal, or beneficiary of a particular action.
While tense marks the time at which an action takes place, aspect refers to the duration or
type of a temporal activity. Though tense and aspect are closely related, they must ultimately be
carefully distinguished. Aspect can indicate an action that is done once at a single point in time
(punctual aspect), an action that lasts for a certain length of time (durative aspect), an action that
is repeated over and over again (iterative or frequentative aspect), an action that is regularly or
habitually performed by someone or something (habitual aspect), an action or event that is about
to begin (inceptive aspect, inchoative aspect, or ingressive aspect), an action or event that is in
progress (progressive aspect), etc. A distinction can also be made between perfective aspect and
72 6. Verbal Morphology
imperfective aspect — the perfective aspect lacks a reference to a particular point of time, while
the imperfective aspect is a broad term that indicates the way in which the internal time structure
of the action is viewed. The imperfective includes more specialized aspects such as habitual,
progressive, and iterative. Though the full extent to which Proto-Indo-European employed
aspect is not entirely clear, the imperfect tense also had imperfective aspect, while the aorist
tense had perfective aspect.
Several other terms should be defined as well: a finite verbal form denotes an action, an
event, or a state and is marked for tense, number, mood, aspect, etc. A finite verbal form can
occur on its own in an independent clause. A non-finite verbal form is not marked for tense,
number, mood, aspect, etc. and can only occur on its own in a dependent clause. Non-finite
forms include participles, infinitives, verbal nouns, and verbal adjectives. A transitive verb takes
a direct object, while an intransitive verb does not. A direct object denotes the goal, beneficiary,
or recipient of the action of a transitive verb (the patient). An indirect object denotes the person
or thing that is indirectly affected by the action of the verb.
We must also note the special position occupied by *-n- in verbal derivation in Proto-Indo-
European. Unlike other derivational elements, *-n- was inserted as an infix into type II verbal
stems according to the following pattern: *CC-n-éC-, but only when the verbal stems ended in
obstruents or laryngeals. This infix was used in active forms but not in forms that indicated a state.
The nasal infix probably denoted the point from which or to which an action proceeded, so that it
characterized terminative verbs (cf. Sanskrit yu-ñ-ja-ti, Latin iu-n-g-it ‘starts to put on a yoke and
carries the process through’).
As noted by Szemerényi (1996:233), there were different sets of personal endings in
Proto-Indo-European, each of which had a specialized function. One set of personal endings was
used with the active voice and another with the middle voice and still different sets were used
with the present and past within each of these voices. Different sets were also used with the
perfect and with the imperative. Each person had its own special ending, as did each number.
Thus, the distinctions marked by the personal endings may be summarized as follows:
1. Person: three (1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person)
2. Number: three (singular, dual, plural)
3. Voice: two (active, middle)
4. Tense: two (present, past)
5. Perfect (= stative)
6. Imperative
There was also a difference between primary and secondary endings and between
thematic and athematic endings. The terms “primary” and “secondary” are misnomers — the
primary endings arose from the secondary endings through the addition of a particle *-i
indicating ‘here and now’ to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons singular and the 3rd person plural.
Intraparadigmatic Ablaut and accent variations also played a role in determining the form of the
personal endings.
We can now look more closely at each set of personal endings, beginning with the
present/aorist endings of the active voice:
6. Verbal Morphology 73

1st sg. *-m *-o-m *-m-i *-o-Hø

Notes:
1. The 1st singular and plural may have had alternative endings in */w/ besides */m/, as
indicated by the Luwian 1st singular present indicative ending -wi and the Hittite 1st
plural present indicative primary endings -weni/-wani.
2. The dual endings given in the above table are extremely controversial.
3. On the basis of the Hittite and Greek evidence, it is possible that the athematic primary
endings for the 1st person plural may have had the alternative forms *-men/*-mon in
the Indo-European parent language. It is clear that the basic ending was *-me-/*-mo-
to which the plural markers *-s or *-n could be optionally added. The individual
daughter languages chose one or the other of these variants. In the case of Indo-
Iranian, the resulting *-mes/*-mos was further extended by *-i, yielding, for example,
the Vedic 1st plural primary ending -masi, Avestan -mahi, while the same thing
happened in Hittite, but with the *-men/*-mon endings instead.
The primary endings were used in the present, while the secondary endings were used in
the aorist. In addition, the secondary endings were used in the optative and in the imperfect.
Finally, both primary and secondary endings could be used in the subjunctive. Except for the
fact that they were added after the thematic vowel in thematic stems instead of directly to the
undifferentiated verbal stem as in athematic stems, the endings were identical in thematic and
athematic stems apart from the first person singular thematic primary ending, which was *-o-Hø.
Thematic and athematic stems were differentiated, however, by the fact that there was an Ablaut
variation along with a corresponding shift in the placement of the accent between the singular
and plural in active athematic stems, while the thematic formations do not exhibit such variations
between singular and plural forms.
In Indo-Iranian and Greek, there is a prefix *H÷e-, usually termed the “augment”, which
is added to imperfect and aorist stems. The same prefix is found in Armenian, but it is only
added to the aorist. There is also a trace of the augment in Phrygian (cf. e-daes/ε- αες ‘[he/she]
put, placed’ [= Latin fēcit]). The use of the augment was a later development specific to these
branches and, accordingly, is not to be reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European. The augment
most likely developed from a Proto-Indo-European adverb *H÷e- meaning ‘at that time’.
74 6. Verbal Morphology
The next set of personal endings to be examined are the endings of the present/aorist
system of the middle voice (only the singular and plural forms are shown in the following table):
Secondary endings Primary endings
Person Athematic Thematic Athematic Thematic
1st sg. *-Høe *-o-Høe *-Høe-r *-o-Høe-r
2nd sg. *-tHøe *-e-tHøe *-tHøe-r *-e-tHøe-r
3rd sg. *-to *-o *-to-r *-o-r
1st pl. *-medhÂ *-o-medhÂ *-medhÂ *-o-medhÂ
2nd pl. *-dhwe *-e-dhwe *-dhwe *-e-dhwe
3rd pl. *-nto, *-ro *-o-nto, *-o-ro *-nto-r, *-ro-r *-o-nto-r, *-o-ro-r
Recently, there has been a shift of opinion regarding the reconstruction of the endings of
the middle (mediopassive) voice. Earlier views based the reconstruction of these endings mainly
on the forms found in Indo-Iranian and Greek, and it is these older reconstructions that are given,
for example, in Brugmann (1904:594—596) and Szemerényi (1996:239), among others.
However, the primary personal endings of the middle voice in *-r found in Anatolian, Italic,
Celtic, Tocharian, and Phrygian are now thought to represent the original patterning, while the
primary personal endings of the middle voice in *-i found in Indo-Iranian, Greek, Germanic, and
Albanian are taken to be innovations (cf. Fortson 2004:86). The personal endings found in the
middle voice were related to the perfect (= stative) personal endings, as is clear from the forms
listed in the above table when compared with the perfect personal endings, which are given
below. Clearly, the personal endings of the middle voice found in Indo-Iranian, Greek, Germanic,
and Albanian are innovations. The personal endings of the middle voice found in these branches
may be viewed as having been remodeled after the endings of the active voice (cf. Sihler 1995:472;
Fortson 2004:85). They have, however, retained traces of the older endings (cf. Burrow
1973:315). Even in the branches that have preserved the personal endings of the middle voice in
*-r, there has been some contamination by the personal endings of the active voice as well as other
innovations specific to each branch (for an excellent discussion of the development of the personal
endings of the middle voice in the various Indo-European daughter languages, cf. Sihler
1995:474—480).
Now, let us take a look at the perfect (= stative) endings (in comparison with the middle
endings, repeated here from the above table [cf. Fortson 2004:93]) (only the singular and plural
forms are given):
Endings of the Middle Voice
Secondary Endings Primary Endings
Person Perfect Athematic Thematic Athematic Thematic
1st sg. *-Høe *-Høe *-o-Høe *-Høe-r *-o-Høe-r
2nd sg. *-tHøe *-tHøe *-e-tHøe *-tHøe-r *-e-tHøe-r
3rd sg. *-e *-to *-o *-to-r *-o-r
6. Verbal Morphology 75
1st pl. *-me- *-medhÂ *-o-medhÂ *-medhÂ *-o-medhÂ
2nd pl. *-e *-dhwe *-e-dhwe *-dhwe *-e-dhwe
3rd pl. *-ēr, *-3s *-nto, *-ro *-o-nto, *-o-ro *-nto-r, *-ro-r *-o-nto-r, *-o-ro-r
The close resemblance between the two sets of personal endings is obvious, at least in the
singular. The perfect personal endings are most certainly the oldest, and the middle personal
endings are later formations derived from them.
The perfect of traditional grammar is now commonly interpreted as stative. It referred to
a state in present time and was restricted to verbs that were semantically appropriate. Later, it
developed into a resultative and, from that, into a preterite in the individual Indo-European
daughter languages. The perfect was characterized by reduplication, by a special set of personal
endings, and by a change of accent and Ablaut between the singular and plural. There was no
distinction between “primary” and “secondary” personal endings in the perfect.
The imperative also had a special set of personal endings. In athematic verbs, either the
bare stem could be used to indicate the 2nd singular imperative or the particle *-dhi could be
added to the bare stem instead (cf. Vedic śru-dhí ‘listen!’; Greek n-èé ‘go!’). In thematic verbs,
however, the thematic vowel alone was used to indicate the 2nd singular imperative without any
additional ending: Proto-Indo-European *bhér-e ‘carry!’ (cf. Sanskrit bhára; Greek öÝñå). In
the 2nd plural imperative, for both thematic and athematic stems, the personal ending *-te was
used: Proto-Indo-European 2nd plural imperative thematic *bhér-e-te ‘carry!’ (cf. Sanskrit
bhárata; Greek öÝñåôå). There were also special 3rd singular and plural imperative endings in
*-u: 3rd singular imperative personal ending *-tu, 3rd plural imperative personal ending *-ntu.
The *-u imperative forms are found in Hittite as well.
The complex verb system outlined above for Proto-Indo-European was by no means
ancient (cf. Lehmann 2002:169—182 for details). Indeed, the complex verb system had only
just started to take shape in early post-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European, and its expansion was not
fully completed by the time that the individual non-Anatolian daughter languages began to
appear. It was left to the daughter languages to fill out and reshape the system.
The Deep Foundations of Proto-Indo-European Verb Morphology
The analysis of Hittite verbal morphology has had a major impact on the verbal system
traditionally reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European. Though it is now generally accepted that
the Hittite verbal system cannot be derived from the verbal system traditionally reconstructed for
the Indo-European parent language, the exact nature of the verbal system that needs to be
reconstructed to accommodate the Hittite material is still being worked out. The most recent and
most ambitious attempt to try to reconcile the Hittite material with that of the other daughter
languages is Jasanoff 2003.
The only non-finite verb form that can be securely reconstructed for earlier stages of
Proto-Indo-European is the participle in *-nt- (cf. Lehmann 2002:183). In Hittite, it conveyed
past meaning when added to non-stative verbs (cf. kunant- ‘[he] who has been killed’) but
present meaning when added to stative verbs (cf. ¯uyant- ‘running’) (examples from Luraghi
1997:38). This was most likely the original patterning. In post-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European,
76 6. Verbal Morphology
however, its function was modified. During this stage, the suffix *-nt- was used to form present
and aorist participles in the active voice, which is how it is used in all of the non-Anatolian
daughter languages.
One thing is made clear by Hittite and the other Anatolian Indo-European daughter
languages — though thematic stems were the most common type in the older non-Anatolian
dialects (Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, etc.), they were relatively late formations in the Indo-European
parent language. They arose mostly in post-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European, where they
gradually replaced the earlier, athematic stems (cf. Lehmann 2002:160). Thus, the athematic
stems represent the most ancient layer.
Moreover, in the earliest period of development, there was no difference between primary
and secondary endings. The primary endings arose later when the deictic particle *-i meaning
‘here and now’ was appended to the secondary endings. Thus, it is clear that the so-called
“primary endings” are really secondary, while the so-called “secondary endings” reflect the
earliest forms.
Finally, as also made clear by Hittite, only two tenses were distinguished in early Proto-
Indo-European: present/future and preteritie (= non-present). Additional tenses developed in
post-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European.
But, there is more. The evidence of Hittite (second singular preterite ending, mi-
conjugation, -t(a) [cf. Luraghi 1997:34; Hoffner—Melchert 2008:181]) and Tocharian (second
singular present and subjunctive endings, active voice: Tocharian A [athematic] -(ä)t, [thematic]
-Ît92
; Tocharian B [athematic] -(ä)t(o), [thematic] -Ît(o)) seems to indicate that the original form
of the second person singular ending, active voice, may have been *-t and not *-s (cf. Villar
1991:248), though *-s is ancient inasmuch as it is also found in Hittite in the second singular
present/future ending, mi-conjugation, -ši (cf. Luraghi 1997:34; Hoffner—Melchet 2008:181).
Reconstructing a *-t in the singular would make sense in view of the plural ending *-te (cf.
Sihler 1995:454 and 464—465; Fortson 2004:84—85; Szemerényi 1996:235; Brugmann
1904:591—592). Next, the original form of the third person singular ending in Proto-Indo-
European, active voice, may have been *-Ø (cf. Villar 1991:248; Watkins 1962:90—96 and
1969:49—50), though there are strong indications that *-s may have played a part here too (cf.
Watkins 1962:97—106) — note the Hittite third singular preterite ending, ¯i- conjugation, -š (cf.
Luraghi 1997:34; Hoffner—Melchert 2008:181). At a later date, *-t became the primary marker
of the third singular present, active voice, and was also added to the third plural present ending
*-(e)n, active voice, as well, producing the new ending *-(e)n-t. No doubt, it was the
introduction of *-t into the verbal paradigm as the third person marker that brought about the
need to replace the second person singular with *-s (cf. Watkins 1962:105). Also, there are
indications that there were alternative first person singular and plural endings in *-w-. Note, for
example, the Luwian first person singular primary ending -wi, not attested in the non-Anatolian
daughter languages, which consistently have -mi (as does Hittite). Furthermore, note the Hittite
first plural endings: (primary [present/future]) -weni/-wani, (secondary [preterite]) -wen/-wan
(cf. Luraghi 1997:34—35; Hoffner—Melchert 2008:181) — in Hittite, the alternative endings
(primary) -meni/-mani, (secondary) -men/-man only appear after -u- (cf. Hoffner—Melchert
2008:181, fn. 14). Traces of the -w-endings are found in the non-Anatolian daughter languages
92
The -Î- indicates that the preceding consonant is palatalized.

in the first person dual endings (active voice): (primary) *-wos, (secondary) *-w» (cf. Sihler
1995:454; Fortson 2004:84—85; Szemerényi 1996:235; Brugmann 1904:593).
Thus, the earliest recoverable Proto-Indo-European (Lehmann’s “Pre-Indo-European”)
active personal endings may have been as follows (cf. Villar 1991:249; Watkins 1962:105):
Person Singular Plural
1 *-m / *-w *-me / *-we
2 *-t *-te
3 *-Ø, *-s *-en
The relationship of these endings to the personal pronouns traditionally reconstructed for
Proto-Indo-European is obvious.
Active verbs were used with active nouns, while stative (= inactive) verbs were used with
inactive nouns (cf. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1995.I:256). However, this represents only part of the
picture. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov (1995.I:258) note that verbs used active endings in two-place
constructions in which both nouns were active. They represent the paradigmatic conjugational
model for verb forms with active arguments in a convenient chart (A = active noun; V = verb; In
= inactive noun; superscripts show structural syntactic status):
Agent Predicate Patient
1p. A — V-mi — AIn
2p. A — V-si — AIn
3p. A — V-ti — AIn
Person kills animal
They also note that there must have also been two-place constructions in which the first noun
was active and the second inactive, such as in the phrase “person moves stone”. In an active
language, this construction would be marked by a different verb structure than that with two
active nouns. In this case, the inactive (= stative) endings would be used. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov
represent this type of construction as follows:
Agent Predicate Patient
1p. A — V-Høa — In
2p. A — V-tHøa — In
3p. A — V-e — In
Person moves stone
The “perfect” stems of traditional grammar were characterized by another set of personal
endings. The first and second person plural endings were lacking. At a later date, the endings
for these persons were borrowed from the active conjugation (cf. Lehmann 2002:171; Clackson
2007:128). The “perfect” verb endings were as follows (cf. Lehmann 2002:171):
78 6. Verbal Morphology
Person Singular Plural
1 *-Høe
2 *-tHøe
3 *-e *-er
Unlike the active verbs, which were accented on the stem in the singular but on the
ending in the plural, the stative forms were originally accented on the ending throughout the
paradigm (as was the middle, which was derived from the stative). During the earliest stage of
Proto-Indo-European, the stem was in zero-grade in stative verbs, in accordance with the rule
that only one full-grade vowel could occur in any polymorphemic form. However, at a later
date, the accent was shifted to the stem in the singular in imitation of the active verbs, with the
result that the zero-grade was changed to full-grade. The endings remained in full-grade as well,
even though they were no longer accented. The fact that the stem appeared in the o-grade
instead of the e-grade indicates the secondary nature of the full-grade vowel in the singular
forms. It was also during the later stage that reduplication started to be used with stative verbs.
Cf. Fortson (2004:93—95), Burrow (1973:341—346), and Sihler (1995:564—572) for more
information on the stative (= “perfect” of traditional grammar).
As Pre-Indo-European began changing from an active-type language to an Accusative-
type language, tense was introduced — formerly, verbs were characterized by aspect rather than
tense. At first, only two tenses were distinguished: present/future and preterite (= non-present).
This is the situation reflected in Hittite (cf. Luraghi 1997:31; Hoffner—Melchert 2008:306).
Additional tenses developed during post-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European. For details on these
and other developments, cf. Lehmann (2002:167—193).
Thus, we can see that, in the earlier stages of development, Proto-Indo-European verb
morphology was rather simple. There was a binary opposition between active verbs and inactive
(= stative) verbs. Each had its own special set of endings. In general, active verbs were used
with active nouns, and inactive verbs were used with inactive nouns. With the change of Proto-
Indo-European from an active-type language to an accusative-type language, this earlier system
was restructured, and new formations were created in accordance with the new structure.

Hurrian Vocabulary
Hurrian Vocabulary
The lexical items listed in the Hurrian vocabulary are taken for the most part from
Laroche (1980), Glossaire de la langue hourrite. Most of these items are considered Hurrian by
Laroche, and they cannot be traced back either to a Semitic or to an Indo-European language of
the Anatolian or Indo-Aryan branches. The Glossaire also contains words of Semitic or
Sumerian origin, which have not been included here. Words with unknown meaning are not
listed either. Additional items from Diakonoff (1971) are signaled with DI. Words from the
Hittite-Hurrian bilingual studied in Catsanicos (1996) are signaled with CA. In some cases,
meanings are not those of Catsanicos but taken from Neu (1988).
Each entry contains the following information when possible:
- a phonetic reconstruction *[ ]; undetermined velar fricatives are noted [H],
- Laroche’s own transcriptions [EL],
- the alphabetic transcription in Ugaritic alphabet [UG],
- the meaning translated from French or German, sometimes uncertain (?).
- the Urartian cognate [UR] or the Subarean cognate,
The prosodic classes are indicated when known: [P -3] antepenultimate mobile accent, [P
x-] fixed on initial, [P -x] fixed on last, [P >] mobile in oblique cases, [P -2] penultimate accent.
The words are listed according to the following order:
*/(")a/ */b/ */ˆ/ */d/ */g/ */ / */x/ */(")i/ */k/ */l/ */m/ */n/ */p/ */r/ */š, ś/ */t/ */(")u/
*/w/ */ž, ź/ */m/
The glottal stop is not taken into account. Words with possible lateral fricatives are not
separated from simple palatal fricatives.
On the whole, most Hurrian words can be related to a “root” with a #(C)vC- shape. It can
be noted that most #(C)vC- combinations permitted by the phonological system of Hurrian are
attested. The phonological yield of the system is very high.

<w> and <p> make it possible to reconstruct *b (probably at the Proto-Hurrian stage). In the
historically attested “dialects” of Hurrian, it seems that #b- fused with either *w or *p, in
coherence with the general absence of voiced initials in Hurrian.

Teššub (also written Teššup) was the Hurrian god of sky and storm. He was derived from the Hattian Taru. His
Hittite and Luwian name was Tar¯un (with variant stem forms Tar¯unt, Tar¯uwant, Tar¯unta). He is depicted
holding a triple thunderbolt and a weapon, usually an axe (often double-headed) or mace. The sacred bull common
throughout Anatolia was his signature animal, represented by his horned crown or by his steeds Seri and Àurri, who
drew his chariot or carried him on their backs. In the Hurrian schema, he was paired with Àebat, the mother
goddess; in the Hittite, with the sun goddess of Arinna — a cultus of great antiquity which may ultimately derive
from the bull god and mother goddess worshipped at Çatalhöyük in the Neolithic era. Myths also exist of his
conflict with the sea creature (possibly a snake or serpent) Àedammu (CTH 348). His son was Sarruma. According
to Hittite myth, one of his greatest acts was the slaying of the dragon Illuyanka. The Hurrian myth of Teshub’s
origin — he was conceived when the god Kumarbi bit off and swallowed his father Anu’s genitals — is a likely
inspiration for the story of Uranus, Cronus, and Zeus, which is recounted in Hesiod’s Theogony.

Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian
Preliminary Remarks
Hurrian cannot be considered an Indo-European language — this is so obvious that it
barely needs to be stated. Traditional Indo-European languages, such as Sanskrit, Greek, Latin,
Gothic, Old Irish, Old Church Slavic, Tocharian, etc., are clearly related to each other through
many common features and shared innovations that are lacking in Hurrian.
However, that is not the end of the argument. In the preceding chapters, we presented
evidence that Hurrian and Proto-Indo-European “[bear] a stronger affinity, both in the roots of
verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could have been produced by accident; so strong that no
philologer could examine [them] without believing them to have sprung from some common
source.”109
In this chapter, we will discuss our views on what that common source may have
been like. In so doing, we will have to delve deeply into prehistory, well beyond the horizon of
what is traditionally reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European in the traditional handbooks.
Phonology
Throughout this book, we have operated with a fairly traditional reconstruction of Proto-
Indo-European phonology. That reconstruction does not deviate appreciably from what was
reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European by the Neogrammarians and does not take into account
some of the more radical reinterpretations of Proto-Indo-European phonology that have appeared
in the past quarter century such as the glottalic model of Proto-Indo-European consonantism.
In general, the phonological system reconstructed by the Neogrammarians for Proto-
Indo-European has tended to be gradually simplified by later investigations. The only major
addition to the phonological inventory since the Neogrammarians is the laryngeals (*H÷, *Hø,
*Hù, *Hú, which are sometimes also written *™, *š, *›, *œ [Kuryłowicz]). For the rest, the
voiceless aspirates (*ph, *th, *kh, *k¦h) are best seen as local developments, which arose as a
separate series only in some Indo-European branches, such as Indo-Iranian and Armenian, while
the contrast between velars (*k, *g, *gh) and palatals (*$, *ĝ, *ĝh) has increasingly been
analyzed as non-existent in early Proto-Indo-European. The latest development in the study of
Proto-Indo-European phonology is the attempts to propose typologically acceptable systems,
among which the Glottalic Theory appears to be one of the most prominent approaches.
109
This, of course, is taken from the famous Third Anniversary Discourse presented by Sir William Jones (1746—
1794) before the Asiatic Society of Bengal on 2 February 1786.
148 9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian
In Chapter 2 of this book, we began our discussion of Proto-Indo-European phonology by
mentioning the views of Lehmann (1952:99). In his most recent work, Lehmann attempts to
define what the phonological system of Pre-Indo-European may have been like, and,
consequently, he has modified the views presented in his earlier work to take into consideration
the greater time-depth involved. First, Lehmann (2002:198—202, 211—214) now accepts a
form of the Glottalic Theory. Lehmann (2002:200) reinterprets *b, *d, *g, *g¦ of traditional
Indo-European as *p’, *t’, *k’, *k’¦, respectively. Furthermore, he (2002:200) reinterprets the
traditional plain voiceless stops and voiced aspirates as voiceless and voiced respectively with
aspirated and unaspirated allophones, as originally proposed by Gamkrelidze—Ivanov in their
version of the Glottalic Theory. As in his earlier work (1952:100—102), Lehmann (2002:214—
216) posits only palatovelars and labiovelars, assuming a secondary status for the plain velars
reconstructed by the Neogrammarians. Lehmann reconstructs the following four laryngeals: *#,
*h, *χ, *¦. Lehmann (2002:201) assumes that *χ and *¦ were voiceless and voiced velar
fricatives respectively and that *¦ may have had a w-offglide. Lehmann’s revised system is as
follows (2002:201):
Vowels
ī ū
e ē ‹ o ō
a ā
Consonants
Obstruents Resonants Fricatives
Labials: p p’ bº m w
Dentals: t t’ dº n r l y s
Palatovelars: k k’ gº
Labiovelars: k¦ k’¦ g¦º
Laryngeals: # χ γ h
Before going further, let us take a look at the interpretation presented in Chapter 2 of this
book of what the Hurrian phonological system may have been like:
Labial Dental Affricate Palatal Liquids Velar Glottal
Voiced /b/ /d/ /m/ /ź/ /l/ /ll/ /g/
Voiceless /p/ /t/ /ˆ/ /ś/ /k/ /"/
Voiced /z/ /r/ /rr/ /γ/
Voiceless /s/ /x/
Nasals /m/ /n/ /nn/
Glides /w/ /y/
9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian 149
In the chapter dealing with the comparative vocabulary of Hurrian and Indo-European
(Chapter 8), we saw that the voiceless stops of Hurrian correspond to the traditional voiceless
stops of Proto-Indo-European and that the voiced stops of Hurrian correspond to both the
traditional plain voiced stops and the voiced aspirates of Proto-Indo-European, thus:
Hurrian Proto-Indo-European
p t k p t $/k
b d g b d ĝ/g
b d g bh dh ĝh/gh
There is no evidence from Hurrian that there was any distinction between palatal and
velar stops such as what is traditionally reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European. This difference
can be explained rather easily — originally, Proto-Indo-European did not distinguish phonemic
palatal stops from velar stops. The following considerations support this conclusion:
a) The palatals only appear in the satəm languages (cf. Lehmann 1952:8 and 100—102,
1993:100—101; Meillet 1964:94—95) (and in Luwian, at least for the voiceless
member [$] [cf. Melchert 1994:234 and 251—252]), while in the centum languages,
they have the same reflexes as the velars.
b) It is not necessary to set up a special series to account for cases in which velars in the
satəm languages correspond to velars in the centum languages, since these examples
can be accounted for equally well by assuming just two series (cf. Burrow 1973:76—
77; Lehmann 1993:100—101).
This subject is discussed with great lucidity by Meillet (1964:93—94), who notes that the cases
in which velars in the centum languages correspond to velars in the satəm languages occur in
certain specific environments: (A) before *a, (B) before *r, (C) after *s, and (D) at the end of
roots, especially after *u. Meillet sums up his discussion of the gutturals by noting that the
velars were simply preserved in certain positions and palatalized in others.
Thus, there is no need to reconstruct a separate series of palatals for Proto-Indo-
European, at least in the earlier stages of development. Rather, originally, there was a single
series — the velars. The velars may be assumed to have had non-phonemic palatalized
allophones in some environments and non-palatalized allophones in other environments. At a
later date, these allophones became phonemic. The Romance languages provide an excellent
model for how these changes could have occurred (for details, cf. Mendeloff 1969; Elcock
1960). Here, Hurrian represents the original state of affairs. For more information on the
reconstruction of the gutturals in Proto-Indo-European and on different approaches to the
centum/satəm problem, cf. Meillet 1964:91—95; Lehmann 1952:100—102; Beekes 1995:109—
113 and 129—129; Burrow 1973:73—77; Fortson 2004:53—54 and 168; Szemerényi 1996:59—

Moreover, there is nothing to suggest that there was any distinction in Hurrian between
plain and aspirated voiced stops such as what is found in Proto-Indo-European. Both series
150 9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian
correspond to plain voiced stops in Hurrian. Even within Indo-European, these two series have
the same reflexes in several of the daughter languages. Moreover, the reconstruction of voiced
aspirates is only needed to account for the developments in certain branches (Indo-Iranian,
Greek, Armenian, and Italic). Finally, there is nothing in the Anatolian Indo-European daughter
languages to indicate that the voiced aspirates of traditional grammar were anything other than
plain voiced stops. And yet, when the entire corpus of comparative data from the Indo-European
daughter languages is taken into consideration, it is clear that it is still necessary to posit two
separate series here at the level of the Indo-European parent language, as well as a third series,
the traditional plain voiceless stops.
One solution is to see the traditional voiced aspirates as later developments within Proto-
Indo-European and to reinterpret them as plain voiced stops. This then makes it necessary to
interpret the traditional plain voiced stops as something else in order to maintain the distinction
between the two series. Proposals include seeing the traditional plain voiced stops as glottalized
stops (ejectives) or as plain (unaspirated) voiceless stops. Under both these proposals, the
traditional plain voiceless stops are then reinterpreted as voiceless aspirated stops. Lehmann
(2002:201) opts for the first alternative — glottalized stops. Unfortunately, Hurrian adds nothing
to the solution. This leads us to the question of what must be reconstructed to account for both
the Hurrian and Indo-European developments. Clearly, the traditional plain voiced stops and
voiced aspirates represent two distinct series in Proto-Indo-European, the Hurrian correspond-
dences notwithstanding. Thus, we suggest the following interpretation: (1) the traditional
voiced aspirates (*bh, *dh, *gh) of Indo-European grammar are to be derived from earlier plain
voiced stops (*b, *d, *g), (2) the traditional plain voiced stops (*b, *d, *g) from glottalized stops
(ejectives) (*p’, *t’, *k’), and (3) the traditional voiceless stops (*p, *t, *k) from voiceless
aspirates (*pº, *tº, *kº) — the aspiration was non-phonemic and will not be written in what
follows. Accordingly, we get:
Pre-Hurrian /
Indo-European Hurrian
Traditional
Proto-Indo-European
Labial: Voiceless p p p
Glottalized p’ b b
Voiced b b bh
Dental: Voiceless t t t

Glottalized k’ g ĝ/g
Voiced g g ĝh/gh
Labiovelar: Voiceless k¦ ku k¦
Glottalized k’¦ gu g¦
Voiced g¦ gu g¦h
Note: The phoneme traditionally reconstructed as *b was extremely rare in Proto-Indo-
European, and some have questioned whether it even existed at all.
9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian 151
Proto-Indo-European had a series of syllabic resonants: *i, *‚, *C, *3. In the parallels
that we are uncovered between the vocabularies of Hurrian and Proto-Indo-European, these
sounds are consistently represented in Hurrian as follows:
Proto-Indo-European Hurrian
i um
‚ un
C ul
3 ur
Thus, it appears probable that a series of syllabic resonants is to be reconstructed here as well for
Pre-Hurrian/Indo-European: *i, *‚, *C, *3.
Next, Hurrian contained a series of dental affricates. Such sounds are missing from
Proto-Indo-European. This gap has always been problematic from a typological perspective. In
general, a contrast between velars and labiovelars, such as that posited for Proto-Indo-European,
implies a frontal contrast of some kind. There are various ways in which this frontal contrast can
be realized: (a) palatalized alveolar stops, (b) palato-alveolar affricates, or (c) dental affricates.
In the lexical parallels between Hurrian and Proto-Indo-European that we have uncovered, the
Hurrian dental affricates correspond to dental stops in Proto-Indo-European. We assume that
Hurrian preserved the original situation and that the dental affricates were eliminated in Proto-
Indo-European through deaffricatization and merger of the resulting sounds with the traditional
dental stops, thus:
*ˆ > *t (> traditional *t)
*ˆ’ > *t’ (> traditional *d)
*m > *d (> traditional *dh)
(It may be noted that similar changes have taken place in Coptic [cf. Loprieno 1995:42—44].) In
Hurrian, on the other hand, *ˆ > *ˆ, while *ˆ’ and *m merged into *m.
Finally, there are the laryngeals. In Chapter 2, we posited four laryngeals for Proto-Indo-
European, without defining their phonetic characteristics: *H÷, *Hø, *Hù, and *Hú. Laryngeals
*H÷ and *Hú are not represented in the Hurrian writing, while *Hø and *Hù appear as ¯. In
Akkadian, ¯ represents a voiceless velar fricative /x/. Hurrian had both voiceless and voiced
velar fricatives, /x/ and /γ/, both of which were written with the signs for ¯.
Thus, it appears the the phonological system that needs to be reconstructed for Pre-
Hurrian/Indo-European is as follows:
Vowels

Earlier Stages of Proto-Indo-European Morphology
The form of Proto-Indo-European reconstructed by the Neogrammarians bears a striking
resemblance to daughter languages such as Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek. Even though major
modifications of the traditional reconstruction have had to be made to accommodate the data
presented by Hittite110
and the other Indo-European Anatolian languages (Palaic, Cuneiform and
Hieroglyphic Luwian, Lycian, and Lydian), the revised reconstruction that has been emerging
(cf. Clackson 2007:90—156; Fortson 2004:81—125), though no longer as heavily reliant upon
the highly complex Sanskrit and Greek models, still posits a moderately complex inflectional
system and is still of a relatively shallow time-depth (cf. Lehmann 2002:251).
There is a growing recognition that the morphological system of Proto-Indo-European
that can be recovered from the evidence of the daughter languages is descended from a more
ancient system that was most likely characterized by an active structure. Although Proto-Indo-
European was no longer a language with an active structure, it still displays a certain number of
features and patterns that point to an earlier stage of development with active structure. These
features and patterns are discussed in great detail by Lehmann in his 2002 book Pre-Indo-
European. In active languages,111
subjects of both transitive and intransitive verbs, when they
are agents semantically, are treated identically for grammatical purposes, while non-agent
subjects and direct objects are generally treated differently. An “agent” may be defined as the
entity responsible for a particular action or the entity perceived to be the cause of an action.
Proponents of this view include Thomas V. Gamkrelidze, Vjačeslav V. Ivanov, Winfred P.
Lehmann, and Karl Horst Schmidt, among others. In his recent book entitled Pre-Indo-
European, Lehmann (2002:59—60) gives a brief description of the morphological patterns in
Indo-European reflecting an earlier active structure:
The inflections of active/animate nouns and verbs differ characteristically from those of the
stative/inanimate counterparts in active languages. Active nouns have more inflected forms than do
statives. Moreover, there are fewer inflected forms in the plural than in the singular. The first of these
characteristics is reflected in the neuter inflections of the Indo-European languages, which are reflexes of
earlier stative inflections. They lack a distinction between nominative and accusative; moreover, their
oblique forms may have endings from the masculine or feminine declensions that are reflexes of earlier
110
For a comprehensive treatment of Hittite morphology, cf. Hoffner—Melchert 2008.
111
Active languages are sometimes called “agentive” languages.
9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian 153
active inflection. The situation is also notable in the plural, where forms corresponding to singular
inflections may be absent; the plural inflection of Hittite nouns has few case distinctions, and even Sanskrit
nouns have fewer distinct forms in the plural than in the singular.
Similarly, stative verbs have fewer inflections than do the active. The perfect and the middle in
Indo-European languages are reflexes of the earlier stative conjugation. The distinctive endings of the
perfect are found only in the three singular forms, and the third plural; except for the third person, the
endings in the plural are taken from the present/aorist system, which is a reflex of the earlier active
conjugation.
As another characteristic verbal inflections express aspect, not tense, in active languages. The
reflexes in the early dialects are quite clear, as for the use of the present to indicate activity versus that of
the perfect to indicate state.
Stative verbs are often comparable in meaning to adjectives. Accordingly, adjectives as a class
were absent in Pre-Indo-European. A detailed study of Germanic adjectives has found few that have
cognates in the other dialects (Heidermanns 1993). Moreover, there is no comparable form for the
comparatives and superlatives throughout the different dialects. When these categories were introduced,
some of the more frequent adjectives maintained suppletive forms, such as Latin malus, peior, pessimus
‘bad, worse, worst’. And when adjectives became a distinct class, individual dialects like Germanic and
Slavic developed new inflections, the so-called weak, as well as maintaining a strong inflection comparable
to that of nouns. There is then considerable evidence that adjectives as a distinct class were not present in
the earlier language.
Active languages are also characteristic in distinguishing between inalienable and alienable
reference in personal pronouns. Prokosch recognized a reflex of this situation in the forms from Proto-
Indo-European *we- that are found in the first as well as the second plural of Germanic pronouns, e.g.
Gothic weis ‘we’, izwis ‘you’ (acc.), noting the same root in Latin vōs ‘you’ and second plural forms of
other dialects (1939:282).
Moreover, possessive and reflexive pronouns are often absent in active languages. The Indo-
European languages provide evidence for such a situation through their great variety in expressing those
pronouns. For example, languages as recently separated as English and German have different forms for
reflexive pronouns, e.g. English myself, German mich, English himself, herself, German sich. The German
form sich provides evidence for the late development of these expressions; it was created on the basis of
the first and second singular forms mich and dich.
Earlier in his book, Lehmann (2002:4—5) also notes:
As a fundamental characteristic of active languages, the lexicon must be regarded as primary. It
consists of three classes: nouns, verbs and particles. Nouns and verbs are either animate/active or
inanimate/stative. Sentences are constructed on the basis of agreement between the agent/subject and the
verb; they are primarily made up of either active nouns paired with active verbs or of stative nouns paired
with stative verbs. Particles may be included in sentences to indicate relationships among nouns and verbs.
In keeping with active structure, the lexical items are autonomous…
In accordance with this structure, two nouns and two verbs may be present in the lexicon for
objects and actions that may be regarded on the one hand as being active or on the other hand as
representing a state. Among such phenomena is fire, which may be flaring and accordingly viewed as
active or animate, as expressed by Sanskrit Agnís and Latin ignis, which are masculine in gender, or as
simply glowing and inactive, as expressed by Hittite pahhur, Greek pûr [π™ρ], which are neuter in gender.
Similarly, the action lying may be regarded as active, i.e. ‘to lie down’, as expressed by Greek légō [ έγω]
‘lay, lull to sleep’ (cf. Pokorny 1959:658—59) or as stative, as expressed by Greek keĩtai [ εsτα ], Sanskrit
śéte ‘is lying’ (cf. Pokorny 1959:539—40). Through their inflection and some of their uses, such lexical
items may be recognized in the texts; but by the time of the dialects the earlier distinctions may have been
lost. As Pokorny says of reflexes of *legh-, it was punctual originally but its reflexes subsequently became
durative. Other verbs as well as nouns were modified so that specific active or stative meanings of their
reflexes were no longer central in the dialects.
154 9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian
As a further characteristic, there is relatively little inflection, especially for the stative words.
Inactive or stative verbs were inflected only for the singular and third plural. This restriction is of especial
interest because it permits us to account for one of the features of the Indo-European perfect. As will be
discussed further below, the perfect has been recognized as a reflex of the Pre-Indo-European stative
conjugation. In this way, its stative meaning as well as the inclusion of characteristic forms only for the
singular and the third plural find their explanation.
In the last chapter of his 1952 book Proto-Indo-European Phonology, Lehmann attempts
to determine earlier stages of development for Proto-Indo-European. Lehmann (1952:109—114)
recognizes four separate stages:
1. Pre-Indo-European;
2. The Phonemic Stress Stage of Proto-Indo-European;
3. The Phonemic Pitch Stage of Proto-Indo-European;
4. Proto-Indo-European proper (“Late Proto-Indo-European”).
Lehmann returns to this matter in Chapter 8 of his 2002 book Pre-Indo-European. Here,
he recognizes the same four stages but updates the presentation on the basis of research that has
taken place between the publication of this book (2002) and his earlier work (1952) mentioned
above.
Pre-Indo-European and Pre-Hurrian Nominal Morphology
In a paper published in 1958, Lehmann attempted ascertain the earliest stage of Proto-
Indo-European nominal morphology and to trace its development through subsequent stages.
Lehmann returned to this topic on several other occasions over the years. This research was
incorporated into his 2002 book Pre-Indo-European. According to Lehmann (2002:185), three
markers represent the most ancient layer of nominal inflection and came to provide the basis for
the development of the central case system: (1) *-s, which was used to indicate an individual
and, when used in clauses, the agent; (2) *-m, which indicated the target when used in clauses;
and (3) *-Hú (Lehmann writes *-h), which supplied a collective meaning. Lehmann (2002:183—
186) assumes that the first new case to be added to this system was most likely the genitive
singular, followed, in due course, by the locative and dative singular. He (2002:185) further
notes that, initially, there were only two gender classes: a common gender (animate) and a
neuter gender (inanimate). Lehmann (2002:146—150) also points out that, in the earliest stage
of development, the stage he calls “Pre-Indo-European”, other grammatical relationships were
indicated by particles. Finally, as noted above, the most ancient system was most likely
characterized by an active structure.
Gamkrelidze—Ivanov also discuss earlier periods of development in their massive 1995
book Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans (original Russian version 1984). Others who have
made important contributions on this subject include Erich Neu, Karl Horst Schmidt, Francisco
Adrados, Kenneth Shields, William R. Schmalstieg, Vladimir Georgiev, Reinhard Stempel,
Francisco Villar, to name the most prominent.
9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian 155
In accordance with Lehmann’s findings, the following case forms can be reconstructed
for Pre-Indo-European:
Function (> Case) Common Gender Neuter
Subject (> Nominative) -s
Object (> Accusative) -m
Subject or Object (> Nominative/Accusative) -m / -Ø
In Chapter 4 above, we suggested that the following markers represent the most ancient
layer in Hurrian nominal inflection:
Case Animate Inanimate
Inactive (> Absolutive) -Ø
Active (> Ergative) -s
Patient (> “Accusative”) -n
We also noted that, during the most ancient period of development in Hurrian, other
relationships within a sentence were indicated by means of particles. These particles later
became integrated into the declensional system, though their original status as independent
particles is still clear by their positioning (cf. Bush 1964:119). Many of these particles have
parallels in Indo-European. We can envision an earlier period characterized by an active
structure similar to what is assumed to have existed in the earliest Pre-Indo-European by
Lehmann, Gamkrelidze—Ivanov, Karl Horst Schmidt, and others.
Thus, we arrive at the following conclusions concerning Pre-Hurrian/Indo-European
nominal morphology:
1. Pre-Hurrian/Indo-European was characterized by an active-type morphological structure.
2. The nominal case system was simple, consisting, at most, of three formatives: (a) *-s, which
indicated an agent, (b) *-m, which indicated a patient, and (c) *-Hú (at least for Pre-Indo-
European), which supplied a collective meaning.
3. Other grammatical relationships were indicted by particles.
4. There were only two gender classes: (a) animate and (b) inanimate.
Pre-(Urarto-)Hurrian and Pre-Indo-European may be assumed to have diverged before the
declensional system was filled out beyond the formatives mentioned above. Each constructed
and modified its declensional system independently. Moreover, Hurrian developed into an
ergative language, while Proto-Indo-European developed into an accusative language (though
there are traces of ergative structure in Hittite [cf. Hoffner—Melchert 2008:66—67). Therefore,
we would not expect additional case forms to be comparable, and, indeed, they are not.
However, as we saw above in Chapter 4, many of these case forms were built from common
elements.
156 9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian
Pre-Indo-European and Pre-Hurrian Verbal Morphology
Lehmann (2002:169—177) reconstructs two conjugational types for Pre-Indo-European:
(1) an active conjugation and (2) a stative conjugation, each of which had its own set of personal
endings. The stative developed into the so-called “perfect” of traditional grammar.
In Chapter 6 above, we suggested that the Pre-Indo-European personal endings for active
verbs may have been as follows:
Person Singular Plural
1 *-m / *-w *-me / *-we
2 *-t *-te
3 *-Ø, *-s *-en
Stative verbs, on the other hand, were characterized by the following set of personal
endings during the same period:
Person Singular Plural
1 *-Høe
2 *-tHøe
3 *-e *-er
Some salient morphological features of Pre-Indo-European include the following (cf.
Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1995.I:233—321):
1. Object-like relationships were indicated by the position of nouns immediately before the
verb. The word order patterning for sentences with active verbs was: Subject + Adverbial
Expression + Object + Verb; inasmuch as stative verbs generally had a stative noun as
patient, the patterning for sentences with stative verbs was: Subject (= Patient) + Adverbial
Expression + Verb.
2. Verbs and nouns were either active/animate or stative/inanimate.
3. Sentences were constructed by pairing either stative nouns with stative verbs or active nouns
with active verbs, less frequently with stative verbs.
4. Active verbs were more highly inflected than stative verbs.
5. Stative verbs had little inflection.
6. There were no tense distinctions in verbs; aspect distinctions were dominant. Two aspects
were probably distinguished: (a) imperfective aspect and (b) perfective aspect.
7. Particles played an important role.
The only non-finite verb form that can be securely reconstructed for Pre-Indo-European
was the participle in *-nt-, which conveyed active meaning when added to active verbsbut stative
meaning when added to stative verbs.
Gamkrelidze—Ivanov (1995.I:283—286), among others, note the agglutinative character
of the active personal endings in Proto-Indo-European. It is clear the they have arisen from
9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian 157
earlier deictic elements: (a) *-m-, (b) *-w-, (c) *-t-, and (d) *-s-. The relationship of the first
three elements to the personal pronoun stems is obvious: (a) *me-, stem of first person singular,
used to form the oblique cases; (b) *we-, stem of first person, singular and plural (later also
dual); and (c) *te-, stem of second person singular. The last element is related to the deictic stem
*so-, which developed into a demonstrative pronoun in the daughter languages: ‘this, that’. The
later second person personal ending *-s- may also have been related to an independent personal
pronoun stem *si- ‘you’, which no longer existed in the later stages of Proto-Indo-European,
having been completely replaced by *tu-/*te-. Finally, the third plural ending *-(e)n is related to
the anaphoric pronoun stem *ne-/*no- found, for example, in: Hittite na-aš ‘that’; Armenian na
‘that; he, she, it; him, her’.
In active verbs, the plural was distinguished from the singular by an intraparadigmatic
accent shift (cf. Beekes 1995:234; Clackson 2007:124; Fortson 2004:87; Meillet 1964:241;
Szemerényi 1996:314). In the singular, the root was accented and had full-grade, while the
endings had zero-grade. In the plural, the position of the accent was shifted to the ending, with
the result that the root had zero-grade, while the endings had full-grade. This patterning has been
most clearly preserved in Sanskrit, which is particularly archaic in this regard. The patterning
was as follows, using the verbal root *H÷es- ‘to be’ for illustration:
Singular Plural
1 *H÷és + *me > *H÷és-m *H÷es + *mé > *H÷s-mé
*H÷és + *we > *H÷és-w *H÷es + *wé > *H÷s-wé
2 *H÷és + *te > *H÷és-t *H÷es + *té > *H÷s-té
3 *H÷és + *(H÷)e > *H÷es-Ø *H÷es + *(H÷)é > *H÷s-é
Note: There may have been alternative endings for the first person.
An important assumption here is that the original ending of the third person was *-(H÷)e
— the same ending found in the stative verbs. This assumption is based upon the observation
that the form of the third plural is anomalous. Had *ne- been added directly to the root, the
expected form would have been as follows: *H÷es- + *né > *H÷s-né, just like in the first and
second persons plural. However, the actual form was *H÷s-én (> *H÷s-én-t-i, after *-t- and *-i
were added [cf. Sanskrit sánti ‘they are’]). This indicates that *ne- was not added directly to the
root but, rather, to *H÷s-é, thus: *H÷s-é + *ne > *H÷s-é-n. Here, the accent was kept on the
ending *-é-, and, consequently, the element *ne had zero-grade. By the way, the same patterning
may be observed in the third plural of stative verbs, where *-ér is to be derived from *-é + *re.
The personal endings of stative verbs are to be analyzed in the same way. The first
person singular ending *-Høe is to be seen as an earlier deictic element. The same element was
added to the second person singular ending *-te: *-te + *-Høe > *-tHøe. The third person
singular ending *-e was probably originally the deictic element *-(H÷)e. Finally, the third person
plural ending is probably to be derived from an earlier deictic element *re.
Unlike the active verbs, there was no intraparadigmatic accent shift in the stative verbs.
Here, the accent remained on the ending throughout the paradigm:
158 9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian
Person Singular Plural
1 *-Høé
2 *-tHøé
3 *-é *-é-r
Pre-Indo-European subsequently went through several stages of development during
which the verbal paradigm was reshaped and greatly expanded, especially as it was changing
from an active-type language to an accusative-type language. These changes continued into
Proto-Indo-European proper. These developments are outlined in Chapter 6 of this book.
As noted in Chapter 6 above, the different personal endings for Hurrian verbs are as
follows:
Intr. Present Tr. Present tr. + anaphoric Past
P1 sg. -tta -aw -aw-(u)nna -š-aw
P2 sg. -mma -b
P3 sg. -a -a -a-nna -š-a / (arch.) -b
P1 pl. -tilla -awź(a)
P2 pl. -abba -aššu / -uššu
P3 pl. -lla -tu -ta
The comparison of these elements with Proto-Indo-European has already been done in
Chapter 6. However, a few additional observations may be offered. It is curious that the Hurrian
first and second person singular intransitive personal endings have the same forms as the Proto-
Indo-European first and second person active personal endings, except that they are reversed. In
form, the Hurrian first person singular intransitive ending -tta resembles the Proto-Indo-
European second person singular active personal ending *-t (plural *-te), while the Hurrian
second person singular intransitive ending -mma resembles the Proto-Indo-European first person
singular active personal ending *-m (plural *-me). However, things are not as straightforward as
they appear here. Careful investigation is required.
First, it appears that an earlier deictic element *-me was used as the second person
singular ending (> -mma) in Hurrian, while an earlier deictic element *-te was used as the first
person singular ending (> *-tta). In Proto-Indo-European, on the other hand, the same deictic
element *-me was used as the first person ending (> sg. *-m, pl. *-me), while *-te was used as
the second person ending (> sg. *-t, pl. *-te).
However, the Proto-Indo-European developments may be due to a rather late innovation,
at least for the first person. As we saw above, there was a competing first person form in Pre-
Indo-European: (sg.) *-w, (pl.) *-we. Though the non-Anatolian daughter languages are nearly
unanimous in requiring a reconstruction of (sg.) *-m(i), (pl.) *-me(-n/s)- for their common first
person personal endings, all have forms pointing to *-w/u- as well, such as the first person dual
endings. The Anatolian languages, on the other hand, provide rather strong evidence for earlier
*-w/u- in the singular and plural (they lack dual formations), though Hittite also has the first
person singular ending *-mi in the mi-conjugation in agreement with the non-Anatolian daughter
languages. Thus, the following scenario may be posited: The distribution of the personal
9. Before Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian 159
endings was changing at the time that the Anatolian branch split off from the rest of the Indo-
European speech community. In Pre-Indo-European, the *-w- first person personal endings
prevailed: (sg.) *-w, (pl.) *-we. Just prior to the split of the Anatolian languages, the new first
person personal endings (sg.) *-m, (pl.) *-me began to replace the *-w- endings. Though not yet
complete in the Anatolian branch, this replacement was carried through to completion in the
Proto-Indo-European ancestor of the non-Anatolian languages for the first person singular and
plural, while the *-w/u- endings were relegated to the dual.
Thus, we can see that, in both Proto-Indo-European and Hurrian, the personal endings
arose from earlier deictic elements (these are discussed in Chapters 4 and 6 above). The plural
was constructed differently in Hurrian than in Proto-Indo-European.
The origin of the transitive personal endings in Hurrian may be depicted as follows:
Later (attested) Earlier
P1 sg. -aw *-a-w
P2 sg. -b *-w
P3 sg. -a *-a
P1 pl. -awź(a) *-a-w + plural
P2 pl. -aššu / -uššu *-u + plural
P3 pl. -tu -ta *-tu *ta
Here, the plural is clearly built upon the singular through the addition of plural markers after the
personal endings, at least for the first and second persons. It may be noted that the same process
occurred independently and at a later date in Proto-Indo-European, where, for example, the first
person plural ending was extended by the plural markers *-s or *-n in the various daughter
languages: *-me + *-s/*-n > *-mes/*-men, which could, in turn, be further extended by the
particle *-i to form the so-called “primary endings” (cf. Sanskrit -masi; Hittite -mani/-meni [only
after -u-; elsewhere, -wani/-weni]; etc.). Finally, note here the Hurrian first singular transitive
ending -aw, which was derived from the same *-w- element reconstructed above for the first
person endings in Pre-Indo-European.
Concluding Remarks
Our discussion now comes to an end. In the course of this book, we have attempted to
show, through a careful analysis of the relevant phonological, morphological, and lexical data,
that Urarto-Hurrian and Indo-European are, in fact, genetically related at a very deep level, as we
indicated at the beginning of this chapter by quoting from the famous Third Anniversary
Discourse (1786) of Sir William Jones. We propose that both are descended from a common
ancestor, which may be called “Proto-Asianic”, to revive an old, but not forgotten, term.
