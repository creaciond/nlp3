of development, the relational markers listed below were free relational morphemes
(postpositional particles). In later Proto-Nostratic, however, at least two of them were
well on their way to becoming bound relational morphemes (case suffixes).
As already noted, only the following two bound relational markers (case
suffixes) can be confidently reconstructed for the latest period of Proto-Nostratic: (A)
direct object *-ma, *-na and (B) genitive *-nu. Other case relationships were expressed
by postpositions (see below for a list), some of which developed into bound case
morphemes in the individual daughter languages. This is confirmed by Dravidian,
where only the accusative (*-ay, *-Vn), dative (*-kk-/*-k-), and genitive (*-a, *-in) can
be confidently reconstructed for the Dravidian parent language. Other case forms
developed within the Dravidian daughter languages. Likewise, only the following two
grammatical cases can be reconstructed for Proto-Uralic: (A) accusative *-m, which
probably was used to mark the definite direct object of finite verbs, and (B) a
subordinate suffix *-n, which functioned as a genitive/nominalizer with nouns and as an
adverb formant with verbs. There were also at least three local cases in Proto-Uralic:
(A) locative *-nA, (B) separative *-tA ~ *-tI, and (C) and perhaps the latives *-k (and/or
*-ŋ) and *-t¨ (traditional *-ć) (and/or *-n¨ [traditional *-ń]). Denis Sinor (1988:714—
725) has devoted an important study to the question of common case markers between
Uralic and Altaic. He, too, posits a Proto-Uralic accusative in *-m and a genitive in *-n.
For the former, he notes that nothing comparable can be posited for Proto-Turkic or
Proto-Mongolian, but he does reconstruct a Proto-Tungus accusative *-m, which is in
agreement with what is found in Uralic. The clearest parallels for the latter are to be
found in the Proto-Mongolian genitive *-n and in the Proto-Turkic genitive *-n. The
genitive and accusative have converged in some Mongolian languages. This seems to
indicate that Proto-Mongolian may have preserved the *-n variant accusative form as
opposed to the *-m variant found in Uralic and Tungus. Sinor (1988:715—725) also
discusses the Uralic and Altaic parallels between various local cases. Finally, it is
worth mentioning here that, within Afroasiatic, Zaborski (1990:628) tentatively
reconstructs the following case morphemes for Proto-Omotic: (A) nominative: *-i: (B)
genitive-instrumental-directional: *-kV; (C) dative: *-s; (D) dative-comitative: *-rV;
(E) accusative: *-a and *-nV; (F) instrumental-locative-directional-dative: *-nV; and
(G) ablative: *-pV. Zaborski (1990:618) notes that some of these case forms may go
back to earlier postpositions. Parallels with Cushitic show that at least some of these
case forms go back to Proto-Afroasiatic. Diakonoff (1988:61) notes that the following
cases can be established for Proto-Afroasiatic with reasonable certainty: (A) *-Vš, *-
šV: locative-terminative; (B) *-dV, *-Vd: comitative, dative; (C) *-kV: ablative and
comparative; (D) *-Vm: locative-adverbialis; (E) *-l: directive; and (F) *-p (also *-f):
ablative (in Omotic); conjunction, demonstrative pronoun in other languages. The
ultimate Nostratic origin of several of the case forms posited by Zaborski for Proto-
Omotic and by Diakonoff for Proto-Afroasiatic is completely transparent.
In Proto-Nostratic, adjectives did not exist as a separate grammatical category.
They were differentiated from nouns mainly by syntactical means — “adjectives”
preceded the nouns they modified. Moreover, they did not agree with the head noun in
number or gender.

10. Verbal Morphology
In Proto-Nostratic, verbs fell into two types of construction: (A) active and (B)
stative. In active constructions, which usually involved transitive verbs, the
grammatical subject of the verb represented the agent performing the action, and the
direct object represented the patient, or recipient, of the action. Stative constructions,
on the other hand, expressed a state of affairs, rather than an event. Verbs expressed
aspectual contrasts rather than temporal contrasts. Tense relates the time of the
situation referred to to some other time, usually to the moment of speaking, while aspect
marks the duration or type of temporal activity denoted by the verb. Proto-Nostratic
had two aspects: (A) perfective (past) and (B) imperfective (non-past). Proto-Nostratic
also had, at the very least, the following moods: (A) indicative; (B) imperative; (C)
conditional; (D) hortatory-precative; (E) inchoative; and (F) prohibitive. There was also
a causative construction.
The overall structure of verbs was as follows:
37
Root + formative vowel (+ derivational suffix)
(+ mood marker) (+ person marker) (+ number marker)
A stem could consist of the unextended root or the root extended by a single
derivational suffix (preceded, as indicated above, by a formative vowel). The position
of the number marker seems to have been flexible — it could also be placed before the
person marker. Gender was not marked. There were no prefixes in Proto-Nostratic.
We may note here that Krishnamurti (2003:279 and 312) posits the following structure
for verbs in Proto-Dravidian:
Stem + tense-mood + (gender-)number-person marker
Stative verbs were indifferent to number and, therefore, had no plural forms.
They also had a special set of person markers different from those of active verbs. The
following table lists the active and stative person markers reconstructed for Proto-
Nostratic by Bomhard (2008.1:407; 2014a.1:436):
Active person markers Stative person markers
Person Singular Plural
1p. *mi *ma (inclusive) (+ plural marker) *kºa
*na *na (exclusive) (+ plural marker) *Ha
2p. *tºi *tºi (+ plural marker) *tºi
*si
*ni
3p. *ša- (~ *š‹-) *ša- (~ *š‹-) (+ plural marker) *Ø
*na-, *ni- *na-, *ni- (+ plural marker)
Morphologically, verbs could be either finite or non-finite. Finite forms could
be marked for aspect, mood, person, and number, but not for gender or tense. Non-
finite forms exhibited nominal inflection. In unmarked word order, the verb occupied
the end position of a clause.
10.1. Non-finite Verb Forms
The following non-finite verb forms are widespread enough in the Nostratic
daughter languages to guarantee their common origin, and, consequently, they are listed
separately here. However, at the Proto-Nostratic level, they were indistinguishable
from the nominalizing suffixes listed above.
Participle: *-n-
Participle: *-tº-
Gerundive-participle: *-l-

non-finite verb forms with those of Illič-Svityč, Dolgopolsky, Greenberg, and

Note: Greenberg (2000:182—186, no. 44) also posits a participle in *nt for Eurasiatic.
Bomhard (2008.1:356—357), however, regards this as a compound suffix: *-n- + *-tº-.

11. Illič-Svityč’s and Dolgopolsky’s Views on Proto-Nostratic Morphology
Illič-Svityč never published his views on Nostratic morphology during his
lifetime. However, his notes were gathered together and published by Vladimir Dybo
in 2004 in the proceedings of the Pécs Centennial Conference, edited by Irén Hegedűs
and Paul Sidwell. According to Illič-Svityč, Proto-Nostratic was an inflected language,
apparently of the accusative type. It had both nouns and adjectives. Nominal
declension was only available in the singular. Adjectives were declined only if they
were substantivized and used independently. Illič-Svityč reconstructs the nominal
paradigm as follows:
1. Nominative-accusative: *-Ø (zero); used for subject and unmarked object;
2. Marked object: *-mʌ; used if the object had to be topicalized in the sentence if the
possibility existed for an ambiguous interpretation of the phrase and if a definite
object was indicated;
3. Genitive (connective): *-n; possessive, etc.;
4. Instrumental: *-tʌ;
5. Local cases: Lative: *-ḳa;
Ablative: *-da;
Essive (locative): *-n.
Plurality was primarily indicated by a special marker: *-t. Illič-Svityč also
reconstructs an oblique plural marker *-j, though he notes that this is less certain.
Illič-Svityč reconstructs the following types of personal pronouns:
1. Independent pronouns — specifically for indicating the pronominal subject;
2. Forms of the subject standing by a verb, primarily in a position preceding a noun;
3. Forms of the direct object of a verb, primarily in a position preceding a noun after
the form of the subject;
4. Possessive forms next to nouns, primarily in a position after a noun.
Only the first and second person singular and plural pronouns were represented in these
four types.
Illič-Svityč reconstructs the following stems for these types:
1. Independent pronouns; these stems could be extended by a facultative emphatic
element *-na:
1st person singular: *ʌke-na;
2nd person singular: *ṭʌ-na;
1st person plural: *naHe-na;
2nd person plural: ?
2. Forms of the subject of verbs:
1st singular: *a-;
40
2nd singular: *ṭa-;
1st plural: *na-;
2nd plural: ?
3. Forms of the direct object:
1st singular: *mi-;
2nd singular: *k-;
1st plural: ?
2nd plural: ?
4. Possessive forms:
1st singular: *mi-;
2nd singular: *si-;
1st plural: *mʌn;
2nd plural: *sʌn.
Illič-Svityč also posits the following demonstrative stems (fulfilling the function
of 3rd person pronouns): *ṭa-, *šä-, *mu-; the following interrogative stems: *ḳo
‘who?’, *mi ‘what?’; and the following interrogative-relative stems: *ja, *na (?).
Illič-Svityč’s views on verb morphology were not as well developed. He
reconstructs an imperative as well as the following two opposing verb categories: (1)
The first designated the action itself (transferred to the object in the case of transitive
verbs). This was used with the subject pronoun and (in the case of transitive verbs)
with the object pronoun. Here, the nominal direct object was the marked form, and the
verb stem coincided with the infinitive. (2) The other verb form was a derived noun
ending in *-a. It indicated the state of the subject. If the verb were transitive, it
contained only the prefix of the subject, and, in this case, the object noun could not be
marked and thus always appeared in the subjective-objective case. Finally, Illič-Svityč
suggests that there existed a temporal (or aspectual) distinction between these two basic
verb categories, which was probably realized with the help of deictic particles of
pronominal origin.
Dolgopolsky’s views on Proto-Nostratic morphology differ from those of Illič-
Svityč. According to Dolgopolsky, Proto-Nostratic was a highly analytic language.
Dolgopolsky notes that Illič-Svityč, although recognizing the analytical status of many
grammatical elements in Proto-Nostratic, still believed that some of them were
agglutinated suffixes, specifically, the marker of oblique cases *-n (= Dolgopolsky’s
*nu ‘of, from’), the formative of marked accusative *-m[ʌ] (= Dolgopolsky’s *mA), the
plural marker *-NA (= Dolgopolsky’s *n
̄ [ä], used to mark collectivity and plurality),
and several others. Dolgopolsky points out that Illič-Svityč’s position is unacceptable
inasmuch as the Proto-Nostratic formants in question still preserve the following traces
of their former analytic status: (1) mobility within a sentence (a feature of separate
words rather than suffixes); (2) the fact that several particles are still analytic in some of
41
the Nostratic descendant languages; and (3) the fact that Proto-Nostratic etyma with
grammatical and derivational function are sometimes identical with “autosemantic
words”. Specifically, Dolgopolsky states (2008:26—27, §4. Grammatical Typology
[lightly edited here]):
As we can see, Proto-Nostratic was a highly analytic language. In this point, there is a
certain disagreement between Illič-Svityč and myself. Illič-Svityč, albeit recognizing the
analytical status of many grammatical elements in Nostratic, still believed that some
grammatical elements were agglutinated affixes: the marker of oblique cases *-n (= my *nu ‘of,
from’), the formative of marked accusative *-m (= my *mA), the plural marker *-NA (= my
*n
̄ [ä] of collectiveness and plurality), and several others. This interpretation is hardly
acceptable because the Nostratic etyma in question still preserve traces of their former analytic
status: (1) they preserve some mobility within the sentence (a feature of separate words rather
than affixes), (2) several Proto-Nostratic particles are still analytic in some descendant
languages, (3) Nostratic etyma with grammatical and derivational function are sometimes
identical with autosemantic words. Thus, the element *nu ‘of, from’ functions in the daughter
languages not only as a case suffix (genitive in Uralic, Turkic, Mongolian, Tungus, formative of
the stem of oblique case in the Indo-European heteroclitic nouns, part of the ablative case ending
in Turkic, Kartvelian, and in Indo-European adverbs), but also as a preverb of separation/
withdrawal in Indo-European (Baltic), as an analytic marker of separation/withdrawal (ablative)
in Baltic (functioning in post-verbal and other positions). The element *mA is still analytic in
Manchu (be, postposition of the direct object) and Japanese (Old Japanese wɔ > Jo). On the
analytical status of Jo (< Nostratic *mA), no (< N *nu), cf. Vrd.JG 278-82. The element *n
̄ [ä]
functions not only as a post-nominal and post-verbal marker of plurality (> plural suffix of nouns
in Kartvelian, Hamito-Semitic, and Altaic, ending of 3 pl. of verbs in Kartvelian, part of the
Indo-European ending *-nti ~ *-nt of 3 pl.), but also as the initial marker of plurality or
abstractness (← collectiveness) in Uralic and Egyptian pronouns: Finnish nuo (pl.) ‘those’ ↔
tuo (sg.) ‘that’, ne (pl.) ‘those’ ↔ se (sg.) ‘that’, Egyptian n& abstract ‘this’ and ‘these (things)’
↔ p& ‘this’ (m.) ↔ t& (f.). The animate plural deictic element (?) *yE ‘these, they’ functions not
only as the post-nominal marker of plurality (> plural ending in Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic,
and Cushitic), but also as a pre-nominal and pre-pronominal plural marker (in Baltic, Beja, and
Old English). The affix forming causative verbs in Hamito-Semitic may both precede the verbal
root and follow it (e.g., in deverbal nouns), which points to an original analytic status of the
corresponding Nostratic etymon. Hamito-Semitic *tw- (prefix of reflexivization in derived verbs
> Berber *tw- → t- id., Semitic prefix and infix *[-]t-, etc.) and the Anatolian Indo-European
reflexive particle *-ti (> Hieroglyphic Luwian -ti ‘sich’, Luwian -ti, Lycian -ti, reflexive particle,
Hittite z-, -za id.) are etymologically identical with Nostratic *tVwV ‘head’ (preserved with this
meaning in Kartvelian and Omotic), which proves the analytic origin of the marker of
reflexivization. In the descendant languages, most of these grammatical auxiliary words and
some pronouns turned into synthetic affixes (agglutinative in Early Uralic and Altaic,
inflectional [fusional] in Indo-European and, to a certain extent, in Hamito-Semitic and
Kartvelian).
Though Dolgopolsky seems to be implying that nominative-accusative structure
is to be reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic, grammatical typology is actually not
discussed. Some of the daughter languages do, indeed, exhibit nominative-accusative
structure (Proto-Uralic, Proto-Altaic, and later stages of Proto-Indo-European), but
others exhibit ergative-absolutive structure (Proto-Kartvelian, Proto-Eskimo-Aleut, and
Proto-Chukchi-Kamchatkan), and still others exhibit stative-active structure (Proto-
Afroasiatic and probably Proto-Elamo-Dravidian [definitely Elamite]), with each of
these different grammatical structures requiring a different type of clause alignment.
42
No details are given as to how the inherited system was transformed into the systems
found in the different daughter languages, nor is there any discussion of non-Nostratic
languages or language families to show that the morphological structure being posited
by Dolgopolsky for the Nostratic parent language has typological parallels in attested
languages.
In actual fact, the type of grammatical structure that seems to be able to account
best for the circumstances found in the Nostratic daughter languages is not nominative-
accusative but, rather, stative-active (cf. Bomhard 2008.1:387—415). As noted above,
this type of grammatical structure was found in Proto-Afroasiatic and Proto-Elamo-
Dravidian. In addition, stative-active structure has been convincingly posited for earlier
stages of Proto-Indo-European by a number of distinguished scholars (for details, cf.
Bomhard 2008.1:417—529; 2014a.1:531—545).
Though Bomhard mostly agrees with Dolgopolsky that Proto-Nostratic was
originally an analytic language, he maintains that, in its latest stage of development,
several of the particles were beginning to develop into bound relational markers.
Bomhard devotes two chapters in his 2008 and 2014a books to Proto-Nostratic
morphology. In the first chapter (Chapter 16), he presents the evidence, while, in the
following chapter (Chapter 17), he attempts a systematic reconstruction of Proto-
Nostratic morphology. He also devotes two chapters (18 and 19) to Proto-Indo-
European morphology.
12. Prohibitive/Negative Particles and Indeclinables
Bomhard (2008.1:368—373, 1:383—386, 1:415) reconstructs the following
negative/prohibitive particles and indeclinables for Proto-Nostratic:
Negative particles: *na, *ni, *nu
Prohibitive particle: *ma(ʔ)
Negative particle: *ʔal- (~ *ʔəl-)
Negative particle: *li (~ *le) (?)
Negative particle: *ʔe
Post-positional intensifying and conjoining particle: *k¦ºa- (~ *k¦º‹-)
Particle: *k¦ºay- ‘when, as, though, also’
Particle: *ħar¨- ‘or; with, and; then, therefore’
Particle: *ʔin- (~ *ʔen-), *(-)ni ‘in, into, towards, besides, moreover’
Sentence particle: *wa (~ *wə) ‘and, also, but; like, as’
Coordinating conjunction: *ʔaw-, *ʔwa- (~ *ʔwə-) ‘or’
Note: The CVC- root structure patterning of some of these forms points to their
ultimate nominal or verbal origin. For example, the negative particle *ʔal- (~
*ʔəl-) must ultimately have been a negative verb stem meaning ‘to be not so-
and-so’, as in Dravidian (cf. Bomhard 2008.1:371—372, §16.57, and 2:578—
580, no. 545; see also Greenberg 2000:214—217, §58. Negative E/ELE; Illič-
Svityč 1971—1984.I:263—264, no. 128, *#äla particle of categorical negation;
Dolgopolsky 2008:106—107, no. 22, *#äla particle of negation and categorical
43
prohibition), while *ʔin- (~ *ʔen-), *(-)ni was originally a nominal stem
meaning ‘place, location’ (cf. Dolgopolsky 2008:130—133, no. 45, *#in̄[A]
‘place’ [(in descendant languages) → ‘in’]).
13. Remarks on Nostratic Sound Correspondences
The Nostratic sound correspondences given in the tables in the Appendix at the
end of this paper are based exclusively upon the work of Bomhard (the correspondence
sets established by Illič-Svityč and Dolgopolsky are presented at the beginning of this
paper, though only for stops). As previously mentioned, Bomhard’s views differ in
several significant respects from those of the Moscow School, as represented in the
work of Illič-Svityč and Dolgopolsky. Bomhard bases his views on three fundamental
assumptions:
1. The traditional reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European consonant system is
flawed and is to be reinterpreted along the lines proposed, on the one hand, by
Thomas V. Gamkrelidze and Vjačeslav V. Ivanov and, on the other hand, by Paul J.
Hopper, as follows (the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European stop system
posited by Lehmann [1952:99] is given for comparison):
Lehmann Gamkrelidze—Ivanov
b bº p = p’ bh/b ph/p
d dº t = t’ dh/d th/t
g gº k = k’ gh/g kh/k
g¦ g¦º k¦ = k’ß gßh/gß kßh/kß
2. The frequency distribution of Proto-Nostratic stops (and affricates) in the
reconstruction proposed by Illič-Svityč and Dolgopolsky is in contradiction to
typological predictions, and is, therefore, highly suspect (see below).
3. Taking into consideration (1) the radical reinterpretation of the Proto-Indo-European
consonant system proposed by Gamkrelidze, Ivanov, and Hopper, as well as (2) the
problems in the frequency distribution of stops (and affricates) in the reconstruction
of the Proto-Nostratic phonological system proposed by Illič-Svityč and
Dolgopolsky, a different set of Nostratic sound correspondences is warranted.
Each of these assumptions must be evaluated independently. The reasons that
each of these assumptions must be evaluated independently are as follows: Even if
assumption 1 proves to be untenable, it does not invalidate assumption 2. Likewise,
even if assumption 2 proves to be untenable, it does not invalidate assumption 1.
Assumption 3, on the other hand, is dependent upon assumption 2 but not assumption 1.
That is to say, assumption 3 is not dependent upon any particular reconstruction of the
Proto-Indo-European consonant system, though, it goes without saying, if assumption 1
is valid, it reinforces the likelihood that the revised set of Nostratic sound
44
correspondences that Bomhard has proposed is correct. Inasmuch as assumption 3 is
dependent on assumption 2, however, if assumption 2 is invalid, then assumption 3 is
unnecessary. Moreover, even if assumption 2 is valid and a different set of Nostratic
sound correspondences is warranted, it does not necessarily follow that the alternative
correspondences that Bomhard has proposed are the only possible scenario, though
other scenarios are considerably less likely.
Let us now consider the basis for assumption 2: The mistake that Illič-Svityč
and Dolgopolsky made was in trying to equate the glottalized stops of Proto-Kartvelian
and Proto-Afroasiatic with the traditional plain voiceless stops of Proto-Indo-European.
Their reconstruction would make the glottalized stops the least marked members in the
Proto-Nostratic labial series and the most marked in the velar series. Such a
reconstruction is thus in contradiction to typological evidence, according to which
glottalized stops uniformly have the opposite frequency distribution (most marked in
the labial series and least marked in the velar series). The reason that Illič-Svityč’s and
Dolgopolsky’s reconstruction contradicts the typological evidence is as follows: Illič-
Svityč and Dolgopolsky posit glottalics for Proto-Nostratic on the basis of a small
number of seemingly solid examples in which glottalics in Proto-Afroasiatic and/or
Proto-Kartvelian appear to correspond to traditional plain voiceless stops in Proto-Indo-
European. On the basis of these examples, they assume that, whenever there is a
voiceless stop in the Proto-Indo-European examples they cite, a glottalic is to be
reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic, even when there are no glottalics in the corresponding
Kartvelian and Afroasiatic forms! This means that the Proto-Nostratic glottalics have
the same frequency distribution as the Proto-Indo-European plain voiceless stops.
Clearly, this cannot be correct (Alexis Manaster Ramer [1997] makes the same
observation). The main consequence of the mistaken comparison of the glottalized
stops of Proto-Kartvelian and Proto-Afroasiatic with the traditional plain voiceless stops
of Proto-Indo-European is that Illič-Svityč and Dolgopolsky are led to posit forms for
Proto-Nostratic on the basis of theoretical considerations but for which there is
absolutely no evidence in any of the Nostratic daughter languages.
The question then arises: Do these criticisms completely invalidate the cognate
sets involving glottalized stops (and affricates) proposed by Illič-Svityč and
Dolgopolsky? Well, no, not exactly — it is not quite that simple. In many cases, the
etymologies are correct, but the Proto-Nostratic reconstructions are wrong — here, a
simple rewriting of the reconstructions is all that is required. Other examples adduced
by Illič-Svityč and Dolgopolsky admit alternative explanations, while still others are
questionable from a semantic point of view and should be abandoned. Once the
questionable examples are removed, there is an extremely small number left over (no
more than a handful) that appear to support their position. However, compared to the
massive counter-evidence supplied by Bomhard (2008, volume 2), even these remaining
examples become suspect (they may be borrowings or simply false cognates). Finally,
there are even some examples where the comparison of glottalized stops in Proto-
Kartvelian and Proto-Afroasiatic with plain voiceless stops in Proto-Indo-European is
correct. This occurs in the cases where two glottalics originally appeared in a Proto-
Nostratic root: *C’VC’-. Such roots are preserved without change in Proto-Kartvelian

and Proto-Afroasiatic, while in Proto-Indo-European, they have been subject to a rule of
regressive deglottalization: *C’VC’- > *CVC’-.
We may close this section by noting that Campbell—Poser (2008:243—264)
have recently prepared a highly critical and devastating assessment of the work on
Nostratic by the Moscow School in general and by Illič-Svityč in particular. They
conclude:
To summarize the results of our investigation of IS’s Uralic and Indo-European data and his
methods, we see serious problems with the methods utilized and with the data in a large number
of the sets presented (see Campbell 1998, 1999 for details). With Uralic supposedly being the
strong suit of Nostratic, we can only assume that the forms presented from the other putative
Nostratic language families, where we have less expertise, probably exhibit a similar range of
problems. Therefore, we do not accept the Nostratic hypothesis.
14. The Proto-Indo-European Phonological System
For the latest period of development (the stage that Bomhard calls “Disinte-
grating Indo-European”), the Proto-Indo-European phonological system may be
reconstructed as follows (cf. Bomhard 2008.1:45—139; 2014a.1:45—151 for details —
Lehmann 2002:201 reconstructs an almost identical system):
Obstruents: pº tº kº k¦º
bº dº gº g¦º
(p’) t’ k’ k’¦
s
Laryngeals: # h ¸
°
Resonants: m/m
̥ n/n
̥ l/l̥ r/r
̥ w/u y/i
Vowels: e o a (i) (u) ə
ē ō ā ī ū
Notes:
1. There may also have been phonemic palatovelars (*k¨º, *g¨º, *k’¨) at this
stage.
2. In late Disintegrating Indo-European, laryngeals first merged into *h. *h
was then lost initially before vowels (except in Pre-Proto-Armenian, where
*h from earlier *¸ and *° was preserved) and medially between an
immediately preceding vowel and a following non-syllabic. This latter
change caused the compensatory lengthening of preceding short vowels,
thus:
46
eHC > ēC
oHC > ōC
aHC > āC
iHC > īC
uHC > ūC
The following table compares the symbols used by Bomhard to represent the
laryngeals with the symbols used by various other Indo-Europeanists (Kuryłowicz
1935; Couvreur 1937; Sturtevant 1942; Lehmann 1952 and 2002; Fortson 2004 and
2010; Clackson 2007; Mallory—Adams 1997):
