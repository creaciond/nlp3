Another major shortcoming is in the reconstruction of the Proto-Nostratic
vowel system, which, according to Illic-Svityc, is essentially that of modern Finnish.
As noted by Serebrennikov (1986:75), it stretches credibility beyond reasonable
bounds to assume that the Proto-Nostratic vowel system could have been preserved
unchanged in Finnish, especially considering the many millennia that must have
passed between the dissolution of the Nostratic parent language and the emergence
of Finnish. Serebrennikov rightfully calls this "a spectacular miracle in linguistic
history". No doubt, this erroneous reconstruction came about as a result of
Illic-Svityc's failure to deal with the question of subgrouping. The Uralic-Yukaghir
phylum, of which Finnish is a member, belongs to the Eurasiatic branch of Nostratic
(see section 1.5). Now, Eurasiatic is several millennia younger than Afroasiatic,
which appears to be the oldest branch of the Nostratic macrofamily. Therefore,
Afroasiatic must play a key role in the reconstruction of the Proto-Nostratic vowel
system, and the Uralic-Yukaghir vowel system must be considered as a later
development that cannot possibly represent the original state of affairs.
Finally, a few remarks need to be made about Illic-Svityc's proposed cognate
sets in general. In some of his proposed etymologies, the correspondences between
1.4. A Survey of the Nostratic Languages 19
two or three of the branches are sound from a semantic point of view, while those
adduced for the other branches are questionable. In several cases, the etymologies
should be abandoned altogether. These critical remarks notwithstanding, however,
upwards of two-thirds of the etymologies he proposes appear to be solid from both
phonological and semantic points of view, and this, in itself, is an impressive
achievement.
1.4. A Survey of the Nostratic Languages
1.4.1. Indo-European: Indo-European (in German, Indogermanisch) includes
the following branches: Anatolian (Hittite-Luwian), Italic, Celtic, Germanic,
Tocharian, Greek, Baltic, Slavic, Albanian, Armenian, and Indo-Iranian. There
are also a number of poorly-attested Indo-European daughter languages such
as Thracian, Phrygian, Venetic, Illyrian, Ligurian, and several others. Phrygian
may be the ancestor of Armenian, but this is not absolutely certain. Indo-
European languages cover all of Europe except for Basque (found in northern
Spain and the southwestern corner of France), Turkish (found in the Balkans),
and Uralic (Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and several others with extremely
small numbers of speakers), modern Iran, parts of Central Asia north of Iran,
Afghanistan, and northern and central India. European colonization has also
spread Indo-European languages to the New World, where they have mostly
supplanted Native American languages, to Australia and New Zealand, and to
large parts of Africa and Asia, where they are used as languages of
administration and/or learning. The extinct Hittite and Luwian were spoken in
what is now Turkey, while the Tocharian dialects, which are also extinct, were
spoken in what is now the Xinjiang (Sinkiang — Chinese Turkestan)
Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China.
The Indo-European language family has been subjected to thorough study
for the past two centuries, and there is broad agreement among scholars on
essentials, which is not to say that all problems have been resolved or that
there are still not controversial issues. Several languages have extremely old
records and/or literatures, such as Hittite, whose earliest records go back to
around 1800 BCE, though the majority of documents date from 1500 to 1200
BCE; Mycenaean Greek, whose earliest inscriptions date from 1300 BCE;
Sanskrit, with the oldest part of the Rig-Veda (written in an archaic dialect of
Old Indie) probably going back as far as 1200 BCE; Avestan, the liturgical
language of Zoroastrianism, whose most ancient scriptures date from about 600
BCE; Old Persian, which begins with the Achaemenid Records from about 500
to 400 BCE; and Italic, with the oldest Latin inscription dating from the sixth
1. Introduction
century BCE, and with the earliest Oscan-Umbrian records dating from about
the fifth century BCE. Records do not begin to appear for the other
Indo-European daughter languages until the middle to later half of the first
millennium CE.
Two large dialect groups are conventionally recognized: (A) the
so-called "centum" languages and (B) the so-called "satani' languages. This
dialectal division is based upon the different treatment of the gutturals in each
group. In the satom languages, sibilants (s and z), palato-alveolar fricatives
(s and ζ), and affricates correspond to velars in the centum languages, while
velars and affricates in the former group correspond to reflexes of earlier
labiovelars in the latter group. There are other correspondences as well, found
in a small number of examples, in which velars in the centum languages
correspond to velars in the satam languages. Though much attention has been
devoted in the literature to this division, its significance is greatly overrated.
(The gutturals are discussed in more detail in section 2.4 [pp. 69—72] of the
chapter on phonology.)
Morphologically, Indo-European was a highly inflected language —
except for particles, conjunctions, and certain quasi-adverbial forms, all words
were inflected. The basic structure of inflected words was as follows: root +
suffix (one or more) + inflectional ending. A notable morphophonemic
characteristic was the extensive use of a system of vocalic alternations
("Ablaut" in German) as a means to mark morphological distinctions. For
nouns and adjectives, three genders, three numbers, and as many as eight cases
have been reconstructed, though it is doubtful that all of these features were
ancient — it is indeed possible to discern several chronological layers of
development. The traditional reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European
verbal system sets up two voices, four moods, and as many as six tenses.
Syntactically, Proto-Indo-European seems to have had many of the
characteristics of an SOV language, though there must, no doubt, have been a
great deal of flexibility in basic word order patterning.

1.4.2. Kartvelian: Kartvelian (also referred to as South Caucasian) includes
the following languages: Georgian, Mingrelián, Laz, and Svan. These
languages fall into two main groupings, namely, Svan, on the one hand, and
Georgian, Laz, and Mingrelian, on the other. Laz and Mingrelian, in turn,
form the Zan subbranch. Svan preserves many archaic characteristics. Except
for Laz, which is spoken in Turkey, and the Ingilouri dialect of Georgian,
which is spoken in Azerbaijan, the Kartvelian languages are spoken in the
westernmost parts of the Caucasus Mountains.
1.4. A Survey of the Nostratic Languages 23
Georgian, which has its own distinctive alphabet, has a literary tradition
going back 1500 years, the earliest text being a translation of the Bible dating
from the 5th century CE, only fragments of which still exist. The early
literature was exclusively religious, and it was only with the so-called "Golden
Age" (12th century CE) that secular literature began to appear.
A notable feature of Kartvelian phonology is the existence of complex
consonant clusters — Georgian, for example, tolerates 740 initial clusters, which
can have upwards of six members, and 244 final clusters. Morphologically,
the Kartvelian languages are all highly inflected; Georgian, for example, has
six basic grammatical cases as well as eleven secondary cases. A notable
characteristic of noun declension is the distinction of ergative and absolutive
cases; the ergative case is used to mark the subject of transitive verbs, while
the absolutive case is used to mark direct objects and the subject of intransitive
verbs. It is the dative case, however, that is used to mark the subject of
so-called "inverted verbs". There are several other departures from canonical
ergative-type constructions, so much so in Mingrelian, for instance, that this
language no longer possesses any true ergative features. Adjectives normally
precede the nouns they modify. Postpositions are the rule. Verb morphology
is particularly complicated — for example, Deeters lists eleven distinctive
functional elements that may be arrayed around a given verb root, though they
may not all appear simultaneously; the overall scheme is as follows:
1. Preverb(s)
2. Personal prefix(es) (subjective or objective)
3. Character or version vowel
ROOT
4. Passive suffix
5. Causitive suffix(es)
6. Plural suffix (for nominative-absolutive noun)
7. Present stem formant
8. Imperfect suffix
9. Mood vowel
10. Personal ending
11. Subjective plural suffix
Syntactically, the predominant word order is SOV, though SVO is not
uncommon.

1.4.3. Afroasiatic: Afroasiatic (also called Afrasian, Hamito-Semitic,
Semito-Hamitic, Erythraic, and Lisramic) includes six branches; Semitic,
Egyptian, Berber, Cushitic, Omotic, and Chadic. Except for Semitic, all of the
Afroasiatic languages are found in northern and eastern Africa. In ancient
times, Semitic was primarily located in the Near East, but Muslim conquests
beginning in the 7th century CE have spread a single Semitic language,
namely, Arabic, across the greater part of northern Africa, where it has totally
replaced Egyptian (Coptic) as a spoken language and has greatly restricted, but
has not totally supplanted Berber, which now exists only in isolated pockets.
It is estimated that there are at least 250 languages in the family.
The following chronology may be established for the branching off of
the various branches of Afroasiatic: Chadic, which appears to contain many
innovative features, must have been the first branch to split from the rest of
the Afroasiatic speech community. The next split was between Omotic and
Cushitic on the one hand and Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic on the other.
Finally, first Egyptian and then Berber split off from Semitic. Within Semitic,
Akkadian is the most archaic language as a whole, though Arabic preserves the
original phonological structure better than any of the other Semitic languages.
Tuareg is usually viewed as the most conservative Berber language, as are Beja
(also called Bedawye) and Saho-Afar within Cushitic. Cf. Zaborski 1992:36.
The study of Afroasiatic as a whole is still not far advanced. Several
branches, such as Semitic and Egyptian, for example, have written records
going back many millennia and have been scientifically investigated rather
thoroughly, while other Afroasiatic languages are scarcely even known.
Egyptian, whose earliest inscriptions date from about 3400 BCE, and
Akkadian, whose earliest inscription dates from the reign of King Lugalzagesi
of Uruk (roughly 2352 to 2327 BCE), were the languages of great civilizations
of antiquity, while Hebrew and Arabic are the liturgical languages of Judaism
and Islam respectively. The Semitic languages exhibit great internal
consistency as a group, with fairly straightforward correspondences in
morphology, with close resemblance in their phonological systems, and with a
large common vocabulary. In contrast, the internal divisions in the other
branches, except for Egyptian, of course, which is a single language, are far
more pronounced.
Proto-Afroasiatic was most likely highly inflected. It is simply not
possible, however, given the present level of knowledge, to reconstruct the
morphological structure of the parent language in detail, though some common
1.4. A Survey of the Nostratic Languages 25
features (such as the distinction of grammatical gender, the existence of two
verbal conjugation systems, at least one of which, namely, the prefix
conjugation, probably goes back to Proto-Afroasiatic, and a common set of
pronominal stems) have been noted. Syntactically, the classical Semitic
languages, Egyptian, and the Berber languages are VSO, the majority of the
Cushitic languages are SOV, and most Chadic languages are SVO.

1.4.4. Uralic-Yukaghir: As the name implies, Uralic-Yukaghir has two
divisions, namely, Uralic and Yukaghir. Yukaghir consists of a single branch,
while Uralic is divided into Finno-Ugrian and Samoyed. There are about 30
Uralic languages. The internal subgrouping of the Uralic languages is still not
fully settled. Finno-Ugrian is thought to have become separated from
Samoyed some time between 4,000 to 2,000 BCE. Yukaghir is located in
northeastern Siberia, while Uralic languages are spread across northern Eurasia,
from Scandinavia and central Europe in the west to north-central Siberia east
of the Ural Mountains in the east.
Hungarian is the first Uralic language for which there are written
records. Though the first printed text did not appear until 1527, Hungarian
1. Introduction
words are cited as early as the 9th and 10th centuries CE in Arabic and
Byzantine documents. Finnish literature did not begin until 1548, with a
translation of the Bible. An Estonian translation of the Bible first appeared in
1632. Yukaghir has no written literature.
Morphologically, the Uralic languages are underlyingly agglutinating,
though many of the modern languages, especially Estonian, which has
innovated considerably, have deviated from the original type. Proto-Uralic
nominal inflection had at least three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), two
grammatical cases (accusative and genitive), and three local cases (dative,
locative, and ablative). Verb morphology distinguished two conjugational
types, namely, subjective and objective. A large number of suffixes existed,
each with its own distinctive morphological function. The original syntactic
structure seems to have been SOV, and this is fairly well preserved in the
modern Samoyed and Ob-Ugric languages (Ostyak [Xanty] and Vogul [Mansi])
and Cheremis (Mari). The basic word order in the other languages is SVO,
though, as a general rule, word order in all of the Uralic languages is rather
flexible. Hungarian stands apart, word order being determined here more by
topic-comment considerations than in the other Uralic languages, so that
neither SOV nor SVO can be said to be dominant. Yukaghir is also basically
agglutinating, though a certain amount of fusion has taken place in the verb.
There are few prefixes but numerous suffixes. Postpositions are the rule.
Syntactically, the basic word order is SOV.

1.4.5. Elamo-Dravidian: Dravidian has four branches: South Dravidian,
South-Central Dravidian, Central Dravidian, and North Dravidian. Though the
vast majority of Dravidian languages are concentrated in southern India, there
are also pockets of Dravidian in northern India, in Pakistan, in Nepal, in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka, and on the Maldive Islands. At least 25
Dravidian languages are spoken. There is still uncertainty over the sub-
grouping of several languages. Elamite, which is now extinct, was located
primarily ih southwestern Iran, in the vicinity of the Zagros mountains as well
as the adjacent plains of Khuzistan and to the south along the coast of the
Persian Gulf. There is good reason to believe that Elamite once occupied all
1.4. A Survey of the Nostratic Languages 27
or nearly all of the Iranian plateau. The inscriptions of the Indus Valley
(Harappan) Civilization may have been written in an early Dravidian language
(cf. Fairservis 1992:14-23; but see also Zide-Zvelebil feds.] 1976).
The earliest Elamite text is the "Treaty of Naräm-Sin", which dates
from before 2200 BCE. After that, only cuneiform texts composed in a
slightly deviant form of Akkadian are found until around 1300 BCE, when
Elamite cuneiform texts begin to appear. The literature of the Dravidian
languages, especially Tamil, is enormous. In addition to Tamil, Malayalam,
Kannada, and Telugu are fully-developed literary languages, while the
remaining Dravidian languages have extensive oral traditions. The oldest
Tamil literature probably dates from around the 2nd or 3rd centuries CE.
Morphologically, the Dravidian languages are agglutinating. The basic
root type was monosyllabic, though there is some indication that an extremely
small number of bisyllabic roots may have to be reconstructed at the
Proto-Dravidian level as well. This is, however, by no means certain, and it
is best at present to regard Proto-Dravidian roots as exclusively monosyllabic.
Inflectional categorization was achieved by means of suffixes added directly to
the lexical roots or to the lexical roots extended by means of derivational
suffixes. Prefixes were not used. Any vowel, long or short, could appear in a
root, but only a, i, or u could appear in a suffix. Two basic parts of speech
were differentiated in Proto-Dravidian: (A) nomináis, which included nouns
and adjectives, and (B) verbs. Nouns were inflected for case, person, number,
and gender. Eight cases (nominative, accusative, sociative, dative, genitive,
instrumental, locative, and ablative), two numbers (singular and plural), and
two genders (animate and inanimate) are assumed to have existed in Proto-
Dravidian. There were separate first person plural inclusive and exclusive
pronouns. Verbs were inflected for tense and person. There were two tenses
(past and non-past) and two moods (modal and indicative). Indeclinables
existed as a separate stem type distinct from nouns and verbs. Syntactically,
the basic word order was SOV. Elamite was also agglutinating. Three basic
parts of speech were differentiated: (A) verbs, (B) nomináis, and (C)
indeclinables. The basic verbal stem form was (C)VCCV ). Grammatical
categorization was achieved by means of suffixation. In the nominal stems,
case relationships were mostly indicated by the use of postpositions. Verb
morphology was extremely simple. Word order structure was SOV.

1. Introduction
1.4.6. Altaic: Altaic has three divisions: Mongolian, (Manchu-)Tungus, and
(Chuvash-)Turkic. Mongolian languages are spoken in Mongolia proper, in
northern China in the so-called "Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region", in
eastern Siberia in areas bordering on Mongolia, and (Moghol) in Afghanistan;
(Manchu-)Tungus languages are spoken in eastern Siberia and (Manchu) in
northeastern China in what was formerly known as Manchuria, but which is
now divided between the provinces of Hëilôngjiâng, Jílín, and Liáoníng and
the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and is populated mostly by ethnic
Chinese (Hàn); and (Chuvash-)Turkic languages are spoken in a large, discon-
tinuous band, stretching from Turkey in the west, across Central Asia and
western China in the middle, and on to northeastern Siberia in the east.
The oldest Turkic texts are the Orkhon inscriptions of the Kiil-Tegin
stele, written in a type of runic and dating from 735 CE. The earliest
Mongolian inscription is only five lines long and mentions the nephew of
Genghis Khan (1154-1227 CE). The longest early literary work in Mongolian
is The Secret History of the Mongols, an imperial chronicle written in
Uighur script and thought to date from around 1240 CE. Few documents in
Mongolian have survived from the period between the composition of that
chronicle and the 17th century. Beginning with the 17th century, however, a
rich Buddhist and historical literature begins to appear. There is an extensive
literature in Manchu, but most of it is of relatively recent origin and consists
mainly of translations from Chinese sources.
The phonological systems of the Altaic languages are comparatively
uncomplicated. Vowel harmony is a common phonological characteristic,
though, in the (Chuvash-)Turkic and Mongolian branches, it is based on a
front ~ back contrast, while, in the (Manchu-)Tungus branch, it is based on a
high ~ low contrast. It is difficult to reconstruct the common Altaic
morphological system in detail since there are deep differences among the
descendant languages, the resemblances being more pronounced in vocabulary
and syntax, though there are a few notable common elements, and all Altaic
languages belong to the same type. Morphologically, the Altaic languages are
typically agglutinating in structure. Though all Altaic languages make
extensive use of suffixes, only a few of them are common to all three
branches, one notable common feature here being the use of possessive
suffixes. Nouns and verbs are clearly differentiated, though not as sharply as
in Indo-European. There is a common stock of pronominal stems, and all
Altaic languages use postpositions. Syntactically, the original structure was
SOV, and this is well preserved in the modern languages, especially the Turkic
languages, which are fairly strict in this regard, while more flexibility is found
in the Mongolian and (Manchu-)Tungus languages.

1.4.7. Sumerian: Sumerian, which is now extinct, was spoken in southern
Iraq, extending from around Babylon in its northernmost limits to the tip of
the Persian Gulf in the south. From the time of the earliest texts, several
dialects can be distinguished.
The earliest Sumerian inscriptions date from around 3100 BCE, though
the oldest intelligible literary texts date from about 2600 BCE, and the
language was probably still spoken as late as the 3rd century BCE. The
Sumerian writing system was based exclusively on the cuneiform syllabary,
which exhibits several marked stages of development over the course of
Sumerian literary history.
Though the Sumerian phonological system was simple, there are still
many uncertainties about underlying phonemic distinctions. For example, the
traditional transcription shows a voiced ~ voiceless contrast in the stops, but
this may well have been a voiceless unaspirated ~ voiceless aspirated contrast
instead. There is still not, even after more than a century of intensive study,
widespread agreement among experts in the field on many fundamental
questions of Sumerian grammar. Nevertheless, the overall structure is clear.
Morphologically, Sumerian was an agglutinating language. Three word classes
were distinguished: (A) nouns, (B) verbs, and (C) adjectives. Though
grammatical gender in the strictest sense did not exist, nouns fell into two
classes, namely, animate and inanimate, which were only differentiated in 3rd
person actor verbal and possessive pronoun affixes and in the relative pronoun.
Ten cases and two numbers (singular and plural) were distinguished. The
plural was indicated either by means of the suffix -ene, which was used only
with animate nouns, or by reduplication. In later texts, the plural could also
be indicated by the form hi-a, which was used with inanimate nouns and
which was originally an independent word meaning 'mixed, various,
unspecified', or by - m e - e s , which was properly the enclitic copula with plural
suffix. Sumerian differentiated between ergative and absolutive in nouns. In
1. Introduction
pronouns, however, the patterning was that of a nominative-accusative system.
Sumerian verbs were formed by adding various prefixes and/or affixes directly
to the verbal root. Verbal constructions fell into one of two categories,
namely, finite forms or non-finite forms. Finite verbal stems distinguished
three conjugational types: (A) the intransitive conjugation, (B) the transitive
hamtu conjugation, and (C) the transitive mariÌ conjugation. Intransitive forms
were noted by means of pronominal suffixes, while transitive forms were
noted by means of either prefixes, suffixes, or both. Syntactically, the basic
word order was SOV.

1.4.8. Chukchi-Kamchatkan: The Chukchi-Kamchatkan family includes the
following languages: Chukchi, Koryak, Kerek, Alyutor, and Kamchadal (also
called Itelmen or Itelmic). Koryak, Kerek, and Alyutor are extremely close as
a group, and these, in turn, are close to Chukchi. Kamchadal, which is now
on the verge of extinction, stands apart from the others. The Chukchi-
Kamchatkan languages are found in the extreme northeast corner of Siberia in
the Chukotka and Kamchatka peninsulas. Though written languages were
developed for Chukchi, Koryak, and Kamchadal in the 1930's, only Chukchi is
still being used in publications and education.
Chukchi consonantism is fairly simple, there being only 14 distinct
consonant phonemes, while that of Koryak is more complex than Chukchi, and
that of Kamchadal is even more complex than either Chukchi or Koryak,
containing both plain and globalized stops, voiced and voiceless fricatives, and
three lateral phonemes. A notable characteristic of Chukchi phonology is a
system of vowel harmony based on a height contrast. In this system, vowels
are classified as either "dominant" (e, a, o) or "recessive" (i, e, u) — note that
the vowel e appears in both series. The presence of a dominant vowel in any
morpheme in a word conditions the change of any recessive vowels in the
word to their corresponding dominant counterparts. A similar system is
partially preserved in Koryak.
The Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages are agglutinating. In Chukchi,
however, some fusion has occurred, particularly in the verb. Chukchi nouns
distinguish singular from plural. There are relatively few cases. Typical of all
Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages is case marking of subjects and direct objects
on the basis of an ergative-absolutive system. Chukchi and Koryak also
exhibit a certain degree of incorporation, though it is not as extensively used
as in Eskimo-Aleut. Verbs clearly distinguish between transitive and
intransitive, with the ergative being used in conjunction with transitive verbs.
1.4. A Survey of the Nostratic Languages 31
Chukchi employs postpositions exclusively. Chukchi word order is rather free,
with OV being slightly more predominant than VO.

Ruhlen 1987:135-136.
1.4.9. Gilyak: Gilyak (also called Nivkh) is usually considered to be a single
language, but the two main dialects, namely, the Amur dialect, on the one
hand, and the Sakhalin (or Eastern) dialect, on the other, are not mutually
intelligible. Of the two, the Sakhalin dialect is more archaic. The Gilyaks are
found on the lower reaches of the Amur River and on Sakhalin Island.
Though a written language was developed for the Amur dialect in the 1930's,
next to nothing has appeared in it.
Gilyak tolerates highly complex consonant clusters. Furthermore, initial
consonants undergo various alternations, which are conditioned both by the
final segment of the preceding word and by syntactical considerations. In
contrast, the vowel system is fairly simple.
Gilyak morphology is typologically similar to that found in the Altaic
languages. Noun morphology is uncomplicated. Only a few cases are
distinguished, including several basic spatial cases. Singular and plural are also
distinguished. A system of numeral classifiers has been developed. In the
pronouns, there are separate forms for first person dual and plural, while the
first person plural, in turn, has a distinction between inclusive (mer) and
exclusive (ha rj). Verb morphology is also simple, though one notable feature
worth mentioning is the wide range of non-finite gerunds that can occur.
Gilyak possesses postpositions but no prepositions. Basic word order structure
is SOV.
Reference: Comrie (ed.) 1981:266-272.
1.4.10. Eskimo-Aleut: As the name implies, Eskimo-Aleut has two branches:
Eskimo and Aleut. The Aleut dialects are mutually intelligibile. However,
this is not the case with the Eskimo dialects. Two main Eskimo dialect groups
are distinguished, namely, Yupik and Inuit (also called Inupiaq). Yupik
speakers are concentrated in southwestern Alaska, beginning at Norton Sound
and extending southward along the western and southern coasts and inland.
An extremely small enclave of Yupik speakers is found in northeastern Siberia
as well. Inuit speakers are found north of Norton Sound all the way to the
northern coast of Alaska and extending eastward across all of the northernmost
parts of Canada and on into Greenland. Aleut is spoken on the Aleutian
Islands and the Commander Islands.
Though the Eskimo vowel system is relatively simple (Proto-Eskimo had
1. Introduction
only four vowels: */, *a, *u, *3 - phonemic length probably did not exist), the
consonant system is quite complex. In contrast, Aleut phonology is far less
complicated. Nouns differentiate between singular, dual, and plural. The case
system is reminiscent of that found in Chukchi-Kamchatkin, though it differs
by using suffixes to indicate the plural. The verb makes no tense distinctions
but has four moods and separate transitive and intransitive conjugations. The
absolutive case is used as the subject of intransitive verbs and as the direct
object of transitive verbs, while a different case is used as the subject of
transitive verbs. Conjunctions and other particles are absent in most Eskimo
dialects. A notable characteristic is that incorporation has been developed to
such an extent that whole phrases may be expressed in a single word.

1.4.11. Etruscan: In spite of several heroic efforts, Etruscan has never been
convincingly shown to be related to any known language or language family.
This applies as well to recent attempts by Russian scholars to establish a
connection between Etruscan and Northeast Caucasian. And yet, there are
some important clues as to the origin of Etruscan, and these need to be looked
at in a new perspective, but, first, a few introductory comments ought to be
made.
Etruscan was spoken in central Italy, with the largest concentration of
speakers being in the region now known as Tuscany. It is now generally
accepted that Etruscan was an indigenous language of Italy and not a recent
importation. The first written documents date from the 7th century BCE,
while the latest date from the first century CE, which is probably not far
beyond the time that Etruscan became extinct. Etruscan was usually written
from right to left in an alphabet based mostly on Western Greek models.
Though approximately 13,000 Etruscan inscriptions have been found, the
overwhelming majority of them are extremely brief. The phonological system
was simple: There were only four vowels, namely, a, e, i, u, and the
consonant system distinguished a relatively small number of phonemes and
lacked a voicing contrast in stops. Syntactically, Etruscan word order was SOV.
Looking closely at Etruscan, it is clear that it contains unmistakable
Nostratic elements, including the personal pronouns mi T, and mini 'me', the
demonstrative pronouns, eca, ca 'this', and ita, ta 'this', and several lexical
items such as, for example, ma& 'honey, honeyed wine' and apa 'father'.
There is also a pronoun θί, whose meaning is unknown, but which resembles
the Nostratic 2nd singular personal pronoun. That θί may, in fact, have been
the 2nd singular personal pronoun finds support in the verbal 2nd person
1.4. A Survey of the Nostratic Languages 33
imperative endings -ti, -θ, and -θί. But, there is more. The declensional
system is blatantly reminiscent of Indç-European, and verb morphology,
though poorly known, also exhibits Indo-European characteristics. There are
five noun stem types (cf. Georgiev 1981:232—233): (A) stems ending in -a,
with genitive singular in -as or -as; (B) stems ending in -/, with genitive
singular in -is, -ias, or (rarely) -aias; (C) stems ending in -ai, with genitive
singular in -ias or -aias; (D) stems ending in -u, with genitive singular in
-us\ and (E) consonant stems, with genitive singular in -as or (later) -s.
These correspond to similar stem types in Indo-European. Moreover, the
genitive singular in - s is typically Indo-European. Etruscan also had an
archaic genitive in -n {-an, -un), which corresponds to the Indo-European
genitive plural in *-om (also *-òm < *-o-om). In demonstrative stems, the
accusative ends in -n, and this also has a correspondence with the Indo-
European accusative singular ending *-om. The locative in -ti, -θ(ί) has
parallels in Hittite. There are also Indo-European elements in the vocabulary,
a few examples being: Etruscan -c 'and' (cf. Latin -que, 'and', Sanskrit
-ca 'and'), se/wip 'seven' (cf. Latin Septem 'seven', Sanskrit saptá 'seven'),
tin 'day, Jupiter' (cf. Sanskrit dina-m 'day', Old Church Slavic dbnb 'day'), and
tiu, tiv-, tiur 'moon, month' (same stem as in Sanskrit divasa-h 'heaven, day',
divyá-h 'divine, heavenly, celestial', etc.). These give no indication of being
borrowings.
These and other similarities are discussed in detail in recent articles by
Adrados (1989a:363-383) and Woudhuizen (1991:122-150). Adrados draws the
conclusion that Etruscan is an archaic Indo-European language and that it is
particularly close to the languages of the Anatolian branch. Woudhuizen
reaches a similar conclusion. The conclusions reached by Adrados and
Woudhuizen are sober and persuasive, and, therefore, I am strongly inclined to
accept their views. The following hypothesis may be proposed: Etruscan was
one of the first branches to separate from the main Indo-European speech
community. Coming from Central Europe, pre-Etruscan Indo-Europeans
migrated westward and eventually settled in Central Italy. These intruders
may be equated with the Rinaldone culture, which dates from around 2700
BCE and which contains unmistakable Indo-European cultural elements. We
may assume that they imposed their speech and culture upon non-Indo-
European people. It is this non-Indo-European substratum that has left a trace
in the Etruscan lexicon, and which has made it difficult to ascertain the
fundamentally Indo-European character of Etruscan. The similarities that
several scholars have seen between Etruscan and the Anatolian languages are
real and can be accounted for by assuming that both became separated from
the main speech community at about the same time and that, therefore, they
34 1. Introduction
represent a more archaic stage of development than that found in later stage
languages such as Greek, Italic, Indo-Iranian, Baltic, Slavic, Germanic,
Albanian, and Armenian, which remained in close geographical proximity for a
longer period of time and which, consequently, shared many common
developments as a group.

1.5. Problems of Subgrouping
I agree with Illic-Svityc that, at a minimum, the following language families
are likely to belong to Nostratic: Indo-European, Kartvelian, Afroasiatic, Uralic-
Yukaghir, Elamo-Dravidian, and Altaic (which includes Mongolian, (Manchu-)
Tungus, and (Chuvash-)Turkic, but not Japanese-Ryukyuan, Korean, and Ainu,
which, for the moment at least, should be treated separately). Mention should be
made here of the fact.that Benedict (1990) has recently presented a large body of
evidence to support his view that Japanese-Ryukyuan is genetically related to
Formosan and other Austronesian languages, which is not to deny that there are
Altaic elements in Japanese. Indeed, Japanese appears to be a mixed language,
containing both Austronesian and Altaic elements, with the Austronesian component
being the most ancient (cf. Ohno 1970:143—144). Of the three (that is, Korean,
Japanese-Ryukyuan, and Ainu), Korean has the best chance of ultimately being an
Altaic language, but much work still has to be done before this can be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt. As noted above in section 1.1, it is probable that
several other language phyla also have genetic links to the language families just
listed; these include, in particular, Chukchi-Kamchatkan, Eskimo-Aleut, and Gilyak
(also called Nivkh). Recent research by Claude Boisson shows that Sumerian also
has important links with the Nostratic macrofamily, though the connections are not
as unambiguous as one would like.
The individual Nostratic branches are not of equal time depth. Afroasiatic
stands apart as an extremely ancient, independent branch, with the Afroasiatic parent
language probably standing at least as far back as 10,000 BCE. The morphological
structure is the most divergent of the lot, and this can best be explained by assuming
an early separation of Afroasiatic from the rest of the Nostratic speech community.
Younger are Kartvelian and Elamo-Dravidian. Indo-European, Uralic-Yukaghir,
and Altaic (and Gilyak, Chukchi-Kamchatkan, and Eskimo-Aleut as well) appear to
be more closely related as a group than any one of them is to Afroasiatic,
1.5. Problems of Subgrouping 35
Kartvelian, and Elamo-Dravidian, and, consequently, Greenberg has grouped them
together in what he calls the "Eurasiatic" language family. The Eurasiatic parent
language may be dated to approximately 7,000 or 8,000 BCE. Finally, Sumerian, if
it really does belong here, is a separate branch, probably closest to Elamo-Dravidian
(cf. Sathasivam 1965). Considering the time depths involved in the various Nostratic
branches, the dating of the Nostratic parent language may be placed roughly in the
vicinity of 15,000 BCE, though I would not be surprised if it were even older by a
considerable degree. An attempt at subgrouping is shown in chart 1 (p. 36).

2. COMPARATIVE PHONOLOGY OF THE NOSTRATIC LANGUAGES
(WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INDO-EUROPEAN)
2.1. Changing Views on Proto-Indo-European Phonology
Although the comparative-historical study of the Indo-European languages did
not begin with August Schleicher, he was the first to attempt, in the first volume
(published in 1861) of his Compendium der vergleichenden Grammatik der
indogergmanischen Sprachen, to reconstruct the phonological system of the
Indo-European parent language. Earlier scholars — especially Rasmus Rask and
Jacob Grimm — had worked out the fundamental sound correspondences between
the various daughter languages, and the need to reconstruct the phonological system
of the parent language had been recognized as early as 1837 by Theodor Benfey, but
no one prior to Schleicher had actually undertaken the task. Schleicher's system is
as follows (1876:10):
unaspirated aspirated spirants nasals r
vis. vd. vd. vis. vd. vd. vd.
guttural k g gh
palatal i
lingual r
dental t d dh s η
labial Ρ b bh ν m
Schleicher's reconstruction remained the accepted standard until the late 1870's,
when a series of brilliant discoveries were made in rapid succession (cf. Delbrück
1974:55-61; Pedersen 1931:277-310; Waterman 1970:40-50). By the end of the last
38 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
century, the phonological system reconstructed by the Neogrammarians was widely
accepted as being a fairly accurate representation of what had existed in Proto-
Indo-European. To this day, the Neogrammarian system commands a great deal of
respect and has many defenders.
The Neogrammarian reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European phonological
system, which was arrived at through strict adherence to the principle that sound
laws admit no exceptions, was notable for its large inventory of stops and its
extremely small inventory of fricatives. The stop system consists of a four-way
contrast of (A) plain voiceless stops, (B) voiceless aspirated stops, (C) plain voiced
stops, and (D) voiced aspirated stops. This system is extremely close to the
phonological system of Old Indie (cf., for example, Gonda 1966:9, Mayrhofer
1972:17, or Whitney 1889:2—3). It should be pointed out that, in spite of its wide
acceptance, a small group of scholars has, from time to time, questioned the validity
of the Neogrammarian reconstruction, at least in part (for a discussion of some of
the opposing views, cf. Hopper 1977b:57—72 and Szemerényi 1972a:122—136).
The Neogrammarian reconstruction is as follows (cf. Brugmann 1904:52):
Monophthongs: a e o i U 3
à è δ ϊ ü
Diphthongs: ai ei oi 9 ì au eu ou, du
ài ëi öi äu ëu ou
Syllabic Liquids and Nasals: r l m η ñ η
r ï m ñ ñ ñ
Occlusives: Ρ ph b bh (labial)
t th d dh (dental)
k Uh g gh (palatal
q qh a Φ (velar)
q<i q<ih g* gUh (labiovelar)
s sh ζ zh Ρ Ph
Nasals: m η ñ «
Liquids: r l
Semivowels: i u
2.1. Changing Views on Proto-Indo-European Phonology 39
The Neogrammarians reconstructed five short vowels and five long vowels
plus a reduced vowel, the so-called "schwa indogermanicum" (also called "schwa
primum"), written *3, which alternated with so-called "original" long vowels. A full
set of diphthongs was posited as well. Finally, the system contained the semivowels
*i and *u, a series of nasals, and the liquids *l and *r. The nasals and liquids could
function as syllables as well as non-syllabics, depending upon their environment.
The Proto-Indo-European vowels were subject to various alternations that
were partially correlated with the positioning of the accent within a word. These
vowel alternations served to indicate different types of grammatical formations. The
most common alternation was the interchange between the vowels *e and *o in a
given syllable. There was also an alternation among lengthened-grade vowels,
normal-grade vowels, and reduced-grade and/or zero-grade vowels.
The Neogrammarians posited voiceless aspirates for Proto-Indo-European on
the basis of an extremely small, and somewhat controversial, set of correspondences
from Indo-Iranian, Armenian, and Greek. In the other daughter languages, the
voiceless aspirates and plain voiceless stops have the same treatment, except that
*kh became χ in Slavic. As early as 1891, in a paper read before the Société de
Linguistique de Paris, the Swiss scholar Ferdinand de Saussure suggested that the
voiceless aspirates might have had a secondary origin, arising from earlier clusters of
plain voiceless stop plus a following "coefficient sonantique". Current thinking on
the part of a great many linguists is that the series of voiceless aspirates
reconstructed by the Neogrammarians for the Indo-European parent language should
be removed, being secondarily derived in the individual daughter languages (cf.
Allen 1976:237-247; Bomhard 1979a:73-74 and 1984:18-20; Burrow 1973:71-73 and
393; Hiersche 1964; Kurylowicz 1935:46-54; Lehmann 1952:80-84; Polomé
1971:233-251; Sturtevant 1941:1-11 and 1942:83-86). The main opponent of this
view is Oswald Szemerényi, who has argued for the reinstatement of the voiceless
aspirates and, consequently, for a return to the four-stop system (plain voiceless ~
voiceless aspirated ~ plain voiced ~ voiced aspirated) of the Neogrammarians. The
fact, however, that the traditional voiceless aspirates were not used to mark
distinctive contrasts in Proto-Indo-European coupled with the fact that the reflexes
of the voiceless aspirates in the daughter languages can, to a large extent, be
plausibly derived from earlier clusters of plain voiceless stop plus a following
laryngeal speak against Szemerényi's position. In conclusion, it appears highly
probable that the traditional voiceless aspirates were not part of the Proto-Indo-
European phonemic inventory (cf. Bomhard 1986a:69—70).
The first half of this century has seen the seeds planted by the young de
Saussure (in 1878) blossom into the Laryngeal Theory. The overwhelming majority
of scholars currently accept some form of this theory, though there is still no general
40 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
agreement on the number of laryngeals to be reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European
or on their probable phonetic values (the laryngeals are discussed in detail in section
2.2 [pp. 47-56]; see also Jonsson 1978; Lindeman 1987; Winter [ed.] 1965).
With the reduction of the gutturals to two series, the reanalysis of the
diphthongs as clusters of vowel plus non-syllabic resonant and non-syllabic resonant
plus vowel, the removal of the traditional voiceless aspirates, and the addition of
laryngeals, we arrive at the system of Lehmann (1952:99):
Obstruents:
2. Résonants:
3. Vowels:
4. Laryngeals:
Ρ t k kw
b d g gW
bh dh gh gwh
s
m η
w r l y
e 0 a
i· e- a· o·
χ y h
u·
The removal of the traditional voiceless aspirates creates a problem from a
typological point of view. Data collected from the study of a great number of the
world's languages have failed to turn up any systems in which voiced aspirates are
added to the pair plain voiceless stop ~ plain voiced stop unless there are also
corresponding voiceless aspirated stops in the system (cf. Jakobson 1971[1957]:528;
Martinet 1970:115). This is an important point, affecting the entire structure of the
traditional reconstruction. In order to rectify this imbalance, several scholars have
sought typological parallels with systems such as those found, for example, in
Javanese. In these rare systems, there is a three-way contrast, sometimes described
as (A) non-aspirated voiceless, (B) voiced, and (C) "voiced aspirated": ITI - IDI ~
IDh/. However, this interpretation is based upon a lack of understanding of the
phonetics involved. Series (C) in such systems is, in reality, voiceless with breathy
release — something like ItRI — and not "voiced aspirated" (cf. Maddieson 1984:207).
As we have seen from the preceding discussion, Lehmann's reconstruction is
problematical from a typological point of view. However, from a structural point of
view, it presents an accurate analysis of Proto-Indo-European phonemic patterning.
As recently as 1974, such a system was posited by Warren Cowgill in his article on
2.1. Changing Views on Proto-Indo-European Phonology 41
Indo-European in the 15th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
Several scholars have proposed various solutions in an attempt to eliminate the
problems caused by the removal of the traditional voiceless aspirates. For example,
Jerzy Kurylowicz (1964b: 13) tried to show that the voiced aspirates were not
phonemically voiced. However, this interpretation seems unlikely in view of the
fact that the daughter languages are nearly unanimous in pointing to some sort of
voicing in this series in the Indo-European parent language (for correspondences and
examples, cf. Meillet 1964:86—88). The main exceptions are Tocharian and possibly
Hittite. In each case, it is known that the voicing contrast was eliminated and that
the reflexes found in these daughter languages do not represent the original state.
The Greek and Italic developments are a little more complicated: in these daughter
languages, the traditional voiced aspirates were devoiced, thus becoming voiceless
aspirates. Then, in Italic, the resulting voiceless aspirates became voiceless fricatives:
bh
dh
gh
gwh
> ph
th
kh
kwh
> φ θ χ xw
According to Eduard Prokosch (1938:39—41), on the other hand, the voiced
aspirates of traditional grammar were really the voiceless fricatives *<p, *θ, *χ, *χ\ν.
This interpretation seems unlikely for two reasons: (A) as noted above, the daughter
languages point to voicing in this series in Proto-Indo-European, and (B) the
daughter languages point to stops as the original mode of articulation and not
fricatives. This latter objection may also be raised against the theory — advocated
by Alois Walde (1897:491) and Johann Knobloch (1965:163) - that the voiced
aspirates may have been the voiced fricatives */3, *S, *γ, *yw.
Next, there is the theory put forth by Louis Hammerich (1967:839-849) that
the voiced aspirates may have beem emphatics. Hammerich does not define what
he means by the term "emphatics" but implies that they are to be equated with the
emphatics of Semitic grammar. Now, in Arabic, the emphatics have been described
as either uvularized (cf. Catford 1977b: 193) or pharyngealized (cf. Al-Ani
1970:44-58; Catford 1977b:193; Chomsky and Halle 1968:306). Such sounds are
always accompanied by backing of adjacent vowels (cf. Dolgopolsky 1977:1—13;
Hyman 1975:49; Ladefoged 1971:63—64). In Proto-Indo-European, all vowels were
found in the neighborhood of the voiced aspirates, and there is no indication that
any of these sounds had different allophones here than when contiguous with other
sounds. Had the voiced aspirates been emphatics such as those found in Arabic,
they would have caused backing of contiguous vowels, and this would be reflected
in the daughter languages in some manner. However, this is not the case. If, on the
other hand, the emphatics had been ejectives such as those found in the Modern
42 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
South Arabian languages, the Semitic languages of Ethiopia, and several Eastern
Neo-Armamaic dialects (such as, for instance, Urmian Nestorian Neo-Aramaic and
Kurdistani Jewish Neo-Aramaic), the question arises as to how these sounds could
have developed into the voiced aspirates needed to explain the developments in
Indo-Iranian, Greek, Italic, and Armenian.
Oswald Szemerényi (1967:65—99) was one of the first to bring typological data
to bear on the problem of reconstructing the Proto-Indo-European phonological
system. Taking note of Jakobson's (197Π19571528) remark that:
...no language adds to the pair Iti ~ Idi a voiced aspirate ldhl without having
its voiceless counterpart lthl...
Szemerényi reasoned that since Proto-Indo-European had voiced aspirates, it must
also have had voiceless aspirates. Though on the surface this reasoning appears
sound, it puts too much emphasis on the typological data and too little on the data
from the Indo-European daughter languages. As mentioned above, there are very
cogent reasons for removing the traditional voiceless aspirates from Proto-
Indo-European, and these reasons are not easily dismissed. Szemerényi also tried to
show that Proto-Indo-European had only one laryngeal, namely, the voiceless glottal
fricative Ihi. Szemerenyi's (1967:96—97) reconstruction is as follows:
Ρ t k' k kw
b d g' g gW
bh dh g'h gh gwh
ph th k'h kh kwh
y w I r m η
s h
a e o i u 3
ä è ò ι ü
Szemerényi's reconstruction is in fact typologically natural, and he has defended it
strongly right up to the present day (cf. Szemerényi 1990:37-72). His system — as
well as that of the Neogrammarians, it may be added — is merely a projection
backward in time of the Old Indie phonological system. In certain dialects of
"Disintegrating Indo-European", such a system no doubt existed in point of fact.
Next, there are the proposals put forth by Joseph Emonds (1972). According
2.1. Changing Views on Proto-Indo-European Phonology 43
to Emonds, the plain voiced stops of traditional Proto-Indo-European are to be
reinterpreted as plain lax voiceless stops, while the traditional plain voiceless stops
are taken to have been tense and aspirated:
Emonds regards the voicing of the lax stops as common to a Central innovating area
and the appearance of voiceless stops in Germanic, Armenian, and Hittite as relics.
Similar proposals have been put forth by Griffen (1988:162—189).
There are other problems with the traditional reconstruction besides the
typological difficulties caused by the removal of the voiceless aspirates. Another
problem, noted in most of the standard handbooks (cf., for example, Adrados
1975.1:108; Burrow 1973:73; Krause 1968:116-117; Lehmann 1952:109; Meillet
1964:84 and 89), is the statistically low frequency of occurrence — perhaps total
absence — of the traditional voiced labial stop *b. We may cite Meillet's (1964:89)
comments on this matter:
b is relatively rare; it does not occur in any important suffix nor in any
ending; it is secondary in some of the words where it is found, thus Skt.
pibämi Ί drink', Oír. ibim Ί drink', Lat. bibö (with initial b through
assimilation) is an ancient reduplicated form in view of Skt. pähi 'drink', Gk.
πΐθι, OCS. piti 'to drink', Lat. pöculum 'cup'; ...others are imitative, thus Gk.
βάρβαρος, Lat. balbus, etc.; others are limited to a few languages and give the
impression of being recent borrowings.
The marginal status of *b is difficult to understand from a typological viewpoint and
is totally unexplainable within the traditional framework. This problem was
investigated in 1951 by the Danish scholar Holger Pedersen. Pedersen noted that, in
natural languages having a voicing contrast in stops, if there is a missing member in
the labial series, it is Ipl that is missing and not Ibi. This observation led Pedersen
to suggest that the traditional plain voiced stops might originally have been plain
voiceless stops, while the traditional plain voiceless stops might have been plain
voiced stops:

Later shifts would have changed the earlier plain voiced stops into the traditional
plain voiceless stops and the earlier plain voiceless stops into the traditional plain
voiced stops. In a footnote in his 1953 BSL article entitled "Remarques sur le
consonantisme sémitique", André Martinet (1975[1953]:251—252, fn. 1) objected to
this "musical chairs" rearrangement:
Since there are extremely few examples of the Common Indo-European
phoneme reconstructed "analogically" as *b, it is tempting to diagnose a gap
there also, as the late Holger Pedersen did in Die gemeinindoeuropäischen
und die vorindoeuropäischen Verschlusslaute, pp. 10—16. But, instead of
assuming, as did Pedersen, the loss of a Pre-Indo-European *p followed by a
musical-chairs [rearrangement] of mediae and tenues, one should be able to
see in the series *d, *g, *gw
the result of evolution from an earlier series of
glottalics, without labial representative.
This appears to be the first time that anyone had proposed reinterpreting the
plain voiced stops of traditional Proto-Indo-European as glottalics. Martinet's
observation, however, seems to have influenced neither Gamkrelidze and Ivanov nor
Hopper, each of whom arrived at the same conclusion independently of Martinet as
well as independently of each other.
In the preceding discussion, only the more well-known counterproposals were
mentioned, and only the briefest of explanations were given. More details could
easily have been given. Insights gained from typological studies, for example, could
have been used to strengthen the arguments: no phoneme stands alone; it is, rather,
an integral part of the total system. Each and every phoneme is tied to the other
phonemes in the system by discrete interrelationships — to disturb one phoneme is to
disturb (at least potentially) the entire system. This is basically the message that
Jakobson and Martinet were trying to bring home. All too often, this message is
ignored. Moreover, the interrelationships are not only synchronic, they are
diachronic as well.
Discovery — perhaps "rediscovery" would be a better term since Martinet's
insightful remarks first appeared in 1953 — of what has come to be known as the
"Glottalic Theory" came from two separate sources, each working independently. On
the one-hand, the British-born American Germanist Paul J. Hopper first hit upon
2.1. Changing Views on Proto-Indo-European Phonology 45
the notion that Proto-Indo-European may have had a series of globalized stops
while he was a student at the University of Texas and taking a course in Kabardian
from Aert Kuipers. Hopper went on about other business after graduation, waiting
five years before putting his ideas into writing. On the other hand, the Georgian
Indo-Europeanist Thomas V. Gamkrelidze, a native speaker of a language containing
glottalics (Georgian), had been investigating the typological similarities between
Proto-Kartvelian and Proto-Indo-European (cf. Gamkrelidze 1966 and 1967). It did
not take Gamkrelidze long to realize the possibility that Proto-Indo-European might
also have had glottalized stops. Gamkrelidze, in a joint article with the Russian
Indo-Europeanist Vjaceslav V. Ivanov, was the first to make it into print
(Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1972). Hopper might have beat them into print had his paper
on the subject not been rejected by the journal Language. He was then obliged to
search for another journal willing to publish his views, which finally happened in
1973. Then, in 1973, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov published a German language version
of their 1972 paper.
Hopper (1973:141—166) proposed reinterpreting the plain voiced stops of
traditional Proto-Indo-European — Lehmann's *b, *d, *g, *gw
— as glottalized stops
(ejectives), that is, (*p'), *t\ *k', *k'w
respectively, because the traditional plain
voiced stops
show many of the typological characteristics of glottalized stops (ejectives), e.g.
they are excluded from inflectional affixes, they may not cooccur with another
in the same root, etc.
Hopper also reinterpreted the traditional voiced aspirates as murmured stops.
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1972:15—18 and 1973:150—156) also reinterpret the
traditional plain voiced stops as ejectives, but, unlike Hopper, they reinterpret the
traditional plain voiceless stops as voiceless aspirates. They make no changes to the
traditional voiced aspirates. They point out, however, that the feature of aspiration
is phonemically irrelevant in a system of this type. In a later article, Gamkrelidze
(1976:403) gives the following reconstruction:
Lehmann Gamkrelidze
b bh Ρ p' bh/b ph/p
d dh t t' dh/d th/t
g gh k k' ghlg khlk
gW gWh kw
k'V: g-h/g- k'ihlkt
46 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
According to Gamkrelidze (1981:607), such a system exists in several modern Eastern
Armenian dialects (however, this is challenged by Jahukyan 1990:7—8).
Many of the points discussed above by Gamkrelidze were also noted by
Hopper, in particular the root structure constraint laws (cf. Hopper 1973:158—161).
Hopper also discusses possible trajectories of the new system in various Indo-
European daughter languages.
The system of Gamkrelidze, Hopper, and Ivanov has several clear advantages
over the traditional reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European stop system:
A. Their reinterpretation of the traditional plain voiced stops as glottalics
(ejectives) makes it easy to account for the fact that the phoneme
traditionally reconstructed as *b was highly marked in the system, being
characterized by an extremely low frequency of occurrence (if it even
existed at all). Such a low frequency distribution is extremely
uncharacteristic of the patterning of the voiced labial stop Ibi in natural
languages having a voicing contrast in stops, but it is fully characteristic
of the patterning of the labial ejective Ip'l (cf. Gamkrelidze 1981:
605-606; Greenberg 1970:127).
B. Not only does the reinterpretation of the traditional voiced stops as
ejectives easily account for the frequency distribution of these sounds, it
also explains the fact that they were used only very infrequently in
inflectional affixes and pronouns, since this type of patterning is
characteristic of the way ejectives behave in natural languages having
such sounds.
C. For the first time, the root structure constraint laws can be credibly
explained. These constraints turn out to be a simple voicing agreement
rule with the corollary that two glottalics cannot cooccur in a root.
Hopper (1973:160) cites Hausa, Yucatec Mayan, and Quechua as
examples of natural languages exhibiting a similar constraint against the
cooccurrence of two glottalics. Akkadian may be added to this list as
well if we take Geers' Law to be a manifestation of such a constraint (cf.
Bomhard 1984:135).
D. The so-called Germanic and Armenian "consonant shifts" (in German,
"Lautverschiebungen"), which can only be accounted for very awkwardly
within the traditional framework (cf. Emonds 1972:108—122), turn out to
be mirages. Under the revised reconstruction, these branches (along with
2.2. The Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals Al
the poorly-attested Thracian and Phrygian) turn out to be relic areas.
Applying the revisions proposed by Gamkrelidze, Hopper, and Ivanov, the
Proto-Indo-European phonological system may be reconstructed as follows:
1. Obstruents: pßi tßl kßl
bßi dlh
l glh
l
gw[h]
(Ρ') t' k· k'w
2. Nasals and Liquids: mim
s
nln m. r/r
3. Glides: y w
4. Laryngeals: ? h & W
5. Vowels: e o
ë ö
a
à
i
ι
U 3
M
The nasals and liquids were unique in their ability to function as syllables or
non-syllabics, depending upon their environment. They were non-syllabic (A) when
between vowels or initially before vowels, (B) when preceded by a vowel and
followed by a consonant, and (C) when preceded by a consonant and followed by a
vowel. They became syllabic when the stress-conditioned loss of former contiguous
vowels left them between two non-syllabics:
CaR'Ca > CsR'Ca > CR'Ca
2.2. The Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals
The Indo-European parent language is assumed to have had one or more
sounds conventionally called "laryngeals", though this label refers to these sounds as
a group and is not an indication of their phonetic make-up. The basic (and most
widely-accepted) tenets of the Laryngeal Theory may be summarized as follows:
48 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
A. The Indo-European parent language possessed one or more laryngeals;
most scholars posit either three (Beekes, Benveniste, Burrow, Couvreur,
Cowgill, Keiler, Lejeune) or four distinct laryngeals (Kerns—Schwartz,
Kuryiowicz, Lehmann, Sapir, Sturtevant).
Β. The laryngeals were lost as independent phonemes in all branches of
Indo-European except for Anatolian (cf. Bomhard 1976:222—231 and
1984:119-131; Lehmann 1952:25-28; Puhvel 1965:79-92; Sturtevant
1942:35—65 and 1951:47—55) and Armenian, where the laryngeal *H2
(*a2) appears as h initially before vowels in a small number of words (cf.
Austin 1942:22-25; Bomhard 1976:231-232 and 1984:82-84; Greppin
1981:120-122; Sturtevant 1942:29-30; Winter 1965b:102).
C. The loss of preconsonantal laryngeals after short vowels caused the
compensatory lengthening of these vowels (cf. Benveniste 1935:149;
Bomhard 1984:17; Kuryiowicz 1935:28; Lehmann 1952:85-86; Lindeman
1970:17, 1987:21 and 50-59; Sturtevant 1942:66-71).
D. One or more of the laryngeals had an assimilatory effect on contiguous
vowels (cf. Benveniste 1935:149; Couvreur 1937:69; Lindeman 1970:17
and 1987:22; Sturtevant 1942:35-46).
E. The so-called "long syllabic résonants" (*m, *ñ, *(, *r) are to be
reinterpreted as sequences of *m, *n, */, *r plus laryngeal (cf. Burrow
1973:87; Lehmann 1952:86-90; Lindeman 1987:21-22; Sturtevant
1942:69-71).
F. Some examples of voiceless aspirates in Indo-Aryan owe their origin to
the former presence of a laryngeal between an immediately preceding
plain voiceless stop and an immediately following vowel: *T + *H (*a)
> Th (cf. Kuryiowicz 1935:29; Lehmann 1952:80-84; Lindeman 1970:
77-81 and 1987:88-91; Sturtevant 1942:83-86).
G. Proto-Indo-European had no initial vowels; in every instance where
initial vowels had been reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European by the
Neogrammarians, a preceding laryngeal has been lost (cf. Kuryiowicz
1935:29).
H. The laryngeals could have both syllabic and non-syllabic allophones
2.2. The Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals 49
depending upon their environment (cf. Benveniste 1935:149; Couvreur
1937:303-319; Keiler 1970:70-86). That is to say that the patterning of
the laryngeals was similar to that usually assumed for the résonants. The
syllabic form of the laryngeals is commonly associated with the schwa
primum reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European by the Neogrammarians.
At first glance, the form of the Laryngeal Theory that would seem to conform
best to the evidence found in the daughter languages would appear to be that which
assumes four laryngeals for the Indo-European parent language. Specifically, four
laryngeals seem to be needed for pre-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European and for that
form of Proto-Indo-European existing immediately after the separation of the
Anatolian languages from the main speech community. However, for the
Indo-European antecedent of the non-Anatolian daughter languages ("Disintegrating
Indo-European" or "PIE-Proper"), only one laryngeal is to be reconstructed.
Disintegrating Indo-European must have had the full complement of long and
short vowels traditionally reconstructed (cf. Szemerényi 1967:67—87). Furthermore,
Disintegrating Indo-European must have had initial vowels; to assume otherwise
would be to ignore the evidence of the non-Anatolian daughter languages as well as
to deny the efficacy of the Comparative Method. This can only mean that the
vowel-lengthening and vowel-coloring effects usually attributed to the laryngeals
must have taken place prior to the Disintegrating Indo-European period. On the
surface, it would thus appear as if one could almost get by without positing any
laryngeals at all for this period. At least one laryngeal must be reconstructed for
Disintegrating Indo-European, however, to account for developments in the
non-Anatolian daughter languages such as:
A. The Indo-Aryan voiceless aspirates (cf. Lehmann 1952:80—84).
Β. The Greek prothetic vowels (cf. Austin 1941:83-92; Beekes 1969:18-74;
Cowgill 1965:151-153; Lejeune 1972:204).
C. The Greek rough breathing, in part (cf. Sapir 1938:248-274; Sturtevant
1942:76-78).
D. Armenian initial h, in part (cf. Austin 1942:22-25; Bomhard 1984:82-84;
Greppin 1981:120-122; Sturtevant 1942:29-30; Winter 1965b: 1.02).
E. The Balto-Slavic intonantions (cf. Vaillant 1950:241-246).
F. The Germanic Verschärfung (cf. Jasanoff 1978:77—90; Lehmann 1952:
50 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
36-46 and 1965:213-215; Lindeman 1974).
No doubt, it was this single laryngeal of Disintegrating Indo-European that had a
syllabic allophone.
For pre-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European, four laryngeals would seem to be
needed to account for:
A. Disintegrating Indo-European *e without a corresponding Anatolian
laryngeal reflex (this is Kurylowicz's *3h Sturtevant's *').
B. Disintegrating Indo-European *a with a corresponding Anatolian
laryngeal reflex (this is Kurylowicz's *d2, Sturtevant's *x).
C. Disintegrating Indo-European *e and *o with a corresponding Anatolian
laryngeal reflex (this is Kurylowicz's *33, Sturtevant's *γ). It should be
noted that Kurylowicz assumes that this laryngeal changed a contiguous
*e to *o, while Sturtevant (1938:104-111 and 1942:20) assumes that this
laryngeal did not color contiguous vowels.
D. Disintegrating Indo-European *a without a corresponding Anatolian
laryngeal reflex (this is Kurylowicz's *34, Sturtevant's *: [later */i]).
One of the most difficult riddles to solve has been and continues to be the
determination of the probable phonetic values of the various laryngeals. Several
scholars have addressed this problem: Sturtevant (1942:19), following Sapir, assigns
the following phonetic values to the laryngeals: *' = a glottal stop with frontal
timbre; *: (in later works, Sturtevant writes *h) = a glottal stop with velar timbre;
*x = a voiceless velar spirant; and *y = a voiced velar spirant. According to
Lehmann (1952:103—108), *' was either a weakly aspirated glottal fricative or a
pharyngeal fricative; *h was apparently a glottal aspirated fricative; *x was a
voiceless velar fricative; and *y was a rounded voiced velar fricative. Keiler
(1970:68) posits the following values: *H¡ = a voiceless glottal fricative lh/\ *H2 = a
voiceless pharyngeal fricative IHI\ and *H3 = a voiced pharyngeal fricative /Í7.
Finally, Colarusso (1981:550) assigns the following values: *H¡ = either a glottal stop
or voiceless and voiced pharyngealized velar fricatives; *H2 = voiceless and voiced
pharyngeal fricatives; *H3 = either labialized voiceless and voiced pharyngeal
fricatives or a labialized glottal stop; and *H4 = a voiceless glottal fricative.
According to Colarusso (1981:512), Couvreur (1937:264), and Sturtevant
(1942:19 and 1951:54), *H¡ was a glottal stop. The interpretation of *H¡ as a glottal
stop explains why this laryngeal did not color contiguous vowels. As noted by
2.2. The Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals 51
Catford (1977:105) "simple glottal stop has no influence on the quality of contiguous
vowels". This is verifiable from both Northwest Caucasian and Arabic, where glottal
stops have no effect on vowel quality (cf. Colarusso 1981:511 for Northwest
Caucasian and Al-Ani 1970:60—62 for Arabic). Moreover, loss of a glottal stop
between an immediately preceding short vowel and an immediately following
non-syllabic causes compensatory lengthening of the vowel in Akkadian and Arabic
(cf. Cantineau 1960:79; Couvreur 1937:288-289; Moscati 1964:61-64). Note the
following examples from Akkadian (these are taken from Couvreur 1937:288—289):
A. Akkadian *ra?
su > räsu (later rësu) 'head': Hebrew rós 'head'; Arabic
ra9
s 'head'; Ugaritic ris 'head'; Geez / Ethiopie ra'ds 'head'.
B. Akkadian *rahmu > *rehmu > *re9
mu > rèmu 'grace, mercy': Hebrew
rahüm 'compassionate'; Arabic rahima 'to have mercy, compassion',
rahma 'pity, compassion'; Harsüsi reham 'to pity'; Ugaritic rhm 'to be
kind'; Tigre rähama 'to have pity on' (Arabic loan).
C. Akkadian *baf
lu > *ber
lu > *be7
lu > bëlu 'owner, lord': Hebrew
ba^al 'lord, owner'; Arabic bcfl 'husband, master, owner'; Soqotri
ba?
l 'master, lord'; Ugaritic bc
l 'owner of the house'; Geez / Ethiopie
baç
âl 'owner, master'; Tigrinya bä'-'al, baç
al 'master'.
Identical developments are traditionally assumed for *H¡ in Proto-Indo-European.
This laryngeal is not directly attested in any of the Indo-European daughter
languages, including Hittite (cf. Bomhard 1976:230; Sturtevant 1942:53 and 1951:154).
Additional confirmation that *H ¡ was a glottal stop is provided by Sanskrit
(3rd sg.) pi bat i 'drinks', Latin bibit 'drinks', and Old Irish ibid 'drinks'. The
Proto-Indo-European antecedent would have been *p[h
]i-p[h
]H¡-etlh
]i (or, in
traditional terms, *pi-pd¡-eti), that is, *p[h
li-p[h
I?-et[h
li. Now, according to
Gamkrelidze, Hopper, and Ivanov, glottalized stops become voiced stops in Sanskrit,
Latin, and Old Irish. Likewise, we would expect the cluster *-p[h
]?- to become
Ibi in these languages, and this is exactly what we do in fact find.
Kurylowicz (1935:29—30) sets up *34 (*H4) to account for those cases in which
an a in the non-Anatolian daughter languages corresponds to an a in Hittite, and
Hittite lacks a contiguous laryngeal reflex. That is to say that *H4 is not directly
attested in Hittite or in any of the other daughter languages (cf. Bomhard 1976:230;
Sturtevant 1942:42 and 1951:51—52), though its former presence can be determined
by the fact that it changed a contiguous *e to *a and by the fact that it caused
compensatory vowel lengthening when lost between an immediately preceding short
vowel and an immediately following non-syllabic. According to Hopper
52 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
(1977a:49-50), typological evidence implies that the voiceless laryngeal fricative Ihl
should be added to the Proto-Indo-European phonemic inventory, and this coincides
with the phonetic value assigned to *H4 by Colarusso (1981:512), Lehmann
(1952:108), and (apparently) Sturtevant (1951:52). In terms of distinctive feature
theory, Ihl is [+cons, +low, -voice, +cont, +grave]. As far as we are concerned, the
most important feature is [low]. According to Chomsky and Halle (1968:305), the
articulatory gesture behind the feature [low] is a "lowering [of] the body of the
tongue below the level it occupies in the neutral position", while Colarusso
(1981:509) defines it as "an opening of the oral cavity to enhance resonance". It was
the presence of this feature that was responsible for the lowering of a contiguous
*e to *a. Finally, we may note that developments similar to those assumed for
*H4 in Proto-Indo-European are found in Ubykh and in the Circassian languages,
where Ihl (and lhw
l) lowers and colors contiguous vowels and also causes
compensatory vowel lengthening when lost (cf. Colarusso 1975:396).
Reflexes of *H 2 (*i2) a r
e found in Hittite and the other older Anatolian
languages (that is. Palaie and Cuneiform and Hieroglyphic Luwian), where they are
written (h)h (cf. Bomhard 1976:222-227; Sturtevant 1942:35 and 1951:47). Like
*H4, *H2 lowers a contiguous *e to *a. On this basis, we would expect *H2 also to
be characterized by the presence of the feature [low]. Good candidates to assign as
the phonetic values of *H2 would be the multiply-articulated pharyngeal/laryngeals
Ihhl and /£/?/. Not only are these sounds marked by the presence of the feature
[low], which accounts for the lowering of adjacent vowels, but they also make it
easy to account for the fact that *H2 appears as h in Armenian before full-grade
vowels. We can envision a change of *lhhl into *lhl and of *IVfìl first into *lñl
and then into *lhl similar to what is found in the Ashkharwa dialect of Abkhaz (cf.
Colarusso 1981:516). The resulting *lhl would have been lost in all of the
non-Anatolian daughter languages except pre-Proto-Armenian. As in Ashkharwa,
we may venture a guess that */fthl and *!?§/ developed from the earlier pharyngeals
*lkl and */S7 respectively in pre-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European. Indeed, support
for such an assumption comes from the lexical parallels between Proto-
Indo-European and Proto-Afroasiatic, where Proto-Indo-European *H2 corresponds
to Proto-Afroasiatic *IHI and */?/. Finally, note should be made of Jakobson's
(197111956]:518—520) description of similar sounds in Arabic:
(1971[1956J:518—519:) ... Ihl is essentially a pharyngealized laryngeal. Of the
two phonemes of this type, Ihl is usually produced without voice and l'I with
voice. Since a considerable part of the air used by /'/ is consumed by voicing
alone, this phoneme is a lenis, in contradistinction to the fortis Ihl. Thanks to
the pharyngeal contraction, the voice-pitch in /'/ and the whisper-pitch in Ihl
are very low: "In passing to /'/ from a preceding vowel the voice has to
2.2. The Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals 53
descend rapidly, often through more than an octave, and is cut off at its
lowest pitch. If a vowel follows, the pitch begins at its lowest level and rises
quickly, through a similar interval, to normal vowel pitch." ... (1971[1956]:520:)
As to the influence upon the adjacent vowels, the componential analysis of a
phoneme cannot proceed from the contextual variants of neighboring
phonemes: often the variation is due not to a single feature but to a
combination of concurrent features. Furthermore, in many instances the
pharyngeals modify adjacent vowels in the same direction as pharyngealized
buccals. In colloquial Egyptian both the pharyngealized buccals and the
pharyngeals appear to exert a modifying retracting influence on preceding and
following a-vowels (Gairdner, p. 46f.). In the dialect of El-Hamma, Cantineau
observes that the /a:/ is pronounced "entre α et o ouvert" in contact with
pharyngealized dentals, while in contact with the pharyngeals it is realized as
"a moyen français", in contact with velars it oscillates between the two
positions mentioned, and in other contexts it is a front vowel. In the same
dialect the phoneme /u:/ is shifted towards the closed o in the neighborhood of
pharyngealized dentals, velars, and pharyngeals (1951, p. 78f.).
It is more difficult to determine the phonetic values of *H3 (*a3) than of any
of the other laryngeals. Reflexes of *H3 are also found in the older Anatolian
languages (cf. Bomhard 1976:228-230; Sturtevant 1942:44 and 1951:49-51).
Kurylowicz (1935:28—30) tried to show that *H3 changed a contiguous *e to *o, but
Sturtevant (1938:104—111 and 1942:20) has convincingly argued against such an
assumption. Indeed, forms such as Hittite me-hur 'time' beside Gothic mèi 'time'
and Latin mètior 'to measure', for example, in which the vowel e is found directly
before a laryngeal reflex in Hittite, are difficult to explain if, as claimed by
Kurylowicz, *H3 changed a contiguous *e to *o. Now, comparison with Proto-
Afroasiatic indicates that *H3 corresponds to *h and *f, exactly as does *H2. This is
an important piece of evidence, for, surprisingly, it raises the possibility that
*H2 and *H 3 might have been identical in Proto-Indo-European. Such an
assumption would mean that only one laryngeal, instead of two, was preserved in
the older Anatolian languages. Moreover, by reexaming the relevant data from the
Indo-European daughter languages, we find that the assumption that *H 2 and
*H3 were identical actually provides the key to understanding the full scope of the
vowel-coloring effects of the laryngeals in Proto-Indo-European. We know that
*H2 lowered and colored a contiguous *e to *a. As in the Arabic example discussed
by Jakobson above, we would expect this laryngeal to have had a similar effect on
the vowels *i and *u in early Proto-Indo-European as well. That is to say that we
would expect *H 2 to have lowered and colored a contiguous *i to *e and a
contiguous *u to *o. In fact, there is good evidence within Indo-European itself to
54 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
support this, as the following examples illustrate:
A. Early Proto-Indo-European *H2inkfh
J- > later Proto-Indo-European
*H2enk[h
]~ 'to reach, to come to, to arrive at' (Pokorny 1959:316-318
reconstructs *enek-, *neH-, *ení¿-, *«£-): Hittite (3rd sg.) hi-in-ik-zi 'to
present, to deliver, to offer, to allot'; Sanskrit asnóti 'to reach, to come
to, to arrive at, to get, to obtain; to master; to offer'; Latin nancior 'to
get, to gain, to obtain', nanciscor 'to get, to gain, to receive, to meet';
Tocharian A ents-, Β enk- 'to seize, to take'. Cf. Puhvel 1984- .3:
289-292. The Hittite form directly attests *H2\nk!h
]-.
B. Early Proto-Indo-European *H 2ul- > later Proto-Indo-European
*H2ol- 'to destroy' (Pokorny 1959:777 reconstructs *ol-(e)~): Hittite (3rd
sg.) hu-ul-la-a-i 'to smite, to destroy'; Greek ολλύμι 'to destroy'; Latin
ab-oleö 'to destroy'. Cf. Couvreur 1937:143-144; Cowgill 1965:146-147.
The Hittite form directly attests *H2ul~.
C. Early Proto-Indo-European *H2 um- > later Proto-Indo-European
*//2om-"'all, whole': Hittite (nom. sg.) hu-u-ma-an-za 'all, whole';
Latin omnis 'all, every, whole'. Cf. Couvreur 1937:144—146; Kronasser
1956:41; Pedersen 1938:165. The Hittite form directly attests *H2um~.
This explains the origin of at least some cases of so-called "non-apophonic"
*e and *o. At a later date, secondary e- or o-grade forms (corresponding to
original non-apophonic *o and *e respectively) may have developed in accordance
with the regular *e ~ *o ablaut patterning. Where secondary *e- or *o-grade forms
did not develop, we would have examples of non-apophonic *e or *o, as the case
may be. An important point needs to be made here. *i and *u had more than one
origin in Proto-Indo-European. In some cases *i and *u were original (that is,
inherited from Proto-Nostratic), while, in other cases, they resulted from the
stress-conditioned weakening of *Vy and *Vw respectively. Only original *i and
*u were lowered and colored to *e and *o respectively when contiguous with
*H2 and *H4. When *i and *u resulted from the stress-conditioned weakening of
*Vy and *Vw, however, they were not lowered and colored to *e and *o respec-
tively in the neighborhood of *H 2 and *H4, since such a change would have
disrupted the integrity of the ablaut relationship.
The question of whether or not labialized laryngeals should be reconstructed
for Proto-Indo-European will not be considered here, though there is at least
2.2. The Proto-Indo-European Laryngeals 55
circumstantial evidence that one or more labialized laryngeals may have existed in
the Indo-European parent language (cf. Adrados 1961 and 1964:27—44; Colarusso
1981:503-552; Martinet 1970:212-234 and 1975[1967]:114-143; Puhvel 1965:86-92;
Watkins 1965b:89). We may note in passing that there is even some evidence that
Proto-Indo-European may also have had labialized dentals as well as. a labialized
sibilant (cf. Gamkrelidze-Ivanov 1984.1:122-134).
We may summarize our findings by setting up the following matrix:
hh íñ
Traditional *H ¡ (*a¡) + - -
Traditional *H4 (*a4) - + -
Traditional *H2 (*i¡) - - +
Traditional *HS (*s3) - - +
e lowered and colored to α - + +
i lowered and colored to e - + +
u lowered and colored to o - + +
Preserved in Anatolian +
Partially preserved in Armenian - - +
Now that we have determined the probable phonetic values of the
Proto-Indo-European laryngeals, we can turn to the question of their prehistoric
development.
On the basis of comparison with the other Nostratic languages, especially
Proto-Afroasiatic, the following four laryngeals may be posited for pre-Proto-
Indo-European: */?/, *lhl, */hl, and */S7. At this time, the laryngeals were stable
and non-vowel coloring.
The earliest change to take place was the development of the voiceless and
voiced pharyngeal fricatives *lhl and */?/ into the multiply-articulated pharyngeal/
laryngeals *lhhl and */ΐβ/ respectively. Colarusso (1981:516) cites a similar
development in the Ashkharwa dialect of Abkhaz. These pharyneal/laryngeals, as
also the voiceless laryngeal fricative *lhl, contained the feature [low] as part of the
simultaneous bundle of features characterizing these sounds. These were the
so-called "α-coloring" laryngeals. It was at the end of this stage of development
that the Anatolian languages became separated from the main speech community.
In early post-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European, */?/ and */h/ were lost initially
before vowels, while */ñh/ > */hl and */57i/ > *//}/ > *lh/ in the same environment.
In later post-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European ("Disintegrating Indo-European"), all
56 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
laryngeals first merged into */h/. */h/ (from earlier */ñh/ and */ÎJ/) was then lost
initially before vowels (except in pre-Proto-Armenian) and medially between an
immediately preceding vowel and a following non-syllabic. This latter change
occasioned the compensatory lengthening of preceding short vowels:
eHC > êC
oHC > ôC
aHC > äC
iHC > ïC
uHC > üC
I assume that the single remaining laryngeal, */h/, was, at first, preserved in
all other positions and that it had a syllabic allophone when between two
non-syllabics. It is on the basis of the Armenian evidence that I assume this single
laryngeal to have been a voiceless laryngeal fricative. Szemerényi (1967:89—90),
Vaillant (1950:241-246), and Zgusta (1951:428-472) also agree that the Proto-
Indo-European antecedent of the non-Anatolian daughter languages had only a
single laryngeal and that that laryngeal was a voiceless laryngeal fricative. See also
Collinge 1970b:67-101 and Hammerich 1948.
In closing, we may note that many of the developments posited here for the
Proto-Indo-European laryngeals are similar to developments found in Coptic (cf.
Greenberg 1969:183-184).
2.3. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Indo-European
Before beginning, it is necessary to define several key terms. A "root" may be
defined as the base form of a word. It carries the basic meaning, and it cannot be
further analyzed without loss of identity (cf. Crystal 1980:308). A "stem", on the
other hand, may be defined as an inflectional base. A stem may or may not be
coequal with a root. Cf. Crystal 1980:330-331.
There have been several attempts to formulate the rules governing the
structural patterning of roots in Proto-Indo-European. Without going into details, it
may simply be noted that none of the proposals advanced to date has escaped
criticism, including the theories of Emile Benveniste (1935:147—173, especially pp.
170—171). The problem is complicated by the fact that the form of
Proto-Indo-European traditionally reconstructed — what I call "Disintegrating
Indo-European" — is the product of a very long, largely unknown evolution.
2.3. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Indo-European 57
Disintegrating Indo-European contained the debris of earlier successive periods of
development.
For Disintegrating Indo-European,. Jerzy Kurylowicz's (1935:121) description is
adequate:
... the root is the part of a word (it is a question of only the simple word)
made up of (1) the initial consonant or consonantal group, (2) the fundamental
vowel, (3) the final consonant or consonantal group. — The final group can
consist of no more than two consonantal elements, the first of which has
greater syllabicity than the second. In other words, the first consonantal
element is u, r, I, n, m, while the second is a consonant in the strictest
sense of the term: stop, s, or laryngeal (a¡, 32,
A careful analysis of the root structure patterning led Benve niste to the
discovery of the basic laws governing that patterning. According to Benveniste
(1935:170—171), these laws may be stated as follows (see also Lehmann 1952:17—18):
1. The Indo-European root is monosyllabic, composed of the fundamental
vowel ë between two different consonants.
2. In this constant scheme: consonant plus e plus consonant, the consonants
can be of any order provided that they are different: however, the
cooccurrence of both a voiceless stop and an aspirated voiced stop is
forbidden.
3. The addition of a suffix to the root gives rise to two alternating stem
types: Type I: root in full-grade and accented, suffix in zero-grade;
Type II: root in zero-grade, suffix in full-grade and accented.
4. A single determinative can be added to the suffix, either after the suffix
of stem Type II or, if n, inserted between the root element and the
suffix of stem Type II.
5. Further addition of determinatives or suffixes points to a nominal stem.
Benveniste's views are not necessarily incompatible with those of Kuryiowicz.
These theories can be reconciled by assuming that they describe the root structure
patterning at different chronological stages.
Now, comparison of Proto-Indo-European with the other Nostratic languages,
especially Proto-Kartvelian and Proto-Afroasiatic, allows us to refine Benveniste's
58 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
theories. The most ancient patterning was probably as follows:
1. There were no initial vowels in the earliest form of pre-Proto-Indo-
European. Therefore, every root began with a consonant.
2. Originally, there were no initial consonant clusters either. Consequently,
every root began with one and only one consonant.
3. Two basic syllable types existed: (A) *CV and (B) *CVC, where C = any
non-syllabic and V = any vowel. Permissible root forms coincided
exactly with these two syllable types.
4. A verbal stem could either be identical with a root or it could consist of
a root plus a single derivational morpheme added as a suffix to the root:
*CVC-VC~. Any consonant could serve as a suffix.
5. Nominal stems, on the other hand, could be further extended by
additional suffixes.
At this time, there were three fundamental stem types: (A) verbal stems, (B)
nominal and adjectival stems, and (C) pronominal and indeclinable stems.
The phonemicization of a strong stress accent disrupted the patterning outlined
above. The positioning of the stress was morphologically distinctive, serving as a
means to differentiate grammatical categories. All vowels were retained when
stressed but were either weakened (= "reduced-grade") or totally eliminated (=
"zero-grade") when unstressed: the choice between the reduced-grade versus the
zero-grade depended upon the position of the unstressed syllable relative to the
stressed syllable as well as upon the laws of syllabicity in effect at that time.
Functionally, reduced-grade and zero-grade were identical. Finally, it was at this
stage of development that the syllabic allophones of the résonants came into being.
The stress-conditioned ablaut alternations gave rise to two distinct forms of
extended stems:
Type 1: Root in full-grade and accented, suffix in zero-grade: *CVCC~.
Type 2: Root in zero-grade, suffix in full-grade and accented: *CCVC~.
When used as a verbal stem, Type 1 could undergo no further extension. However,
Type 2 could be further extended by means of a "determinative". Further addition
of a determinative or suffixes pointed to a nominal stem (cf. Benveniste 1935:171;
2.3. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Indo-European 59
Lehmann 1952:17). According to Benveniste (1935:148), a "suffix" was characterized
by the fact that it had two alternating forms (*-et-/*-t-, *-en-/*-n~, *-ek-/*-k~,
etc.), while a "determinative" was characterized by a fixed consonantal form (*-t~,
*-«-, *-k~, etc.). Finally, Benveniste (1935:164) notes:
... in the numerous cases where the initial [consonant group has been
reconstructed in the shape] *(s)k-, *(s)t-, *(s)p~, etc., with unstable sibilant, it
is generally a question of prefixation, and it may be observed that the root
begins with the [plain] consonant [alone excluding the sibilant].
In the earliest form of Proto-Indo-European, ablaut was merely a phonological
alternation. During the course of its development, however, Proto-Indo-European
gradually grammaticalized these ablaut alternations. (The origin and development of
the Proto-Indo-European vowel system and ablaut patterning is dealt with in section
2.5. [pp. 73-831.)
Proto-Indo-European had constraints on permissible root structure sequences.
These constraint laws may be stated as follows (cf. Hopper 1973:158—161, §3.2.6;
Gamkrelidze 1976:404-405 and 1981:608-609):
1. Each root contained at least one non-glottalic consonant.
2. When both obstruents were non-glottalic, they had to agree in voicing.
The Proto-Indo-European root structure constraint laws thus become merely a
voicing agreement rule with the corollary that two glottalics cannot cooccur in a
root. Comparison of Proto-Indo-European with the other branches of Nostratic
indicates, however, that the forbidden root types must have once existed. Two rules
may be formulated to account for the elimination of the forbidden types:
1. A rule of progressive voicing assimilation may be set up to account for
the elimination of roots whose consonantal elements originally did not
agree in voicing: *T ~ *B > *T ~ *P, *B ~ *T > *B ~ *D, etc.
2. A rule of regressive deglottalization may be set up to account for the
elimination of roots containing two glottalics: *T' ~ *K' > *T ~ *K', etc.
This rule finds a close parallel in Geers' Law in Akkadian.
According to Gamkrelidze (1976:404 and 1981:608), Bartholomae's Law is a
later manifestation of the progressive voicing assimilation rule, applied to contact
sequences.
60 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
2.4. Remarks on the Proto-Indo-European Consonant System
According to the Neogrammarian reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European
phonological system, the stop system was characterized by a four-way contrast of (1)
plain (that is, unaspirated) voiceless stops, (2) aspirated voiceless stops, (3) plain (that
is, unaspirated) voiced stops, and (4) aspirated voiced stops (cf. Brugmann 1904:52),
thus:
1 2 3 4
Ρ ph b bh (labial)
t th d dh (dental)
£ Ich 8 gh (palatal
Q qh 8 Φ (velar)
q* q>ih β» g<ìh (labiovelar)
The traditional voiceless aspirates (series 2 above) were originally posited by
the Neogrammarians mainly on the basis of the following correspondences from
Indo-Iranian, Armenian, and Greek:
Sanskrit Avestan Iranian Armenian Greek
ph f f pt> φ
th θ θ th τ
kh χ χ χ χ
In the remaining daughter languages, the traditional voiceless aspirates and
plain voiceless stops have the same treatment, except that *kh > χ in Slavic. In
Armenian, the dental voiceless aspirate and plain voiceless dental stop have the same
treatment (except after r), and the same appears to have also been the case in
Greek, at least superficially.
As previously noted, current thinking on the part of a great many Indo-
Europeanists is that the traditional voiceless aspirates should not be reconstructed for
the Indo-European parent language, being secondarily derived in the daughter
languages, and, in a great many cases, it is clear that the reflexes found in the
2.4. Remarks on the Proto-Indo-European Consonant System 61
daughter languages can indeed be derived secondarily from earlier clusters of
voiceless stop plus a following laryngeal (as first suggested in 1891 by de Saussure):
*pH > Sanskrit ph, etc.
*tH > Sanskrit th, etc.
*kH > Sanskrit kh, etc.
As far as the alleged Greek reflex of the traditional dental voiceless aspirate is
concerned, we are mostly dealing, in the available Greek examples, with forms in
which an earlier laryngeal did not occur. In the Sanskrit cognates, on the other
hand, there was an earlier laryngeal, and this has left a trace in the form of
aspiration. A couple of examples will illustrate the difference between Greek and
Sanskrit here:
A. Greek πλατύς 'wide, broad, flat, level' (< pre-Greek *pitá-s) versus
Sanskrit prthú-h 'wide, broad' (< pre-Sanskrit *pltHú-s). There simply
was no laryngeal in the pre-Greek ancestor of the Greek form, and,
hence, there is no aspiration in Greek.
B. Greek (Doric) ϊσχάμι Ί stand' (< pre-Greek *si-steA-mi) versus Sanskrit
tisthati 'stands' (< pre-Sanskrit *(s)ti-tA-eti). In this example, Greek
has full-grade of the root, and Sanskrit has zero-grade.
There is, however, at least one example in which Greek θ corresponds to
Sanskrit th, namely, the second singular perfect ending found, for instance, in Greek
(ρ)οΓσ-θα, Sanskrit vét-tha from earlier *-tAe.
Unfortunately, the laryngeal explanation does not account for the origin of all
examples of voiceless aspirates in the daughter languages. There are several words
of onomatopoeic origin that contain reflexes of earlier voiceless aspirates. Among
these are (cf. Meillet 1984:80-81):
A. Sanskrit kákhati 'laughs', Armenian xaxankh
'guffaw', Greek καχάζω Ί
laugh', Old Church Slavic xoxofb 'guffaw', Latin cachinno Ί laugh'.
Β. Sanskrit phût-karoti 'puffs, blows', Armenian ph
ukh
'breath, puff,
62 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Greek φϋσα (< *φϋΐί α) 'a pair of bellows', Lithuanian püsti 'to blow
(air)'.
A laryngeal explanation is to be ruled out here. Even though laryngeals cannot
account for the presence of aspiration in these forms, the treatment here is identical
to that occurring in the examples where the reflexes of earlier voiceless aspirates are
to be derived, at the Proto-Indo-European level, from clusters of voiceless stop plus
a following laryngeal.
Since there is no evidence that the traditional voiceless aspirates were involved
in marking distinctive contrasts at the Proto-Indo-European level and since these
sounds can be mostly secondarily derived in the Indo-European daughter languages,
there is little justification for reconstructing the traditional voiceless aspirates as a
separate series in the Indo-European parent language.
On the basis of the reflexes found in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Baltic, and Slavic,
the Neogrammarians (as well as August Schleicher before them) posited a series of
plain (unaspirated) voiceless stops for series 1 at the Proto-Indo-European level.
The evidence of Germanic, Celtic, and Armenian (along with the poorly-attested
Thracian and Phrygian), however, points to the presence of aspiration in this series
in Proto-Indo-European. Two explanations were available to the Neogrammarians
to account for the reflexes found in the various daughter languages: (A) loss of
aspiration in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Baltic, and Slavic or (B) secondary development
of aspiration in Germanic, Celtic, Armenian, Thracian, and Phrygian. The
Neogrammarians chose the second alternative (cf., for example, Meillet 1984:91—92),
and this view has been followed by most scholars until fairly recently. However,
the first alternative should not be so quickly dismissed. Let us take a closer look at
the developments found in the daughter languages.
In Germanic, the traditional plain voiceless stops are represented by voiceless
fricatives, which are assumed to have developed from earlier voiceless aspirates (cf.
Meillet 1984:91), thus:
ρ t k kw
> ph th kh kw
h > f θ χ xw
At a later date, medial (and final) */, *θ, *χ, *xw, together with *s, became the
voiced fricatives */3, *3, *y, *yw, and *z respectively except (A) before *s or *t and
(B) between vowels when the accent fell on the contiguous preceding syllable
(Verner's Law).
In Celtic, the traditional plain voiceless stops are assumed to have developed
2.4. Remarks on the Proto-Indo-European Consonant System 63
into voiceless aspirates, thus:
ρ t k kw
> ph th kh kw
h
The labial member was eventually lost, thus:
ph > h > 0
The Armenian developments can be explained by assuming that, in pre-
Armenian Proto-Indo-European, series 1 was voiceless and aspirated, series 2 were
clusters of voiceless stop plus a following laryngeal, series 3 was globalized, and
series 4 was voiced and aspirated:
Pre-Armenian Armenian
1 ph; fÄ; kyh- Ich > h (w, 0); th; s; kh
2 pH; tH; kH > ph
; t\ χ
3 p'\ r'; k'y·, *k' > p; t; c; k
4 bh
; dh; gyh
; gh > b (w); d; j (z); g ( / , ζ)
In Armenian, some of the reflexes of series 1 merged with the reflexes of
series 2. This happened in the case of the onomatopoeic terms discussed above,
where, for example, earlier *ph
and *kh
became ph
and χ respectively in Armenian
as if from earlier *pH and *kH (this also occurred for all of series 1 in Sanskrit and
Greek, while in Slavic it only took place in the case of *kh
). In like manner, the
aspiration of series 1 was preserved in Armenian after initial s~. *th and *tH have
mostly merged in Armenian, though earlier *rt>l
became rd, while *rtH became
rth (cf. Meillet 1984:79).
Thus, the Germanic, Celtic, and Armenian developments can be explained by
assuming that series 1 was voiceless and aspirated at the Proto-Indo-European level,
that is to say, it is not necessary to posit earlier plain voiceless stops to account for
the developments in these branches. Armenian is particularly important in that it
has preserved the contrast between the older voiceless aspirates (series 1) and those
that developed at a later date from former clusters of voiceless stop plus a following
64 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
laryngeal (series 2).
In Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Baltic, and Slavic, series 1 is represented by plain
voiceless stops. This, however, is not the original patterning but is, rather, an
innovation. Here, Armenian provides the key to understanding the developments in
these branches. On the basis of the Armenian evidence, series 1 may be assumed to
have originally been voiceless and aspirated. Furthermore, following the views of
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, it may be assumed that the aspiration was phonemically
non-distinctive. There were thus two allophones:
ph ~ Ρ
[h „ t
kh - k
lewh - kw
In Sanskrit, the allophones of series 1 became phonemic — the aspirated
allophone appeared in onomatopoeia and after initial s-, while the unaspirated
allophones appeared in all other environments. A few examples will illustrate the
treatment of series 1 after initial s- in Sanskrit:
A. Sanskrit sphuràti 'to dart, to bound, to rebound, to spring; to tremble, to
throb, to quiver, to palpitate, to twitch (as the nerves of the arm), to
struggle', spharati 'to expand, to diffuse widely': Armenian sph
rem 'to
spread, to scatter', ph
arat 'scattered'.
B. Sanskrit sthágati 'to cover, to hide, to conceal': Greek στέγω (and τέγω)
'to cover closely (so as to keep water either out or in)'; Latin tegô 'to
cover'.
C. Sanskrit skhälämi 'to stumble, to stick fast, to go wrong': Armenian
sxalim 'to go wrong, to stumble, to err, to sin'.
Emonds (1972:120) also assumes that the voiceless aspirates found in Indie,
Greek, and Armenian have developed from series 1:
Finally, NIE [New Indo-European] allows us to view the development of
the tense, voiceless aspirates in Indie and Greek in new light. I am not
2.4. Remarks on the Proto-Indo-European Consonant System 65
denying, however, that credible theories about their origin have been advanced
in terms of TIE [Traditional Indo-European] (by the introduction of laryngeals,
etc.). However, the presence of voiceless aspirates in NIE (the ph-series)
suggests as one possibility an imperfect operation of LAX or Z2 in just those
languages where some laxing took place, but in which all aspirated stops were
not eliminated by CG. (By "imperfect operation", I mean the existence of a
dialect in which the rule failed to operate, the dialect later dying out after
contributing a number of "exceptions" to the previously completed historical
change.)
If such imperfect operation of Z2 took place, it would account for Indie
and Greek ph's that correspond to p's in the central group and ph's in
Germanic... The fact that the ph's and x's that occur in the Armenian (and
Slavic) examples do not correspond to the regular development of NIE ph and
kh in those languages supports the notion that "imperfect operation" of Z2
should be reinterpreted as reintroduction of words from a dialect that did not
undergo Z2 (or other rules that affected Armenian and Slavic development of
ph and kh).
Whereas Emonds sees the voiceless aspirated reflexes of series 1 in Sanskrit, Greek,
and Armenian as due to borrowings, I see them as the natural result of the
phonemicization of the allophones of this series.
We can now return to the question of the choices that were available to the
Neogrammarians: (A) loss of aspiration in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Baltic, and Slavic
or (B) secondary development of aspiration in Germanic, Celtic, and Armenian. In
view of the new theory proposed by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, it is not so much a
question of loss or retention as it is of the phonemicization and generalization of the
allophones of series 1 in the various daughter languages, though Germanic, Celtic,
and Armenian come closer to the original patterning than do those daughter
languages in which series 1 is represented by plain voiceless stops, since the aspirated
allophones seem to have been primary at the Proto-Indo-European level. In this
sense, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Baltic, and Slavic have innovated by generalizing the
unaspirated allophones of series 1 (for details on the developments leading to loss of
aspiration in these daughter languages, cf. Suzuki 1985:285—294; for a discussion of
the Sanskrit developments, cf. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1984.1:52—58; for Greek, cf.
Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1984.1:58—64; for Italic, cf. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1984.1:64—74;
and, for Baltic and Slavic, cf. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1984.1:74—78).
According to the traditional reconstruction, series 4 is assumed to have been
voiced and aspirated in Proto-Indo-European. The evidence for voicing is
overwhelming (Indo-Iranian, Albanian, Armenian, Germanic, Celtic, Baltic, and
Slavic), while that for aspiration is limited, coming mainly from Indo-Aryan, Greek,
66 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
and (perhaps) Armenian. Nevertheless, the assumption that this series was voiced
and aspirated at the Proto-Indo-European level remains the best way to account for
the reflexes found in all of the daughter languages taken together.
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov also assume that series 4 was voiced and aspirated.
They point out, however, that the feature of aspiration was phonemically irrelevant
and that this series could appear either with or without aspiration depending upon
the paradigmatic alternation of root morphemes. Specifically, the distributional
patterning of the allophones was as follows, at least in Indo-Iranian and Greek (cf.
Gamkrelidze 1976:404):
In particular, when phonemes of [series 4] co-occurred in a root, one of
the units was realized as an aspirate, the other as a non-aspirate. Thus, e.g., a
root morpheme l*bh
eudh
~l would be manifested as l*beudh
~\ or [*bh
eud-_I
according to the paradigmatic alternations of the morpheme. Grassmann's Law
should be accordingly interpreted not as a deaspiration rule operating
independently in Indo-Iranian and Greek, but as a rule of allophonic
variations, still at the Proto-Indo-European level, of the phonemes of [series 41
The same assumption could easily, and in a natural way, account for the
phenomena described by Bartholomae's Law. A morphemic sequence of
/*bhudh-/ and /*-th
o-/ would be realized as [*budh~] + [*-th0-\ > [*budth0-]
(in accordance with the rule of non-cooccurrence in a sequence, either distant
or in contact, of two aspirated allophones), this yielding Old Indian buddha,
by progressive assimilation on the feature of voice.
In Italic, however, the development of series 4 differs from what is found in
Sanskrit and Greek. As in Greek, the voiced aspirates were, at first, devoiced,
resulting in voiceless aspirates. Then, these voiceless aspirates became voiceless
fricatives, thus:
bh > ph > φ > f
dh > th > θ > f
gh > kh > χ > h
çwh > lewh > xw > f
In Latin (but not Osean and Umbrian), the voiceless fricatives were preserved
initially, but, medially, they first developed into the corresponding voiced fricatives,
which then yielded voiced stops (cf. Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1984.1:64—65).
In an important study on the hierarchical correlation of elements in a
2.4. Remarks on the Proto-Indo-European Consonant System 67
phonological system, Gamkrelidze (1978:9—46) has shown that stops and fricatives
arrange themselves into definite hierarchical relationships based upon their relative
frequency of occurrence. The more common, more usual, more frequent a sound,
the less marked it is in relationship to other sounds, which are less common, less
usual, less frequent, that is, more marked. The various hierarchies established by
Gamkrelidze were arrived at by investigating the frequency distribution of sounds in
a great number of languages. These hierarchical relationships are found to be
characteristic of language in general and not language specific, the underlying
reasons being phonetic — the distinctive features making up the unmarked sounds
simply combine with each other into simultaneous bundles more easily than do the
distinctive features making up marked sounds. Finally, Gamkrelidze notes that,
when there are gaps or empty slots in a system, they invariably occur al the point of
articulation of the most highly marked member in the hierarchy.
The following is one of the hierarchies established by Gamkrelidze:
Ibi -> Ipl Iphi Ip'l
The arrows indicate the direction of greater markedness; that is to say, Ibi is the
most common, most usual, most frequent, hence least marked member; Ipl is less
common than Ibi but more common than Ip^l and Ip'l·, Ip^l is less common than
Ibi and Ipl but more common than Ip'l·, and, finally, Ip'l is the least common,
hence, most marked member. Since gaps occur at the position of the most highly
marked member, if there is a gap in this series, it will be Ip'l that will be missing
(cf. here also Greenberg 1970:127).
Gamkrelidze's findings have important implications for Proto-Indo-European.
As pointed out in the standard handbooks, the phoneme traditionally reconstructed
as *b was a marginal sound of extremely limited occurrence, if it even existed at all.
As we have seen from the typological evidence discussed above, such a frequency
distribution is not at all characteristic of Ibi. Rather, the frequency distribution
points to the original non-voiced character of this sound in Proto-Indo-European.
Further investigation reveals other anomalies in the whole series traditionally
reconstructed as plain voiced stops (series 3 in the chart of the Neogrammarian
reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European stop system [p. 60D. First, all of these
sounds — not just *b — were characterized by a lower frequency of occurrence
relative to the traditional plain voiceless stops (series 1) and voiced aspirates (series
4). Next, the plain voiced stops were rarely found in inflectional endings and
pronouns. Finally, two plain voiced stops could not cooccur in a root. The
frequency distribution of these sounds plus their limited role in the system in general
68 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
makes the traditional reconstruction highly suspect from a typological point of view.
These are the observations that led Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, as well as
Hopper, to reinterpret the traditional plain voiced stops as glottalics (ejectives). Not
only does such a reinterpretation easily account for the frequency distribution of
these sounds, it also explains the fact that they were used only very infrequently in
inflectional affixes and pronouns, since this type of patterning is characteristic of the
way ejectives behave in natural languages having such sounds. Finally, the
constraint against the cooccurrence of two ejectives in a root is found in a number
of languages with ejectives (cf. Hopper 1973:160).
There is no uniform treatment of the ejectives in the Indo-European daughter
languages. In some cases, plain voiceless stops are found, while in others, there are
plain voiced stops. To understand the types of changes ejectives can undergo, the
developments found in the Afroasiatic daughter languages may be looked at. The
following developments are attested (using the dentals for purposes of illustration):
(A) deglottalization *t' > t (Neo-Aramaic dialect of Tür-'Abdin and Ancient
Egyptian); (B) voicing *t' > *cC (> *<f > *d >) d (initially in the Southern Cushitic
languages Iraqw, Burunge, Alagwa, and K'wadza and medially in the East Chadic
language Tumak); (C) retention *t' > t' (modern South Arabian languages and the
Semitic languages of Ethiopia); (D) pharyngealization *t' > ta
, da
(the Berber
languages and Arabic); (E) voicing to implosive *t' > *d (Proto-Chadic and
Proto-East Cushitic); and (F) voicing to retroflex *t' > *d~ > *cf > d (Somali).
According to Colarusso (1975:82-83 and 1981:479-480), in some dialects of the
Northwest Caucasian language Abaza, plain voiced stops correspond to ejectives in
Standard Abaza. Colarusso suggests that the ejectives may have passed through the
following progression: globalized > creaky voice > full voice (see also
Gamkrelidze—Ivanov 1973:154). In support of this suggestion, he notes that the
ejective series has creaky voicing in Kabardian.
The Germanic, Armenian, Tocharian, and Anatolian developments are
straightforward: deglottalization. In Baltic, Slavic, Celtic, and Albanian, the
glottalics merged with the traditional voiced aspirates. In Indo-Iranian, Greek, and
Italic, however, the glottalics became plain voiced stops but did not merge with the
voiced aspirated allophones of series 4 (that is, series 3 and 4 remained separate).
As noted above, the sound traditionally reconstructed as *b may have been
non-existent in Proto-Indo-European. Under the revised interpretation, this sound
would would have been a labial ejective *p'. Had this sound existed in the
Indo-European parent language, it would have developed into Ibi in those daughter
languages that have changed the ejectives into voiced stops. In the case of Sanskirt
(3rd sg. pres.) pibati 'drinks', Latin bibit 'drinks', Old Irish ibid 'drinks', from
Proto-Indo-European *p[h]i-p[h
]?-etih
]i (traditional *pi-pd¡-eti), there is direct
evidence for such a development. While it is common for languages having
2.4. Remarks on the Proto-Indo-European Consonant System 69
ejectives to have a gap at the point of articulation of the labial member, no known
natural language with a voicing contrast in stops has a gap at the point of
articulation of the voiced labial. Since, the normal development of the Disintegrating
Indo-European phonological system in Greek, Italic, and Indo-Iranian would have
created such a gap, a voiced labial was introduced in these branches by various
means. In Greek, the glottalized labiovelar *k'w
developed into Ibi (written β)
under certain conditions. This is the regular development in Osean and Umbrian.
In Latin, Ibi arose from medial *f and from earlier *θ when before or after Irl,
before III, or after lui. In Indo-Aryan, Ibi arose from lbh
l through the change
described by Grassmann's Law (as reinterpreted by Gamkrelidze 1976:404). Finally,
the gap was filled in all three branches through borrowings.
Under the traditional reconstruction, the Germanic and Armenian "sound shifts"
are anomalous (for discussion, cf. Meillet 1967:116—124 and 1984:89—96). Nothing
quite the same exists in any of the other daughter languages (except, probably, the
poorly-attested Thracian and Phrygian). There is, of course, Tocharian, but the
changes there are different in that the opposition between the traditional plain
voiceless, plain voiced, and voiced aspirated stops is completely eliminated (cf.
Krause—Thomas 1960:64; Van Windekens 1976—1982.1:76), while in Germanic and
Armenian, the opposition remains intact. The Germanic and Armenian
developments cannot have been due to a common innovation since there is no
indication that these two branches were ever in contact. Under the new
reconstruction proposed by Gamkrelidze, Hopper, and Ivanov, these branches are to
be seen as relic areas. In fact, they provide a key piece of evidence in support of
the Glottalic Theory.
Pre-divisional Proto-Indo-European may be assumed to have had two types of
gutturals: (A) plain velars and (B) labiovelars. The latter type was characterized by
a secondary articulation of labialization that served to maximize the distinction
between this series and the plain velars.
It has often been assumed that Proto-Indo-European had three guttural series:
(A) palatals, (B) velars, and (C) labiovelars. This theory, however, is without
foundation. In the first place, such a theory would force us to assume that there
was a common innovation in the Proto-Indo-European antecedent of the
centum languages in which the palatals merged with the velars. There is absolutely
no evidence whatsoever that such a merger has taken place. Furthermore, the
palatals can be shown to have become phonemic only in the Proto-Indo-European
antecedent of the satam languages (cf. Lehmann 1952:8; Meillet 1964:94—95).
Finally, it is not necessary to set up a third series to account for cases in which
velars in the satam languages correspond to velars in the centum languages, since
these examples can be explained equally well by assuming just two series (cf.
Burrow 1973:76—77). This subject is discussed with great lucidity by Meillet
70 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
(1964:93—94), who notes that the cases in which velars in the centum languages
correspond to velars in the sat9m languages occur in certain specific environments:
(A) before *a, (B) before *r, (C) after *s, and (D) at the end of roots, especially
after *u. Meillet sums up his discussion of the gutturals by noting that the velars
were simply preserved in certain positions and palatalized in others.
In his cross-linguistic study of palatalization, Bhat (1978:60—67) discusses
palatalizing environments. He notes:
The most prominent environment that could enduce palatalization in a
consonant is a following front vowel (especially the high- and mid-front
unrounded vowels i and e), and a following palatal semivowel (yod). These
are reported to be effective in palatalizing a preceding consonant in almost all
of the languages examined by us. A following yod is more effective on
apicals, whereas a following vowel, especially stressed, is more effective on
velars-
Velars may also be palatalized by a following low front vowel, as for
example, in ENGLISH (before ae, aè also) and in FRENCH (dialectally before
a also). In RUSSIAN, all consonants were palatalized before ae... Similarly,
the apicals may be palatalized by a following high back vowel or semivowel
as seen in PAPAGO, TEPEHUAN, BASQUE, and others-
There are only a limited number of instances in which a front vowel (or
high back vowel) is reported to have palatalized a following consonant.
That is to say that, while the latter does in fact occur (Bhat discusses several
examples), it is a far less frequently attested phenomenon than the palatalization of a
preceding consonant. Bhat (1978:66—67) also discusses the fact that certain
environments may block palatalization:
a. We have noted only two environments that could be specified as
capable of blocking palatalization. They are (1) an apical trill or tap, and (2) a
retroflex consonant. Both these could prevent palatalization of a velar
consonant, that is, they could block the tongue fronting tendency of a given
environment...
b. However, in the case of apical sibilants, r appears to induce
palatalization (raising)...
c. There are a few additional environments that appear to block
palatalization, as for example, a following uvular fricative in EASTERN
ARMENIAN..., a following t or s in AKAN..., or the occurrence of the initial
position in AMHARIC...
2.4. Remarks on the Proto-Indo-European Consonant System 71
Palatalization of velars is an extremely common phenomenon and can be
observed in the historical development of many languages. We can take the
developments in the Romance languages as an example. Classical Latin had the
following gutturals (cf. Sturtevant 1940:165-170):
Velars: c, k Ikl g Igl
Labiovelars: qu lkw
/ gu lgw
l
Somewhere around the beginning of the third century CE, Ikl and Igl were
palatalized to Ikyl and Igyl respectively before e, ae, è, i, and l (cf. Elcock
1960:53-55). Ikyl and Igyl then became Ity/ and Idyl respectively and then Itpl
and Idzyl. Itjy/ developed into French Isl, Spanish (Castilian) ΙΘΙ (dialectal Isl),
Portuguese Isl, Italian Its/, and Romanian ItsI. It should be noted thai Sardinian is
a relic area in which Ikl and Igl were not palatalized. Idzyl developed into French
/z/, Spanish //'/, Portuguese Iii, Italian Idil, and Romanian Idil.
There has also been a general delabialization of lkw
l and lgw
l in the Romance
languages, especially before front vowels. For details about the development of the
gutturals in the Romance languages, cf. Mendeloff 1969:16—31.
The comparative evidence allows us to reconstruct the following gutturals for
pre-divisional Proto-Indo-European:
Plain Velars: k[h] k' gih
]
Labiovelars: k'w
gw
ßl
The Anatolian data are particularly important here. The older Anatolian languages
show no trace of either palatalization of the velars or of delabialization of the
labiovelars (cf. Bomhard 1976:218-220, Kronasser 1956:64-68, and Sturtevant
1951:55—59 for examples). Therefore, we can say with some confidence that
pre-Anatolian Proto-Indo-European had only two phonemic guttural series and that
the phonemicization of a separate palatal series and the delabialization of the
labiovelars must have taken place after the separation of the Anatolian languages
from the main speech community.
The gutturals probably developed as follows: The velars had non-phonemic
palatalized allophones when contiguous with front vowels and apophonic *o as well
as before *y (and perhaps in some cases even before *a). In the Disintegrating
Indo-European antecedent of the satsm languages, the labiovelars were — perhaps
72 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
only partially at first - delabialized. The newly delabialized labiovelars merged
with the unpalatalized allophones of the plain velars. This change then brought
about the phonemicization of the palatalized allophones of the plain velars, since
both palatalized and unpalatalized velars (the latter from earlier labiovelars) were
now found in the vicinity of front vowels, apophonic *o, and *y. Thus, the
Disintegrating Indo-European antecedent of the satam languages had the following
gutturals:
These changes probably began in the Disintegrating Indo-European antecedent of
Indo-Iranian and then spread outward to pre-Baltic, pre-Slavic, pre-Armenian, and
pre-Albanian (cf. Szemerényi 1972a: 129). The fact that the various sat am languages
sometimes show a different treatment for the labiovelars as opposed to the plain
velars seems to indicate that the delabialization of the labiovelars may not have been
carried through to completion until after the emergence of the individual
sat am daughter languages (cf. Szemerényi 1972a: 128). Since the labiovelars did not
become delabialized in the Disintegrating Indo-European antecedents of the
centum languages, there was no impetus for the phonemicization of the palatals in
these languages.
Even though the Guttural Theory outlined above cannot explain every
example, it has, nevertheless, the advantage of being able to account for the greatest
number of developments. Moreover, it is fully compatible with everything we
know about sound change and has historically-attested parallels in natural languages.
Cf. Georgiev 1966:22-34 and 1981:41-62 as well as Meillet 1964:91-95 and
1967:68—73 for essentially the same conclusions about the development of the
gutturals - see also Lehmann 1993:100-101, §5.2.3.
Postvelars (or uvulars) have also been posited for Proto-Indo-European by
several scholars, the most recent being Normier (1977:174—175) and Gamkrelidze—
Ivanov (1984.1:129—134). In my opinion, these theories are not without merit.
However, since I do not at present believe that there were more than two guttural
series — plain velars and labiovelars — at any time in the prehistory of Proto-
Indo-European that can be recovered by a comparison of the extant daughter
languages, the postvelars, if they ever existed, must have been lost at some time
well before the earliest period of Proto-Indo-European proper.

2.5. The Proto-Indo-European Vowel System 73
2.5. The Proto-Indo-European Vowel System
The first attempt to reconstruct the Proto-Indo-European vowel system was
made by August Schleicher. Schleicher's system was as follows (1876:11):
Original First Second
Vowel Increment Increment
A. a-grade a a + a = aa a + aa = äa
B. i-grade i a + i = ai a + ai = ài
C. u-grade u a + u = au a + au = äu
Even though Schleicher's system, which was modeled after that of Old Indie, was
able to account for many of the developments found in the daughter languages,
there remained many unsolved problems, and his system did not endure the
onslaughts of a series of brilliant discoveries in the seventies of the last century by a
new generation of scholars, the so-called "Neogrammarians".
Perhaps the most important discovery of the Neogrammrian period was the
"Law of Palatals", according to which an original *k, for example developed into
c in Old Indie under the influence of a following *ë, *ί, or *y. This discovery
firmly established the primacy of the vowels systems found in the European
daughter languages and proved that the Indo-Iranian system had resulted from an
innovation in which original *ë, *ô, and *ä had merged into *ä. Also important
was the demonstration that the Indo-European parent language had syllabic liquids
and nasals.
According to the Neogrammarians (see especially Brugmann 1904:66—90 and
Hübschmann 1885), Proto-Indo-European had the following vowel system:
Monophthongs: a e 0 i u 3
à è ö ι ü
Diphthongs: ai ei oi pi au eu ou 3U
ài ëi öi äu ëu öu
Syllabic Liquids and Nasals: r l m η h a
r Î ñ fi ñ
74 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
During the past half century or so, the Neogrammarian view has been steadily
attacked. It was dealt its first major blow in 1927 with Kurylowicz's demonstration
that one of de Saussure's "coefficents sonantiques" was preserved in Hittite. In one
fell swoop, the so-called "original" long vowels (as well as the long syllabic nasals
and liquids) were eliminated as was *a, which was taken to result from *e when
next to an "α-coloring" laryngeal, and non-apophonic *o, which was taken to result
from *e when next to an "o -coloring" laryngeal. The next to go were the
diphthongs, which were reanalyzed as clusters of vowel plus non-syllabic resonant
and non-syllabic resonant plus vowel (cf. Lehmann 1952:10—14). The independent
status of *( and *u had early been questioned by Meillet (1964:118—122), who
regarded them as the syllabic forms of *y (*i) and *w (*M) respectively. Finally, a
strict adherence to Hirt's ablaut and accentuation theories made it possible to
eliminate apophonic *o, which was taken to result form an earlier *e when the
accent was shifted from the *e to another syllable (cf. Burrow 1973:112—113; Hirt
1921:173-179; Lehmann 1952:109-110). By applying all of these theories, it became
possible to reduce the Proto-Indo-European vowel system to a single member: *e.
It should be made clear that this extreme view was never universally accepted.
In fact, it was vigorously attacked by several scholars, including Roman Jakobson
(1971[1957]:528), who soberly noted: "The one-vowel picture of Proto-Indo-
European finds no '.support in the recorded languages of the world". See also
Trubetzkoy 1969:96.
In 1967, Szemerényi, relying heavily on typological data to support his
arguments, reinstated all of the vowels reconstructed by the Neogrammarians:
a e o i u d
à è ö î ü
Szemerényi (1967:97, fn. 91), however, ignores the diphthongs, "whose phonemic
status is disputed". I fully support Szemerényi's views on the vowels and would
reconstruct an identical system for the Proto-Indo-European antecedent of the
non-Anatolian daughter languages (cf. Bomhard 1979a:72).
Proto-Indo-European, as also, for example, Proto-Kartvelian, Northwest
Caucasian, and Proto-Semitic, was characterized by an interchange of vocalic
elements that could occur in any syllable. This interchange, which is commonly
called "ablaut" or "vowel gradation", was partially correlated with the position of the
accent and with distinctions between grammatical categories (cf. Burrow 1973:
2.5. The Proto-Indo-European Vowel System 75
108—117). Several gradation series are traditionally distinguished, and the general
scheme may be represented as follows (cf. Brugmann 1904:138—150; Hirt 1900 and
1921; Hübschmann 1885:71-180; Meillet 1964:153-168; Szemerényi 1990:86-97):
I. Short Vowel Gradation:
Lengthened-Grade Normal-Grade Reduced-Grade
A. è ~ ö e ~ 0 0
B. êi ~ öi e
i ~ °i i
ëu ~ óu eu u
ër ~ ör er ~ or r
ël ~ öl el ~ ol \
èm ~ öm em ~ om m
ën ~ ön en ~ on η
C. a ~ 0 0
D. ai i
au u
Long Vowel Gradation:
E. ë ~ ö 3
F. ó 3
G. ä ~ ö 3
The most common vowel was *e, and the most common gradation pattern was
the *e ~ *o contrast. The vowel *a was of relatively low statistical frequency and,
at least according to Meillet (1964:154), did not take part in the regular gradation
patterning. It should be pointed out, however, that several rare examples of an *a ~
*o contrast are attested in the non-Anatolian daughter languages, one probable
example being:
Greek άγω 'to lead, to carry, to convey, to bring'
ογμος 'any straight line: a furrow, path, etc.'
Colarusso (1981:499) has astutely observed: "... the PIE vowel system *e ~
*o is typologically utterly bizarre. Even adding *a to this system does not change
76 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
this fact". Perhaps the most typologically unusual thing about the Proto-
Indo-European vowel system as traditionally reconstructed is the great importance of
the *e ~ *o ablaut and the concomittant marginality of *a. Adding laryngeals only
makes the system even more unusual since *a then becomes mostly (but not in
every case!) a positional variant of *e. Rather, we would expect the relationship to
be reversed. All languages surveyed by Crothers (1978:93—152) have the vowel lai,
and this vowel is consistently characterized by a high frequency of occurrence (cf.,
for example, the frequency counts given in Greenberg 1966a:18—19). Moreover, in
the Kartvelian languages, Northwest Caucasian languages, and Semitic languages,
which also exhibit ablaut either as an active process or as a relic of an earlier, fully
functioning ablaut process, the vowel lai is an integral part of the ablaut system (cf.
Gamkrelidze 1966:80-81 for Kartvelian, Colarusso 1981:499-502 for Northwest
Caucasian, and Kurylowicz 1962 for Semitic). Clearly, if typological evidence is to
have any meaning, there is something wrong with the traditional reconstruction of
the Proto-Indo-European vowel system. Yet, if the Comparative Method is to have
any validity, there must be some truth to that reconstruction.
This seeming conflict can be resolved quite easily, I believe. We can consider
the traditional reconstruction to be mainly correct, but only for that form of
Proto-Indo-European spoken immediately prior to the emergence of the
non-Anatolian daughter languages, that is, what I call "Disintegrating Indo-
European". The vowel system of this form of Proto-Indo-European is by no means
ancient and is the end product of a long, complicated evolution.
The earliest Proto-Indo-European vowel system may have been as follows:
Also the sequences: iy ~ ey uy ~ oy ay ~ ay
iw ~ ew uw ~ ow aw ~ aw
I follow Pulleyblank (1965:86-101) in his reinterpretation of the *e ~ *o ablaut of
traditional Proto-Indo-European as a *3 ~ *a ablaut. Pulleyblank mentions that a
similar ablaut pattern exists in Kabardian. Colarusso (1981:499—501) proposes a
similar interpretation and also discusses possible typological parallels with the
Northwest Caucasian languages.
According to Hirt (1921:172-199) and those who follow his theories (Burrow,
Lehmann, and, formerly, the author, for example), the oldest ablaut alternation was
2.5. The Proto-Indo-European Vowel System 77
the full-grade ~ zero-grade contrast. This alternation is assumed to have arisen at a
time when the Proto-Indo-European phonological system was characterized by a
strong stress accent. This accent caused the weakening and loss of the vowels of
unstressed syllables. This period may be called the Phonemic Stress Stage of
Proto-Indo-European (cf. Lehmann 1952:111—112). At a later date, stress became
phonemically non-distinctive, and Proto-Indo-European was characterized by an
accent system based on pitch. This period may be called the Phonemic Pitch Stage
of Proto-Indo-European (cf. Lehmann 1952:109—110). It was supposedly during this
period that the *e ~ *o contrast came into being. *e is assumed to have been
changed to *o when the accent was shifted from the *e to another syllable. These
theories find support in the fact that the position of the accent is partially correlated
with ablaut patterning in both Greek and Old Indie. Counter-examples are usually
explained as due to analogical developments or as later forms that came into being
after the accent had lost its ability to influence the vowels (cf. Burrow 1973:112).
Though Kurylowicz originally adhered to Hirt's theories as well, he later
(1956:36—96 and 1964b:52) tried to show that the *e ~ *o contrast existed prior to
the development of the full-grade ~ zero-grade contrast. Kurylowicz argues that the
numerous counter-examples with accented *o indicate that qualitative ablaut was a
morphological device in its own right and only superficially connected with the
positioning of the accent. Moreover, he notes that, while vowel weakening and loss
are closely tied to the accent, a change in vowel quality is primarily due to the
environment — in other words, there is no cause-and-effect relationship between
qualitative ablaut and accentuation. These are convincing arguments and are the
primary basis for my belief that qualitative ablaut existed at the earliest
reconstructable period of Proto-Indo-European. Moreover, Kurylowicz's views find
support in the data from the other Nostratic languages (note here especially
Greenberg 1990a: 125: "...the Indo-European e:o (i.e. e:a) Ablaut is very old and is
part of a larger system of alternations which has correspondences in a number of
other branches of Eurasiatic").
The development of *3 into *e, which must have occurred fairly early since it
is already found in Hittite, is relatively easy to explain: *e was the normal
allophone of *3 under stress. John Colarusso (personal correspondence) has informed
me of a similar development in Ubykh and Circassian, where /a/ > [él
We may assume that *a had a rounded allophone in certain phonetic
environments (cf. Colarusso 1981:500), perhaps when next to labiovelars as well as
when next to *w. In late Disintegrating Indo-European, these allophones were
reapportioned, and apophonic *a was rephonemicized as *o. That this was an
extremely late development is shown (A) by the fact that it had not yet occurred in
the Anatolian languages and (B) by the widespread tendency of *a and *o to have
identical reflexes in several of the non-Anatolian daughter languages. No doubt, the
78 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
phonemicization of apophonic *o was facilitated by the presence of non-apophonic
*o in the system. This does not mean, however, that *a was totally eliminated. In
fact, the vowel *a must be reconstructed as an independent phoneme distinct from
*o for Disintegrating Indo-European (cf. Szemerényi 1964a:2—9 and 1967:83—84).
Disintegrating Indo-European *a had several sources: First, it arose from the
lowering and coloring of earlier *e (< *a) when next to α-coloring laryngeals. Next,
it was found in a small number of relic forms that somehow escaped conversion to
the regular *e ~ *o ablaut patterning. Finally, it was retained in loanwords from
other languages.
The origin of the Proto-Indo-European long vowels has always been
enigmatic. Many theories have been proposed, none of which has been completely
convincing. One thing seems certain, though: the long vowels developed over a
long period of time and had several causes.
The evidence for the existence of original long vowels is meager at best, and
there seems little reason to suppose that long vowels existed in pre-Proto-
Indo-European. Rather, long vowels may be assumed to have arisen solely in
Proto-Indo-European proper. First, long vowels arose from the contraction of two
short vowels. Though probably not frequent in the earlier stages of development,
contraction became increasingly important, especially in the later stages of the
Indo-European parent language and the early stages of the non-Anatolian daughter
languages, when the upheavals caused by the loss of whole classes of phonemes —
such as the laryngeals, for example — often brought two or more previously
separated vowels into contact. Long vowels also arose from the monophthongization
of diphthongs and from the lengthening of short vowels to compensate for the loss
of a following phoneme. The most significant cause of compensatory lengthening
was the loss of preconsonantal laryngeals after short vowels in Disintegrating
Indo-European. Finally, long vowels arose by means of the analogical process
known as "vrddhi" (cf. Burrow 1973:199-201; Kurylowicz 1968:298-307).
In reconstructing the Proto-Indo-European phonological system, the vowels *i
and *« are usually treated as allophones of *y (*i) and *w (*u) respectively and are
classed together with the résonants *m/*m, *n/*n, *//*/, *r/*r (cf. Lehmann
1952:10-14; Meillet 1964:105-126). However, as pointed out by Szemerényi
(1967:82), the patterning of these sounds is not entirely parallel. For the earliest
form of Proto-Indo-European, *i and *u should, in fact, be considered as
independent phonemic entities and should be classed with the vowels rather than
with the résonants. The glides *y and *w should also be considered as independent
phonemes during the early stages of development within Proto-Indo-European. At a
later date, however, after various sound changes had taken place, the patterning had
been modified in such a way that *i ~ *y and *u ~ *w were mostly in
complementary distribution. Cf. Schmitt-Brandt 1967:79—91; Gamkrelidze—Ivanov
2.5. The Proto-Indo-European Vowel System 79
1984.1:160-161. As further noted by Gamkrelidze-Ivanov (1984.1:164-165), the
changes alluded to above brought about a major restructuring of the functional role
of the high vowels *i and *u:
These phonetic and phonemic changes would have led to a split of the
consonants into consonants proper and résonants (/, u, r, I, m, n). The
résonants had syllabic and non-syllabic allophones depending on context, while
the consonants proper had only non-syllabic allophones (and the vowels were
exclusively syllabic in all positions). Consequently, résonants had the feature
value [tsyllabic], in contrast to consonants proper [-syllabic] and vowels
[+syllabicl.
These changes produced a major restructuring of the vowel system. The
original high vowels i and u became identified with the syllabic allophones of
i and u. Hence, they acquired the status of résonants, specifically, the syllabic
allophones of résonants. These vowels had not formerly been in alternation
with non-syllabic elements but were now pulled into the system of resonant
alternations, which severed their connection to the class of vowels.
This reanalysis of original i and u led, in some cases, to secondary
full-grade formations, with V being inserted into roots in which i or u had
originally been root vowels but which were now interpreted as zero-grade
résonants. This apparently took place in the parallel markers of the
Indo-European locative *-i/*-ei. Of the two locative forms, the stressed
*-i is clearly the older and reflects the ancient full-grade vowel *i: Gk. ποδ-ί,
Skt. pad-i 'in the foot', dat-i 'in the tooth', janas-i 'in birth', Hitt.
nepis-i 'in the sky', beside the later Slavic nebes-i 'in the sky'. Other
full-grade forms in which the diphthongs e i or eu correspond to i and u in
the zero-grade, often adduced as illustration of the full-grade ~ zero-grade
alternation, may well represent later formations from roots with original
vowels *i and *u which were secondarily identified with syllabic résonants and
reinterpreted as zero-grade.
According to the traditional reconstruction, Proto-Indo-European is assumed to
have had the following short diphthongs:
ai el o[ 3Í au eu ou du
In the reduced-grade, the semivowels alone appear:
i
u
80 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Szemerényi (1990:148) notes that, while this looks good on paper, it is difficult to
imagine the process that would have led to *i and *u in the reduced-grade. He
points out that it most certainly could not have been due to a simple loss of *e, *o,
and *a. The actual process leading to the appearance of *i and *u in the reduced-
grade was probably along the following lines: (A) after phonemicization of a strong
stress accent, stress-conditioned weakening of the vowel to *3 in unstressed syllables,
(B) assimilation of *3 to *i before *y and to *u before *w, (C) passage of *iy to *ï
and of *uw to *M, and (D) shortening of *i to *i and of *ü to *M, thus:

This is only part of the story, however, since it focuses primarily on the

In addition to the sequences of vowel plus *y and *w, the earliest form of
Proto-Indo-European also had sequences of *y and *w plus vowel. In unstressed
positions, the vowel was first reduced to *d. *3 was then assimilated to *i after *y,
and the preceding *y was lost, while after *w, it was assimilated to *u, and the
preceding *w was lost:
ydC > yiC > ÏC
wdC > wuC > üC
The picture is still not complete, though, for we must also consider how
laryngeals fit into the picture: The loss of laryngeals in sequences such as *eHiC,
*eHuC, and the like resulted in short diphthongs when accented (*eHiC > *eyC and
*eHuC > *ewC, etc.) — the preceding vowel was definitely not lengthened — but
long monophthongs when unaccented (*sHiC > *ayC > *iyC > *iC and *dHuC >
*9wC > *uwC > *mC, etc.). Since these changes were later than the changes
previously described and since stress was no longer phonemically distinctive, the
resulting long monophthongs were not shortened to *f and *ü respectively. In
sequences such as *eHax
C and the like, the loss of the intervocalic laryngeal first
produced a sequence of two short vowels. These vowels were then contracted to
form a long vowel (*eHa*C > *ea*C > *ëC, *oHa*C > *oa*C > *ÓC, *aHa*C >
*aax
C > *äC).
We may close this section by mentioning one last point. The numerous cases
of vrddhied stems in the non-Anatolian daughter languages — especially Old Indie —
appear to represent a contamination of types *CéC and *CöC with types *CeyV-/

*CoyV- and *CewV-/*CowV~, producing the new types *CéyV-/*CôyV- and
*CêwV-/*CôwV- (cf. Schmalstieg 1973b:108).
2.6. Accentuation and Ablaut in Proto-Indo-European
Disintegrating Indo-European was a "stress-accent" language (cf. Bubenik
1979:90-106; Halle-Kiparsky 1977:209-238 - for a good general discussion of stress
and "stress-accent" systems, cf. Hyman 1975:204—212, especially p. 207). Correlating
with the stress was changing pitch: rising from an unstressed syllable to a stressed
syllable and falling from a stressed syllable to an unstressed syllable. Every word,
except when used clitically, bore an accent. However, each word had only one
accented syllable. The position of an accent was morphologically conditioned,
accentuation being one of the means by which Proto-Indo-European distinguished
grammatical categories. Though originally not restricted to a particular syllable,
there was a tendency to level out the paradigm and fix the position of the accent on
the same syllable throughout. This tendency — the development of columnar
accentuation — began in Disintegrating Indo-European and continued into the
non-Anatolian daughter languages. Therefore, the Disintegrating Indo-European
system is only imperfectly preserved in even the most conservative of the daughter
languages, Vedic Sanskrit.
The rules governing the position of the accent in Disintegrating Indo-European
may be stated rather simply:
1. Neuter action nouns were accented on the stem in the so-called "strong"
cases but on the ending in the so-called "weak" cases (cf. Burrow
1973:220-226).
2. Common gender agent noun/adjectives were accented on the suffix
throughout the paradigm (cf. Burrow 1973:119).
3. Athematic verbs were accented on the stem in the singular but on the
ending in the plural (and dual) in the indicative but on the ending
throughout the middle (cf. Burrow 1973:303).
The thematic formations require special comment. It seems that thematic
agent noun/adjectives were originally accented on the ending in the strong cases and
on the stem in the weak cases. This pattern is the exact opposite of what is found
in the neuter action nouns. The original form of the nominative singular consisted
on the accented thematic vowel alone. It is this ending that is still found in the
84 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
vocative singular in the daughter languages and in relic forms such as the word for
the number 'five', *p[h
]enkw
[h]e (*penq<ie in traditional transcription). The
nominative singular in *-os is a later formation and is identical in origin with the
genitive singular (cf. Szemerényi 1972a:156).
The system of accentuation found in Disintegrating Indo-European was by no
means ancient. The earliest period of Proto-Indo-European proper that can be
reconstructed appears to have been characterized by a strong stress accent (cf.
Burrow 1973:108-112; Lehmann 1952:111-112, §15.4; 1993:131-132). This accent
caused the weakening and/or loss of the vowels of unaccented syllables. There was
a contrast between those syllables with stress and those syllables without stress.
Stress was used as an internal grammatical morpheme, the stressed syllable being the
morphologically distinctive syllable. The phonemicization of a strong stress accent
in early Proto-Indo-European caused a major restructuring of the inherited vowel
system and brought about the development of the syllabic nasals and liquids (cf.
Lehmann 1993:138).
In the latest period of Proto-Indo-European, quantitative ablaut was no longer
a productive process. Had there been a strong stress accent at this time, each
Proto-Indo-European word could have had only one syllable with full-grade vowel,
the vowels of the unstressed syllables having all been eliminated. However, since
the majority of reconstructed Proto-Indo-European words have more than one
full-grade vowel, the stress accent must have become non-distinctive at some point
prior to the latest stage of development.
To summarize: the earliest form of Proto-Indo-European was characterized by
a vowel system in which the normal-grade contrasted with either the reduced-grade
or the zero-grade (the choice between the reduced-grade on the one hand or the
zero-grade on the other depended upon the relationship of the unstressed syllable to
the stressed syllable — functionally, reduced-grade and zero-grade were equivalent).
The normal-grade was found in all strongly stressed, morphologically significant
syllables, while the reduced-grade or zero-grade was found in all syllables that
where morphologically non-distinctive and, therefore, unstressed. The lengthened-
grade was a later development and was functionally equivalent to the normal-grade.
As Proto-Indo-European began to build the morphological system of
grammatical categorization based upon the use of inflectional endings, it must often
have happened that more than one syllable of a word came to be considered
morphologically significant. For example, according to the rules of derivation and
inflection, the initial syllable of a word may have received the stress. At the same
time, an inflectional ending may have been added, and this ending, in order not to
be morphologically ambiguous, may also have had a full-grade vowel in addition to
the one found in the stressed syllable. By the same token, when the shift of accent
from, say, the stem to the ending would have produced unpronounceable consonant
2.7. Proto-Kartvelian (South Caucasian) 85
clusters, the vowel of the stem was retained.
It is probable that the Proto-Indo-European stress was pronounced with special
intonations that helped to make the accented syllable more discernable. When
words with more than one full-grade vowel came into being, stress ceased to be
phonemically distinctive. Phonemic pitch then replaced stress as the primary
suprasegmental indicator of morphologically distinctive syllables (cf. Burrow
1973:112-113; Lehmann 1952:109-110, §15.3; 1993:132 and 139), and the accent lost
its ability to weaken and/or eliminate the vowels of unaccented syllables. The
primary contrast was then between morphologically distinctive syllables with
full-grade vowel and high pitch and morphologically non-distinctive syllables with
full-grade vowel and low pitch.
Concurrent with the morphologically-conditioned development of the system
of vowel gradation, another method of indicating grammatical relationships was
developing, that being the use of inflectional endings. Gradually, the use of endings
became the primary means of grammatical categorization, with the result that vowel
gradation and accentuation became mostly unnecessary and redundant features. It
was not long before the earlier system of vowel gradation began to break down as
anological leveling took place. Also, in its later stages, Proto-Indo-European, as
well as the daughter languages, it may be noted, continued to create new formations,
that, unlike older formations, were not affected by the causes of vowel gradation.
Therefore, the patterns of vowel gradation are only imperfectly preserved in the
final stage of the Indo-European parent language and in the daughter languages.
2.7. Proto-Kartvelian (South Caucasian)
Proto-Kartvelian had a rich system of stops, affricates, and fricatives. Each
stop and affricate series was characterized by the three-way contrast (A) voiceless
(aspirated), (B) voiced, and (C) glottalized. Gamkrelidze—Macavariani (1982:18—19)
reconstruct three separate series of affricates and fricatives, namely, a front series
(*ts[h]t *ts\ *dz, *s, *z [traditional *c, *ç, *j, *s, *z]), a mid series (*ts

But Karl Horst Schmidt (1962:54—67) reconstructs only two series. It is the views of
Gamkrelidze and Macavariani that are followed in this book. We may note that
Klimov (1964) also reconstructs front, mid, and back affricates and fricatives for
Proto-Kartvelian.
The Proto-Kartvelian phonological system may be reconstructed as follows (cf.
Gamkrelidze 1966:70 and 1967:709):

The reconstruction of a voiced postvelar *G in Proto-Kartvelian is contested.
In Georgian, the glottalized postvelar was preserved, while the voiceless (aspirated)
and voiced postvelars merged with χ and y respectively:

2.8. The Proto-Kartvelian Vowel System 87
The Proto-Kartvelian résonants could function as syllables or non-syllabics
depending upon their environment. The patterning is strikingly similar to what is
assumed to have existed in Proto-Indo-European. According to Gamkrelidze
(1966:71-73 and 1967:709-711), the distributional patterning was as follows: The
résonants were syllabic (A) after a consonant and before pause, *C R#\ (B) in
stem-final position after a consonant, *~CR; (C) between consonants, *CRC; and (D)
after pause and before a consonant, *#RC. They were non-syllabic (A) after pause
and before a vowel, *#RV; (B) after a vowel and before pause, *VR#; (CO between a
vowel and a consonant, *VRC; and (D) between vowels, *VRV. However, when
found between a consonant and a vowel, *CRV, there appears to have been free
variation, at the Proto-Kartvelian level, between the syllabic and non-syllabic
allophones, *CRV ~ *CRV — Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan point to earlier syllabic
résonants, while Georgian points to earlier non-syllabic résonants. Finally, when two
résonants were in contact, one was syllabic and the other non-syllabic — the choice
of one or the other allophone appears to have been completely flexible, so that
*RRV, for example, could be realized as either *RRV or *RRV. Due to various
sound changes, the résonants no longer function as a separate class in any of the
Kartvelian daughter languages.
2.8. The Proto-Kartvelian Vowel System
Three short vowels and three long vowels are usually reconstructed for
Proto-Kartvelian: *e, *ê; *o, *ό; *a, *ä. These vowels were not evenly distributed
— the vowel *o in particular was of a fairly low statistical frequency of occurrence
in comparison with *e and *a. As in Proto-Indo-European, the vowels underwent
various ablaut changes. These vowel alternations served to indicate different types
of grammatical formations. The most common alternation was the interchange
between the vowels *e and *a in a given syllable. There was also ani alternation
among lengthened-grade vowels, normal-grade vowels, and reduced- and/or
zero-grade vowels. Reduced-grade was functionally a variant of zero-grade, while
lengthened-grade was functionally a variant of normal-grade. The lengthened-
grade, which was found mostly in the system of primary verbs and was a
fundamental morphological component of a group of verbal stems with thematic
aorist (cf. Gamkrelidze 1967:712), appears to have been a late creation (cf.
Gamkrelidze 1966:82). The basic rule was that no more than one morpheme could
have a full-grade vowel in a given polymorphemic form, the other morphemes in
the syntagmatic sequence being in either zero-grade or reduced-grade.
The vowel system of pre-Proto-Kartvelian may have been as follows:
88 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
i ~ e u ~ o
d ~ a
Also the sequences: iy ~ ey uy ~ oy 3y ~ ay
iw ~ ew uw ~ ow aw ~ aw
This is identical to the vowel system reconstructed for the earliest form of
Proto-Indo-European. As with Proto-Indo-European, I assume that the qualitative
alternations are very old and that they preceded the quantitative alternations.
Proto-Kartvelian proper began with the phonemicization of a strong stress
accent (cf. Gamkrelidze 1966:81, §3.4; Gamkrelidze—Macavariani 1965:370; Schmidt
1962:41). This accent caused the weakening and/or loss of the vowels of unaccented
syllables. There was a contrast between those syllables with stress and those
syllables without stress. As in Proto-Indo-European, stress positioning appears to
have functioned as a means of indicating different grammatical categories. The
phonemicization of a strong stress accent in early Proto-Kartvelian caused a
restructuring of the inherited vowel system and brought about the development of
the syllabic nasals and liquids and may also have ultimately been responsible for the
creation of the so-called "introvertive (decessive) harmonic consonant clusters".
When stressed, became *e, while, when unstressed, it became *i. The
vowels *o and *a remained unchanged when stressed, but became *0 when
unstressed.
Though Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Kartvelian may be assumed to have
undergone similar developments in their early prehistory, the resulting systems were
not identical (cf. Harris 1990:90—92). For example, Proto-Kartvelian did not
rephonemicize apophonic *a and *o as did Proto-Indo-European, while, in the
reduced-grade, *e was realized as *i in Proto-Kartvelian and not as *3 (traditional
"schwa secundum"), which appears to have been the regular development in Proto-
Indo-European. Moreover, though a rule similar to that found in Proto-Kartvelian
prohibiting more than one full-grade vowel in any given polymorphemic form must
have also characterized an early stage of Proto-Indo-European, in its later stages of
development, this rule was no longer operative.
2.9. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Kartvelian
Comparison of Proto-Kartvelian with the other Nostratic languages, especially
2.9. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Kartvelian 89
Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Afroasiatic, makes it seem probable that the root
structure patterning developed as follows:
1. There were no initial vowels in the earliest form of pre-Proto-
Kartvelian. Therefore, every root began with a consonant. (At a later
stage of development, however, loss of laryngeals resulted in roots with
initial vowels: *HVC- > *VC~. Similar developments occurred in later
Proto-Indo-European.)
2. Though originally not permitted, later changes led to the development of
initial consonant clusters.
3. Two basic syllable types existed: (A) open syllables (*V arid *CV) and
(B) closed syllables (*VC and *CVC). Permissible root forms coincided
exactly with these two syllable types. Loss of laryngeals in early Proto-
Kartvelian also led to roots in the form *C~.
4. A verbal stem could either be identical with a root or it could consist of
a root plus a single derivational morpheme added as a suffix to the root:
*CVC~VC~. Any consonant could serve as a suffix. (Inflectional
endings could be of the form *-V as in the case of the 3rd singular
aorist ending *-a.)
5. Similar patterns occurred in nominal stems.
At this time, there were three fundamental stem types: (A) verbal stems, (B)
nominal and adjectival stems, and (C) pronominal and indeclinable stems. That this
distinction remained in Proto-Kartvelian proper is shown by the fact that prefixes
mostly maintained their original structural identity, being only partially involved in
the system of vowel gradation (cf. Gamkrelidze 1967:715) as well as by the fact that
nominal stems were sharply distinguished from verbal stems in that they had the
same ablaut state throughout the paradigm, while extended (that is, bimorphemic)
verbal stems had alternating ablaut states according to the paradigmantic pattern (cf.
Gamkrelidze 1967:714-715).
The phonemicization of a strong stress accent disrupted the patterning outlined
above. The positioning of the stress was morphologically distinctive, serving as a
means to differentiate grammatical categories. All vowels were relained when
stressed but were either weakened (= "reduced-grade") or totally eliminated (=
"zero-grade") when unstressed: the choice between the reduced-grade versus the
zero-grade depended upon the position of the unstressed syllable relative to the
90 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
stressed syllable as well as upon the laws of syllabicity in effect at that time.
Finally, it was at this stage of development that the syllabic allophones of the
résonants came into being and possibly the introvertive harmonic consonant clusters
as well.
The stress-conditioned ablaut alternations gave rise to two distinct forms of
extended stems:
State 1: Root in full-grade and accented, suffix in zero-grade: *CVCC~.
State 2: Root in zero-grade, suffix in full-grade and accented: *CCVC~.
These alternating patterns, which characterize the bimorphemic verbal stems, may be
illustrated by the following examples (these are taken from Gamkrelidze 1966:74 and
1967:714):
State 1 State 2
Intransitive Transitive
*der-k'- 'to bend, to stoop' *dr-ek'~ 'to bend'
*ser-t'~ 'to go out' *sr-et'~ 'to extinguish'
*k'er-b- 'to gather' *k'r-eb- 'to collect'
When a full-grade suffix was added to such stems, the preceding full-grade vowel
was replaced by either reduced-grade or zero-grade:
State 1 State 2
*der-k'~ > *dr-k'-a *dr-ek'~ > *dr-ik'-e
*ser-t'~ > *sr-t'~a *sr-et'~ > *sr-it'-e
*k'er-b- > *k'r-b-a *k'r-eb- > *k'r-ib-e
Nominal stems also displayed these patterns, though, unlike the bimorphemic verbal
stems, the same ablaut state was fixed throughout the paradigm (these examples are
from Gamkrelidze 1967:714):
State 1 State 2
*s¡ax-l- 'house' *klh
]m-ar- 'husband'
*dz¡ay-l- 'dog' *ts[h]m-el- 'fat'
*k'wen-r- 'marten' *d2
,m-ar- 'vinegar'
2.10. The Proto-Afroasiatic Consonant System 91
2.10. The Proto-Afroasiatic Consonant System
Unlike the comparative-historical study of the Indo-European Language
Family, which has a long history, the comparative-historical study of the Afroasiatic
Language Family is still not far advanced. Even though the Semitic and Egyptian
branches have been scientifically investigated rather thoroughly, several of the other
branches are only now being examined, and there remain many modern Afroasiatic
languages that are scarcely even known. Moreover, while a few of the daughter
languages have written records going back many millennia, most of the daughter
languages are only known from recent times. Given this state of affairs, it is not
yet possible to reconstruct the Proto-Afroasiatic phonological system with absolute
certainty in all areas, though some preliminary conclusions are possible. A
comparison of the most ancient Afroasiatic daughter languages indicates that the
phonological system of the Afroasiatic parent language contained at least the
following sounds (cf. Diakonoff—Militarëv—Porkhomovsky—Stolbova 1987:9—29,
especially p. 12; D. Cohen 1968:1300-1306; Diakonoff 1988:34-41 and 1992:5-35):

92 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Vowels:
Other sounds have also been posited for Proto-Afroasiatic by several scholars —
these include prenasalized labials (cf. Greenberg 1958:295-302 and 1965:88-92),
postvelars stops, affricates, and/or fricatives (cf. Diakonoff 1974:595; 1988:34 and 39),
and additional sibilants (cf. Diakonoff 1965:21). Though it is by means impossible
that some of these sounds may have belonged to the Proto-Afroasiatic phonological
system, in my opinion, the arguments advanced so far to support their reconstruction
are not convincing.
In the Semitic branch, the so-called "emphatics" have three different
realizations: (A) in Arabic, the emphatics have been described as either uvularized
(cf. Catford 1977:193) or pharyngealized consonants (cf. Al-Ani 1970:44-58; Catford
1977:193; Chomsky-Halle 1968:306); (B) in the Modern South Arabian languages (cf.
Johnstone 1975:6—7, §2.1.2), the Semitic languages of Ethiopia (cf. Moscati 1964:
23—24, §8.2), and several Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects (such as, for example,
Urmian Nestorian Neo-Aramaic and Kurdistani Jewish Neo-Aramaic), the emphatics
are glottalized — the glottalization is weak in Urmian Nestorian Neo-Aramaic; and
(C) in several other Neo-Aramaic dialects (such as, for example, Tür-'Abdin), the
emphatics are realized as unaspirated voiceless stops (cf. Dolgopolsky 1977:1) — here,
the non-emphatic voiceless stops are distinguished from the emphatics by the
presence of the feature of aspiration.
Circumstantial evidence indicates that the emphatics may also have been
glottalized in Akkadian, Ancient Hebrew, and the oldest Aramaic: (A) In Akkadian,
when two emphatics cooccurred in a root, one of them was changed into the
corresponding non-emphatic (Geers' Law), thus: t ~ k/s > t ~ k/s; k ~ s > k ~ s;
k ~ t > k ~ t (cf. Ungnad—Matous 1969:27). Now, in languages having ejectives,
there is a widespread constraint against the cooccurrence of two ejectives in a root
(cf. Hopper 1973:160—161). If we take the emphatics of Akkadian to have been
ejectives, then Geers' Law finds a perfectly natural explanation as a manifestation of
this constraint. (B) Pharyngealization is not incompatible with voicing, but
glottalization is (cf. Greenberg 1970:125—127, §2.2). Thus, Arabic has voiced as well
as voiceless emphatics (cf. Al-Ani 1970:44—58; Ambros 1977:8—10 and 13—14). In
Hebrew and Aramaic, however, the emphatics are never voiced (cf. Cantineau
1952:93; Moscati 1964:23—24), and the same is most likely true for Akkadian and
Ugaritic as well. (C) Pharyngealization is always accompanied by the backing of
contiguous vowels (cf. Hyman 1975:49; Ladefoged 1971:63—64). Similar backing is
2.10. The Proto-Afroasiatic Consonant System 93
sometimes also found in conjunction with glottalization. Indeed, in all of the
modern Neo-Aramaic dialects mentioned above, vowels are always backed when
next to emphatic consonants regardless of how the emphatics are realized. However,
while backing of adjacent vowels is a mandatory corollary of pharyngealization, it is
optional with glottalization. Therefore, since the emphatics of Arabic are
pharyngealized, contiguous vowels are always backed (cf. Al-Ani 1970:23—24;
Cantineau 1952:92; Martinet 1975[1959]:237). No such backing is observable in
either Akkadian or Hebrew (cf. Cantineau 1952:93; Martinet 1975[1959]:237—238;
Moscati 1964:23-24).
Both Greenberg (1970:127) and Martinet (1975[1953]:251) have pointed out that
it is common for languages having ejectives to lack the bilabial member (cf. also
Gamkrelidze 1978:17 and 1981:587-589). Now, it is extremely unlikely that
Proto-Semitic possessed a bilabial emphatic (cf. Cantineau 1952:80—81; Moscati
1964:25). A gap at this point of articulation would be easy to understand if the
emphatics had been ejectives in Proto-Semitic. Though an emphatic bilabial must be
reconstructed at the Proto-Afroasiatic level, it was extremely rare. Such a low
frequency of occurrence agrees fully with the distributional patterning of bilabial
ejectives in attested languages having such sounds.
The cumulative evidence leaves little doubt that the emphatics were globalized
(ejectives) in Proto-Semitic and not pharyngealized as in Arabic. This conclusion is
also reached by Bergsträsser (1928:5 and 1983:4), Cantineau (1952:91-94), Martinet
(1975[1959]:238 and 1975[ 19531:250—252), and Steiner (1977:155), to name a few.
According to Dolgopolsky (1977:1—13), the pharyngealized emphatics of Arabic can
be derived from earlier ejectives through the following steps:
A. The earliest Arabic inherited the triple contrast voiceless aspirated ~
voiced ~ globalized from Proto-Semitic.
B. First, vowels were backed when next to emphatic consonants.
C. Next, the glottalization was weakened and eventually lost. Non-
emphatic voiceless consonants were then distinguished from emphatics by
the presence of the feature of aspiration. Furthermore, vowels were
backed when next to emphatics but not when next to non-emphatics.
(This is the stage of development reached by the Neo-Aramaic dialect of
Tür-'Abdin.)
D. Finally, aspiration was lost, and the emphatics were distinguished from
the non-emphatic voiceless consonants solely by backing (that is,
pharyngealization).
94 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
The evidence from the other branches of Afroasiatic supports the contention
that the emphatics were ejectives not only in Proto-Semitic but in Proto-Afroasiatic
as well.
The emphatics were lost as a separate series in Ancient Egyptian (cf. Vergote
1971:43). The velar emphatic *k' became the voiceless postvelar stop q, while the
remaining emphatics merged with the voiceless unaspirated consonants. The
developments probably went as follows:
A. The earliest Egyptian inherited the triple contrast voiceless aspirated ~
voiced ~ glottalized from Proto-Afroasiatic.
Β First, the voiced consonants became unvoiced. The resulting system had
the contrast voiceless aspirated ~ voiceless unaspirated ~ glottalized.
C. Next, the emphatics other than *k' became deglottalized and merged
with the voiceless unaspirated stops. It is not difficult to understand why
*k' would have remained longer than the other emphatics since back
articulation is the unmarked point of articulation for ejectives (cf.
Greenberg 1970:127-129, §2.3).
D. Finally, *k' become q. (We may note that a similar development is
found in several East Cushitic languages, Somali being one example.)
In the modern Berber languages, the emphatics are pharyngealized as in Arabic
(cf. D. Cohen 1968:1302; Penchoen 1973:7, §2.3.1 [a]). Both voiced and voiceless
emphatics exist. We may assume that the pharyngealized emphatics found in the
Berber languages are due to secondary developments. No doubt, the emphatics
developed in Berber in much the same way as they did in Arabic.
Of the modern Chadic languages, Angas, Dangaleat, Ga'anda, Higi, Margi,
Tera, and Sayanci, for instance, have implosives, while Hausa has implosives in the
bilabial and dental series but ejectives in the sibilant and velar series corresponding
to the Semitic emphatics (cf. D. Cohen 1968:1302). According to Newman (1977:9,
§2.1), a series of implosives is to be reconstructed here for Proto-Chadic.
Jungraithmayr—Shimizu (1981:19—20), however, reconstruct a system for Proto-
Chadic similar to what is found in Hausa, with bilabial and dental implosives and
sibilant and velar ejectives. Martinet (1970:113, §4.28) notes that ejectives can
develop into implosives through a process of anticipation of the voice of a following
vowel, thus:
2.10. The Proto-Afroasiatic Consonant System 95
p' t' k' > 6 cC cr
If we follow Martinet, as I think we must, the implosives reconstructed for
Proto-Chadic by Newman are to be derived from earlier ejectives.
The Cushitic and Omotic languages provide the strongest evidence in favor of
interpreting the emphatics of Proto-Afroasiatic as ejectives. The Cushitic languages
Awngi and Galab possess neither implosives nor ejectives and can, therefore, be left
out of consideration since they do not represent the original state of affairs. Of the
remaining Cushitic languages, Beja (also called Bedawye) has only the retroflex
implosive l<fl·, Oromo (formerly called Galla) has the retroflex implosive I d I plus
the ejectives lp', t', t's
\ k'l·, Bilin has the ejectives It', t~s
', k'l·, Somali has the
retroflex dental Idi (from earlier */cf/) and the voiceless postvelar q (from earlier
*k')\ and Iraqw has the affricate ejective lts
'l and the voiceless postvelars q and
qw (from earlier *k' and *k'w
respectively) (plus, marginally, ΙδΙ and hfl). Of the
modern Omotic languages, Kefa (South Gonga) has the ejectives lp', t', c', k'l, Dizi
has the ejectives It', ts
', c', k'l, Walamo has the ejectives lp', t', ts
', c', k\ s'l, while
Hamer has only the uvular ejective Iq'l. (The data on Kefa, Dizi, and Hamer are
from Bender 1976.) These clearly correspond to the Semitic emphatics.
The correspondences between the Semitic daughter languages are completely
straightforward for the bilabial, dental, and velar stops, and, therefore, there can be
no question that *p, *b\ *t, *d, *t'; *k, *g, *k' should be reconstructed for
Proto-Semitic. It should be noted that the voiceless stops were probably voiceless
aspirates (that is, *lph
l, *lth
l, *lkh
l) in Proto-Semitic (cf. Cantineau 1952:90-91;
Martinet 1975[1953]:250) as well as in Proto-Afroasiatic (cf. D. Cohen 1968:1303).
The aspiration was phonemically non-distinctive.
Diakonoff (1965:20) reconstructs an emphatic bilabial, which he writes *p, for
Proto-Semitic. However, as he himself admits, the evidence for this sound is
extremely weak. It is best to agree with Cantineau (1952:80—81) and Moscati
(1964:25, §8.7) that an emphatic bilabial should not be reconstructed for Proto-
Semitic. There is some evidence, however, to support reconstructing a glottalized
bilabial stop for Proto-Afroasiatic. This sound was characterized by an extremely
low frequency of occurrence.
In Hebrew and Aramaic, Ipl, Ibi, Iti, Idi, Ikl, Igl have the non-phonemic
allophones ΙφΙ, IUI, ΙΘΙ, Idi, ΙχΙ, ΙγΙ respectively (cf. Moscati 1964:26-27, §8.10).
In Arabic, Epigraphic South Arabian, the modern South Arabian languages,
and Geez (also referred to as Ethiopie), Proto-Semitic *p[h
l has become f (cf.
Moscati 1964:24—25, §8.6). Proto-Semitic *g has become g in Classical Arabic (cf.
Moscati 1964:38, §8.42), though it is retained unchanged in some dialects (cf.
96 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Martinet 1975Í19591:243-245).
The data from the non-Semitic Afroasiatic branches are also fairly
straightforward and fully support reconstructing the bilabials *p[h
] and *b, the
dentals *tfh
J, *d, and *t', and the velars *kth
], *g, and *k' for Proto-Afroasiatic.
According to Greenberg (1958:295-302 and 1965:88-92), two additional labials
should be reconstructed for Proto-Afroasiatic: *f and *m
b. While he has made a
strong case for *f separate from *p[h ], his theories concerning *m
b are not
convincing and have been successfully argued against by Illic-Svityc (1966:9—34) —
Illic-Svytic considers *m
b to contain a prefix *m~.
Secondary palatalization of the dentals before front vowels is a widespread
occurrence, being especially common in the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and in
Chadic. Both secondary palatalization as well as a tendency toward fricativization
are widespread developments in the velar series in the Afroasiatic daughter languages.
In certain cases, gutturals in the Cushitic branch correspond to sibilants in the
Semitic languages and to affricates in Egyptian (cf. Vergote 1971:44). These
examples can be accounted for by reconstructing a series of palatalized velars for
Proto-Afroasiatic: *ky[h
], *gy, and *k'y. In Proto-Semitic, this series first
developed into the dental affricates *ts
Ih
1, *dz
, and *ts
' respectively. These
newly-formed dental affricates then merged completely with the previously-existing
dental affricates, and the subsequent development of these two series was identical.
In Egyptian, on the other hand, the palatalized velars merged with the palatalized
alveolare. Finally, in Cushitic, the palatalized velars merged with the plain velars.
In addition to the correspondences that make it seem highly probable that
Proto-Afroasiatic had both plain and palatalized velars, there are still other
correspondences that point to the existence of a series of labiovelars in Proto-
Afroasiatic (cf. D. Cohen 1968:1303; M. Cohen 1947:129-130): *kw
[h], *g">, and
*k'w
. Although the labiovelars were lost in Semitic (as well as in Egyptian and
Berber), having merged with the plain velars, their former presence can be
ascertained by the fact that, in primary nominal stems, they, along with the labials,
caused a following earlier to be raised, backed, and rounded to *u (cf. Diakonoff
1970:456 and 465; 1975:135 and 141): *k»>[h]9, *g*3, *k'*>3 > *k[h]u, *gu, *k'u.
The labiovelars were preserved in Proto-Southern Cushitic (cf. Ehret 1980:23—36)
and Proto-Chadic (Newman 1970:11).
The following correspondences serve as the basis for the reconstruction of
bilabials, dentals, plain velars, palatalized velars, and labiovelars for Proto-
Afroasiatic (for supporting Semitic examples, cf. D. Cohen 1970- ) and the standard
handbooks, especially Bergsträsser (1928 and 1983) and Gray (1934), though the
Proto-Semitic reconstructions proposed by Gray are often questionable; for
supporting examples from all branches of Afroasiatic, cf. Bomhard 1984:133—174,

Notes on Egyptian:
98 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
A. Ancient Egyptian is given in traditional transcription. It should be noted,
however, that the phonemes traditionally transcribed as b, d, d, g,
q were probably the voiceless unaspirated consonants lp, t, t's
, k, q!
respectively, while the phonemes transcribed as p, t, L, k were probably
the voiceless aspirated consonants Iph, th
, t'sh
, kh
l respectively (cf.
Callender 1975:7-8, §2.1; Vergole 1971:43).
Β. In Egyptian, k and g became t_ and (L respectively before Iii and lui (cf.
Diakonoff 1965,28, note 11).
A series of dental affricates must be reconstructed for Proto-Afroasiatic. At
first glance, the Semitic correspondences would seem to indicate that a series of
sibilants should be reconstructed here for Proto-Semitic, and, as a matter of fact,
sibilants are posited in the standard handbooks (cf. Bergsträsser 1928:4 and 1983:3;
Brockelmann 1908.1:128-136; Gray 1934:8; Moscati 1964:33-37; O'Leary 1923:53-62;
Wright 1890:57—64). There is some evidence from within Semitic itself, however,
that this series was originally composed of dental affricates (cf. M. Cohen 1947:141,
143, and 145; Diakonoff 1965:20-21, 1974:595, and, especially, 1992:36-55; Faber
1981:233-262; Martinet 1975[ 19533:253—254; Steiner 1982): *t*lh
7, *dz
, and *t"'.
This does not mean that the independent existence of sibilants in the Semitic parent
language is to be excluded. On the contrary, in addition to the dental affricates,
Proto-Semitic must also have had, at the very least, the sibilants *s and *s.
The primary evidence for earlier dental affricates comes from Hebrew and
Akkadian (cf. Diakonoff 1965:20—21). First, the emphatic sibilant Isl is traditionally
pronounced as a dental affricate in Hebrew, and, as noted by Cantineau (1952:83),
this pronunciation is not a recent nor secondary development. Next, it is now
known that the Hittite cuneiform syllabary was borrowed at the beginning of the
second millennium BCE directly from that form of Old Akkadian then written in
Northern Syria (cf. Gamkrelidze 1968:91—92) and not from Hurrian as previously
thought (cf. Sturtevant 1951:2-3, §5). The Hittite syllabary contains signs that are
transliterated with a ζ but which, in actuality, represent the dental affricate lts
l (cf.
Sturtevant 1951:14—15, §25). This seems to indicate that the <z> of Old Akkadian
was pronounced as an affricate (cf. Martinet 1975[19533:254). Also worth noting is
the fact that Hittite employed the cuneiform signs containing <s> to represent Isl (cf.
Sturtevant 1951:25, §50). Since the Akkadian cuneiform syllabary contained signs
traditionally transliterated as s in addition to those transliterated as s, we must
conclude that the Hittites chose the latter signs because they were closer to their
sibilant than the former. We may venture a guess that the Hittites chose the s-signs
because the i-signs represented affricates in Akkadian at the time when they
adopted the cuneiform writing system. This conclusion is supported by the Hurrian
evidence, where, according to Diakonoff (1965:21), the cuneiform signs with <z> and
2.10. The Proto-Afroasiatic Consonant System 99
<s> are used to denote affricates (see also Diakonoff—Starostin 1986:13—15 for a
discussion of Hurrian phonology and 1986:11—13 for a discussion of the phonology
of the closely-related Urartean).
Additional evidence for affricate pronunciation comes from Egyptian material
dating from the second millennium BCE. In transcribing Semitic words and names,
Egyptian fairly consistently uses L for (traditional) s in the Semitic words and d for
(traditional) ζ and s in the Semitic words (cf. Diakonoff 1988:36; for examples, cf.
Albright 1934:33-67).
Finally, Cantineau (1952:83) and M. Cohen (1947:145) briefly mention the fact
that Proto-Semitic *ts
' (traditional *s) is mostly pronounced as either an affricate or
a dental stop in the Semitic languages of Ethiopia.
In the other branches of Afroasiatic, sibilants, affricates, and dentals correspond
to Proto-Semitic *tHh
l, *dz, and *fi
' (cf. M. Cohen 1947:141-147; Diakonoff
1965:26). The developments found in all branches of Afroasiatic can best be
accounted for by reconstructing a series of dental affricates for Proto-Afroasiatic (cf.
D. Cohen 1968:1304; Diakonoff 1988:36-39). It may be noted that this series is well
preserved in Southern Cushitic and that it has even endured to the present day in
Dahalo (cf. Ehret 1980:33). Finally, it should be mentioned here that affricates have
also arisen through secondary developments in all branches of Afroasiatic.

Opinions differ as to whether a series of palato-alveolar affricates (that is,
*d~z, and *t~s
') or palatalized alveolare (that is, *ty[h
], *dy, and *t'y) are to be
posited for Proto-Afroasiatic. Diakonoff (1988:34 and 36—39) favors palato-alveolar
affricates, which he writes *c, *c, while D. Cohen (1968:1304) favors palatalized
alveolare:
100 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
There is a problem with the series generally defined, based upon [the evidence
of] Arabic, as consisting of interdentals. But, outside of Common Arabic,
these sounds are represented, depending upon the language, sometimes as
palato-alveolar fricatives, sometimes as sibilants, and sometimes as plain dental
stops. Such correspondences can only be explained clearly if the series in
question is considered to have been in Proto-Afroasiatic, as well as in
Proto-Semitic, made up of palatals.
Moscati (1964:27-30) reconstructs interdentals (IPA [Θ], [ö], and [Θ']) for
Proto-Semitic on the basis of the Arabic reflexes, and this is the reconstruction
found in all of the standard handbooks. Cantineau (1952:81—82), however,
reconstructs earlier (palato-)alveolars (apicales «à pointe basse»). He notes:
But it is difficult to determine whether it is a question at the Semitic level of
true fricatives or of affricates...
Finally, Martinet (1975[19531:257-258) posits palatals, which he writes *t\ *d, *t'.
Martinet's reconstructions, which have as their basis not only the data from the
Semitic daughter languages but also Martinet's extensive knowledge of phonology in
general and of the way phonemes develop over time in particular, this knowledge
being derived from the study of a wide variety of languages from different language
families, surely come the closest to the truth: the developments found in the Semitic
daughter languages can best be explained by reconstructing a series of palatalized
alveolar stops for Proto-Semitic: *ty[h
], *dy, and *t'y.
The oldest Akkadian may have preserved this series. According to Gelb
(1961:35-39), Old Akkadian s3 corresponds to Hebrew s and Arabic ¿.(from
Proto-Semitic *ty[h
], traditional *t), while s4 may correspond to Hebrew ζ and
Arabic d (from Proto-Semitic *dy, traditional *d)· S3 and s4 are distinct from s¡
and s2, which represent Proto-Semitic *s and *t¡
[h
] (traditional *s [Diakonoff
1988:34 writes *i]) respectively (cf. Gelb 1961:35). Cf. here also Diakonoff 1965:21,
note 25, and 1992:36-55.
In the other branches of Afroasiatic, palato-alveolar affricates, dentals, and
palatalized alveolar stops correspond to Proto-Semitic *tyfh
], *dy, and *t'y. The
correspondences from all branches of Afroasiatic can more effectively be explained
by setting up a series of palatalized alveolar stops for the Proto-Afroasiatic parent
language than by setting up a series of palato-alveolar affricates — note that, in
addition to Proto-Semitic, such a reconstruction is strongly supported by Proto-
Southern Cushitic.

The Semitic sibilants have been the subject of much controversy (cf. especially
Beeston 1962:222-231; Faber 1981:233-262; Murtonen 1966:135-150). Though there
are many points of agreement among Semiticists, there is still no consensus on the
number of sibilants to be reconstructed for Proto-Semitic. The sibilants remain one
of the most perplexing problems in both Semitic and Afroasiatic comparative
phonology.
According to the traditional reconstruction, Proto-Semitic is assumed to have
had the following sibilants (cf. Moscati 1964:33—37): *s, *z, *s, *s, and *s, to which
Diakonoff (1965:21) adds *i. Now, as noted above in the discussion of the dental
affricates, it seems fairly certain that the traditional *s is to be partially, and *z and
*s are to be totally reinterpreted as the dental affricates *ts
ih
], *dz
, and *ts
'
respectively at the Proto-Semitic level. Next, following Martinet (1975[1953]:253),
*'s is to be reinterpreted as a voiceless lateralized affricate **tl
[h
l (see also Steiner
1977, though Steiner prefers a fricative lateral *i over an affricate). Finally,
Diakonoffs proposed *£_ has received little support from fellow Semiticists. Thus, it
seems likely that, of the traditional sibilants, only and *s can have any claim to
being original.
Certain correspondences between Semitic and the other branches of Afroasiatic
seem to indicate that the sibilants *s and *sy are to be reconstructed for Proto-
Afroasiatic. There are other correspondences, however, which simply do not fit the
expected patterns. However, there is no justification for positing additional sibilants
beside *s and *sy. In his most recent survey of Afroasiatic (= his "Afrasian"),
Diakonoff (1988:34) also sets up only two sibilants, which he writes *s and *s, for
Proto-Afroasiatic (not including his *s, which is a fricative lateral).

The Modern South Arabian languages contain the fricative laterals s and z,
that is, /#/ and /£/ respectively (cf. Johnstone 1975:7, §2.1.3; Steiner 1977:20). The
voiceless fricative lateral s corresponds to sibilants in the other Semitic languages,
thus (excluding Hebrew, for the moment): Mehri, Jibbäli (formerly called Sheri),
Harsüsi, Soqotri s, Epigraphic South Arabian s2 (s) = Akkadian s, Ugaritic i,
Aramaic s, Arabic s, Geez (Classical Ethiopie) s. In Hebrew, however, a special
character, adapted from sin and transliterated as s, appears in words whose cognates
in the South Arabian languages contain fricative laterals (cf. Moscati 1964:33—34,
§8.29). The evidence of Hebrew, coupled with that of the South Arabian languages,
makes it seem likely that Proto-Semitic contained the voiceless lateralized affricate
*t'[h] (cf. Martinet 1975[1953]:253). Cantineau (1952:84-87) and Steiner (1977:
155—156), however, would rather posit a voiceless fricative lateral H for Proto-
Semitic. I prefer lateralized affricates to fricative laterals because the former
provide a better basis for comparison with the cognate Afroasiatic languages.
The original pronunciation of the Arabic sound transliterated as d can be
determined by the testimony of the native grammarians (cf. Cantineau 1952:84;
Steiner 1977:57—67) and from the evidence of loan-words in other languages (cf.
Steiner 1977:68—91). In all probability, this sound was originally a voiced emphatic
fricative lateral (cf. Cantineau 1952:84; Steiner 1977:64—65). This sound can be
derived from either an earlier globalized lateralized affricate *t1
' (cf. Cantineau
1952:84-86, who writes *t'2; D. Cohen 1968:1304-1305, who writes *tl'; Martinet
1975[1953]:253, who writes *tl') or an earlier glottalized fricative lateral *#' (cf.
Steiner 1977:155—156). Either reconstruction can also account for the developments
found in the other Semitic daughter languages. In Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Hebrew,
Proto-Semitic *t1
' has the same reflex as *ts
', namely s. As for the Modern South
Arabian languages, it is represented by a lateralized dental emphatic in Soqotri,
while in Mehri, Harsüsi, and Jibbäli, it is represented by a lateralized interdental
fricative emphatic (transcribed d)· In Geez, its reflex is generally transcribed as d,
though the traditional pronunciation is identical to that of s (cf. Lambdin 1978:4).
2.10. The Proto-Afroasiatic Consonant System 103
The Aramaic developments are problematic: in the most ancient texts, Proto-
Semitic *t1
' is represented by q, while, in later texts, it is represented by r
. For
discussion of this problem and proposed solutions, cf. Cantineau (1952:86) and
Steiner (1977:38-41).
According to D. Cohen (1968:1304—1305), voiceless and globalized lateralized
affricates should also be reconstructed for Proto-Afroasiatic.

For the most part, the nasals, liquids, and glides are well preserved in the
Semitic daughter languages, and there can be no question that Proto-Semitic had *m,
*n, */, *r, *w, and *y. Only the glides undergo any modifications worth
mentioning, though it may be noted in passing that η becomes m in mimation in
Akkadian, Hebrew, and Epigraphic South Arabian (cf. Diakonoff 1965:28, note 2,
and 61—62; Moscati 1964:96-100).
In later Akkadian, the glides were lost initially (cf. Moscati 1964:45—46, §8.63;
O'Leary 1923:66—67), while in Ugaritic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, initial *w mostly
became y (cf. Gray 1934:18, §27; Moscati 1964:46, §8.64; O'Leary 1923:65-67) -
such a development also occurs sporadically in ancient South Arabian dialects.
The nasals *m and *n, the liquids */ and *r, and the glides *w and *y are also
to be reconstructed for Proto-Afroasiatic.
Ancient Egyptian did not have separate signs for III. It is certain, however,
that III existed as an independent phonemic entity since it occurs as such in the later
Coptic. In Egyptian, III was written with the signs <n>, <r>, <i>, and <:¡> (< *li-,
*lu- [cf. Diakonoff 1974:494]). *-r became <?> in Egyptian when it occurred at the
end of an accented syllable before a following consonant or before pause. Similar
developments can be observed for t, d, and n, by the way. In some instances,
y represents either an earlier glottal stop or an earlier w.

Even though Proto-Semitic is usually assumed to have had *?, *h, *h, *x,
and *y (traditionally written *', *h, *h, *', *h, and *g respectively), it is doubtful
that Proto-Afroasiatic had *x and *y (cf. D. Cohen 1968:1306). Comparison with
the cognate Afroasiatic languages indicates that Proto-Semitic *x and *y are to be
derived from earlier *H and *f respectively. The developments may have been as
follows: *h > *xa
(voiceless pharyngealized velar fricative) > *x (cf. Colarusso
1981:545—546 for a discussion of typological parallels with developments in the
Northwest Caucasian languages) and *î > *ya
(voiced pharyngealized velar fricative)
> *y. In Akkadian, *?, *h, *h, *?, and *y (but not *x [traditional */?]) merged into
9
I?I initially. The former presence of *h and *f and sometimes of *y and *h as
well can be determined by the fact that they changed a contiguous a to e (cf.
Moscati 1964:38—39, §8.45, and 41-42, §8.54). These same sounds were completely
lost medially between a preceding vowel and a following non-syllabic. This change
caused the vowel to be lengthened (the following examples are from Couvreur

A similar phenomenon occurs in Arabic, where, according to the native
grammarians, 7 is weakened and even lost with compensatory vowel lengthening
when the loss takes place between a preceding short vowel and a following
consonant (cf. Cantineau 1960:79; Moscati 1964:61-62, §9.20). In Hebrew and
Aramaic, *? and *y have merged into '' Λ7, and *H and *x have merged into h Ihl.
Only *?, *h, *h, and *ì are to be reconstructed for Proto-Afroasiatic (cf. D.
Cohen 1968:1305—1306). Labialized varieties of these sounds may also have existed
(cf. Diakonoff 1975:142). These sounds were generally preserved in the earlier stages
of the Afroasiatic daughter languages, the main exceptions being Berber, where they
were completely lost, and Chadic, where they also seem to have been mostly lost (so
Newman 1977, but not according to Stolbova 1987).

2.11. The Proto-Afroasiatic Vowel System
Six vowels are traditionally posited for Proto-Semitic (cf. Moscati 1964:46,

Proto-Semitic is also assumed to have had sequences of *a plus *y and *a plus
*w (cf. Moscati 1964:54, §8.97). The oldest Egyptian (cf. Callendar 1975:8-9;
Gardiner 1957:428-433; Vergote 1973.1b:39) and Common Berber (cf. Prasse
1975:223) probably had vowel systems identical to that posited for Proto-Semitic.
Ancient Egyptian may also have had a schwa-like vowel as well. According to
Sasse (1979:5), Proto-East Cushitic had ten vowels:
Ehret (1980:38) reconstructs fourteen vowels for Proto-Southern Cushitic. Ehret
notes, however, that this system may have developed from an earlier six-vowel
system similar to that reconstructed for Proto-Semitic.

Finally, Newman (1977:11) assumes that Proto-Chadic had, at most, four phonemic
vowels:
On the basis of a comparison of the vowel systems reconstructed for the
various Afroasiatic daughter languages, it would appear that a vowel system
identical to that posited for Proto-Semitic is also to be posited for Proto-Afroasiatic
as well, at least for the period of development existing immediately prior to the
2.11. The Proto-Afroasiatic Vowel System 107
emergence of the Afroasiatic daughter languages. However, when the vocalic
patterning is subjected to careful analysis, it becomes clear that such a reconstruction
does not represent the original state, although, as noted by Diakonoff (1965:31, fn.
40), all of the Afroasiatic daughter languages may have gone through the six-vowel
stage (a, i, u; ä, i, ü) at some point in their development.
The problems of vocalic patterning — within the larger context of root
structure patterning in Proto-Semitic — have been thoroughly investigated by
Diakonoff (1970:453-480, 1975:133-151, and 1992:65-97). According to Diakonoff,
in non-derivative nominal stems, the vocalic patterning differs from that posited for
Proto-Semitic as a whole:
A. There are no original long vowels in non-derivative nominal stems.
B. The vowel *u seems to be in allophonic alternation with the vowel *i in
non-derivative nominal stems, being found mainly before or after the
labials *plh
1, *b, and *m, after the gutturals *k[h
], *g, and *k' (when
from earlier *kw
lh
], *gw
, and *k'w
), and occasionally also after the
glottal stop *? (perhaps from earlier *?w
[?]). This point leads Diakonoff
to suggest that *i and *w are to be derived from an earlier vocalic entity,
which he writes *a. Diakonoff also notes that unstressed *a could appear
as either *a or *i in the Semitic daughter languages.
C. If a non-derivative nominal stem has the shape *C,V C2C3l then either
C2 or C3 is *?, *y, *w, *m, *n, */, *r. If it is *C2 that is one of these
phonemes, then the vowel is *a. This leads Diakonoff to posit syllabic
résonants similar to those reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European and
Proto-Kartvelian. In my opinion, however, the evidence from the
remaining branches of Afroasiatic does not appear to support the view
that the Afroasiatic parent language possessed syllabic résonants.
Diakonoff then continues by discussing the ramifications of his theories, including
the patterning in verbal stems.
For our purposes, the most important points made by Diakonoff are as follows:
A. Proto-Afroasiatic had a vertical vowel system — *a — similar to that
reconstructed for Proto-Northwest Caucasian (cf. Colarusso 1975:292—417
and 1981:499-502).
B. There were no long vowels in Proto-Afroasiatic. The long vowels found
in the Afroasiatic daughter languages are all secondarily derived.
108 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Recently, Orel—Stolbova (1988:66—83) have analyzed vowel correspondences in
non-derivative nominal stems in West Chadic, Semitic, and Proto-Coptic. They
have also noted that the original vocalism of verbs is represented by West Chadic
and Arabic imperfectives. Their analysis leads them to reconstruct six vowels for
Proto-Afroasiatic: *a, *e, *i, *o, *u, and *ü. This reconstruction is based on the
following correspondences:
Proto- Proto- Proto-West Proto-
AA Semitic Chadic Coptic
*a *a *a *a/*o
*e *i *ya *e
*i *i *i *e/*i
*o *u *wa *e
*u *u/*a *u *u/*o
*Ü *i *u *i
Since Diakonoff's arguments seem more persuasive, it is his views on Proto-
Afroasiatic vocalism that are followed in this book.
In this book, the following vowel system has been reconstructed for pre-
Proto-Indo-European and pre-Proto-Kartevlian. Such a system may also be set up
for pre-Proto-Afroasiatic:
i ~ e u ~ o
d ~ a
Also the sequences: iy ~ ey uy ~ oy ay ~ ay
iw ~ ew uw ~ ow dw ~ aw
The primary vowels were *i, *a, and *u. These vowels must have been subject to
considerable subphonemic variation — the front and back vowels *i and *u may be
assumed to have had lowered variants, while the central low vowel *a may be
assumed to have had higher variants. In pre-Proto-Afroasiatic, the high allophones
merged into *3, and the low allophones merged into *a.
2.12. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Afroasiatic 109
2.12. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Afroasiatic
There has been much discussion, some of it rather heated, concerning root
structure patterning within Afroasiatic. Until fairly recently, there was strong
resistence to look objectively at the data from all of the branches of the Afroasiatic
language family, far too much emphasis being placed on the importance of the
Semitic branch alone, which was often uncritically taken to represent the original
state of affairs.
In the Semitic branch, the vast majority of roots are triconsonantal. It is
certain, however, that at one time there were more biconsonantal roots and that the
triconsonantal system has been greatly expanded in Semitic at the expense of roots
with other than three consonants (cf. Moscati 1964:72-75; Ullendorf 1958:69-72). In
particular, we may note Diakonoffs (1984:1—2) comments on Afroasiatic root
structure patterning:
The latest argument which has recently been advanced in favour of retaining
the term 'Hamitic' was, as far as I know, the supposed fact that the Hamitic
roots are mainly biconsonantal while those of Semitic are triconsonantal. Our
work on the Comparative Historical Vocabulary of Afrasian (CHVA) has
shown without a shadow of a doubt that this is wrong. The Common Afrasian
roots were in principle biconsonantal; most of them have been extended to a
triconsonantal status either by reduplicating the second consonant of the root,
or by adding a real or fictitious 'weak' consonant (forming either mediae
infirmae or tertiae infirmae roots); the choice between the formation of a
secundae geminatae, a mediae infirmae or a tertiae infirmae secondary
stem is virtually non-predictable (i.e. these types of the root are allomorphic at
the Proto-Afrasian level). An additional method of forming secondary roots is
the one well known from Proto-Indo-European, viz., the adding of a suffixed
(very rarely a prefixed) consonant 'complement' to the root. In about 90% of
the cases (at least in that part of the vocabulary which we hive worked
through) the so-called 'three-consonantal roots' can with a great certainty be
derived from well attested biconsonantal roots plus a complement which is
used to modify the main semantics of the biconsonantal roots. Note that the
'biconsonantal cum complement' roots are well attested not only in Semitic but
also in Cushitic, Berber and Egyptian, and though they are somewhat more
rare in Chadic and some of the Cushitic languages, the reason for this
phenomenon is: (1) the loss of external inflection which later also caused
losses in the final stem consonants and (2) the loss of a number of Proto-
Semitic phonemes in Late Stage languages.
110 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Recent work by Ehret (1989b: 109-202) closes the case. Through careful
analysis, fully supported by well-chosen examples from Arabic, Ehret demonstrates
that the third consonantal elements of Semitic triconsonantal roots were originally
suffixes, which, in the majority of cases examined by him, had served as verb
extensions. In particular, he identifies and categorizes thirty-seven such extensions.
Expanding his argumentation to include the other branches of Afroasiatic, he notes:
The morphological history that can be proposed from the materials presented
here is unusual but not especially complicated. Early on in the evolution of
the Afroasiatic language family, all or nearly all of the consonants of PAA had
developed the capacity to act as verb extensions, modifying the meaning of
simple biconsonantal roots in regularly definable ways. In Cushitic and Chadic
many of these extensions became nonproductive during the evolution of the
mother languages of these branches of the family and before the ends
respectively of the Proto-Cushitic and Proto-Chadic periods, probably well
before. Relatively few of the extended roots containing these suffixes became
lexicalized and maintained as distinct roots; in Proto-Cushitic they probably
constituted 10-15 percent of the vocabulary. In the evolution of Egyptian,
Berber, and Semitic, however, these extensions must have remained productive
for a longer period, so that when they finally ceased to be active elements of
morphology, a much larger proportion of the vocabulary in those three came
to be lexicalized extended roots. In Semitic this process was carried the
furthest, the outcome being a system in which the great majority of verb roots
were of such origin. Verbal morphology presumed a triliteral surface of
contact with the verb root. In consequence, the remaining biconsonantal verbs
were converted formally into triconsonantals by a morphologically rather than
semantically motivated gemination of the second consonant.
We may establish the following chronology for the branching off of the
various Afroasiatic daughter languages: Chadic must have been the first branch to
split from the rest of the Afroasiatic speech community. The next split was between
Omotic and Cushitic on the one hand and Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic on the
other. Finally, first Egyptian and then Berber split off from Semitic.
Now, the Proto-Afroasiatic root may be assumed to have had two forms,
either *CV or *CVC. As in pre-Proto-Indo-European, *CVC could be extended by
means of a suffix to form an inflectional stem: *CVC-VC~. Originally, these
suffixes appear to have been utilized primarily as verb extensions. Depending upon
when they became separated from the rest of the Afroasiatic speech community,
each branch exploited to a different degree the patterning that was just beginning to
2.13. Uralic-Yukaghir 111
develop in the Afroasiatic parent language, with Semitic carrying it to the farthest
extreme.
It thus emerges that the rules governing the structural patterning of roots and
stems in the earliest form of Proto-Afroasiatic (cf. Diakonoff 1988:42—56) are
surprisingly similar to the rules posited for the earliest form of Proto-Indo-European:
1. There were no initial vowels in the earliest form of Proto-Afroasiatic.
Therefore, every root began with a consonant.
2. Originally, there were no initial consonant clusters either. Consequently,
every root began with one and only one consonant.
3. Two basic syllable types existed: (A) *CV and (B) *CVC, where C = any
non-syllabic and V = any vowel. Permissible root forms coincided
exactly with these two syllable types.
4. A verbal stem could either be identical with a root or it could consist of
a root plus a single derivational morpheme added as a suffix to the root:
*CVC~VC~. Any consonant could serve as a suffix.
5. Primary (that is, non-derivative) nominal stems displayed similar
patterning, though, unlike the verbal stems, they originally were
characterized by stable vocalism.
There were three fundamental stem types in Proto-Afroasiatic: (A) verbal
stems, (B) nominal and adjectival stems, and (C) pronominal and indeclinable stems.
Only pronominal and indeclinable stems could end in a vowel. Verbal and nominal
stems, on the other hand, had to end in a consonant (cf. Diakonoff 1988:42; this is
the stem patterning posited for Proto-Southern Cushitic [cf. Ehret 1980:45—47]).
As in Proto-Indo-European, the consonants carried the basic meaning of the
stem, while the vowels were used as modifiers: that is to say that grammatical
categorization was partially achieved by means of fixed vocalic patterning, at least
in the verbal stems.
2.13. Uralic-Yukaghir
Even though the Uralic language family is part of a larger grouping called
Uralic-Yukaghir (cf. Ruhlen 1987:64—65), only Uralic proper will be discussed in
this section.
112 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
There are still many uncertainties regarding the reconstruction of the
Proto-Uralic vowels. The system followed in this book for Proto-Uralic reflects
that proposed by Décsy (1990:22). In the Proto-Finno-Ugrian examples cited in this
book, however, the vowels are generally given in accordance with Rédei (1986—
1988). Décsy's system is as follows:
i u
e o
ä a
Vowel harmony is a notable phonological characteristic of the Uralic
languages. In those Uralic languages exhibiting vowel harmony, the system is
generally based upon a front ~ back contrast, most often with the vowels i and
e being neutral in regards to this contrast and thus able to combine freely with
either front or back vowels, though absolute consistency is unusual. The vowel
harmony systems found in the Uralic languages thus differ in this respect from those
found in the Altaic languages, especially Turkic and Mongolian, where more
consistent systems are the rule. At the Proto-Uralic level, the system of vowel
harmony was based exclusively upon a front ~ back contrast. This affected the
distributional patterning of vowels in such a way that only front vowels could
combine with front vowels and only back vowels with back vowels in a given word.
The basic rule is that the vowels of non-initial syllables adjust to the vowel of the
initial syllable. Thus, the following combinations were permitted (cf. Décsy 1990:36):
Front Back
l ~ a u ~ a
e ~ ä 0 ~ a
ä ~ à a ~ a
A key point of this scheme is the assumption by Décsy (1990:39—43) that only
*ä and *a could appear in non-initial syllables. Other Uralic scholars maintain that
*e could also occur in non-initial syllables. It is Décsy's views on vowel harmony
that are followed in this book. For other views, cf. Sammallahti 1988:481 and 486.
There were probably three degrees of stress contrast in Proto-Uralic (cf. Décsy
1990:48—49): (A) strongest, (B) weak, and (C) weakest. These are relative terms —
2.13. Uralic-Yukaghir 113
the actual intensity differences between these three degrees was not great. The rule
is that the strongest degree always fell on the first syllable of a word, and the
weakest always on the last. The weak degree fell on odd non-initial syllables
(except for the final syllable), while the weakest degree fell on even non-initial
syllables and the final syllable.
There is broad agreement among Uralic scholars concerning Proto-Uralic
consonantism. Though most consonants could appear both initially and medially, a
small number were found only medially. Word initially, Proto-Uralic had the
following sounds (cf. Collinder 1965:75-83): *p~, *t~, *k~, *t~s- (traditional *c-),
*ty- (traditional *c~), *s-, (traditional *s~), *s~, *Sy- (traditional *<5'-), *y~,
*w-, */-, *ly- (traditional */'-), *r~, *ny- (traditional *«-), *«-, and *m~. Medially
between vowels, the following sounds were found (cf. Collinder 1965:83—92): *-p~,
*-t-, *-k-, *-t's
-, *-ty-, *-s-, *-sy~, *-$-, * - y - , *-S-, *-¿y-, *-y-, *-w-, *-/-,
*-ly-, *-r-, *-T¡-, *-rjk-, *-¡}t-, *-«-, *-nt-, *-ny-, *-m-, *-mt-, and *-mp~.
The Proto-Uralic consonant system may be reconstructed as follows (cf.
Austerlitz 1968:1375-1377; Collinder 1965:75-94; Décsy 1990:25):
Ρ t i* ty k
δ ¿y y
s s sy
m η ny 0
r ι ly
w y
Consonant harmony is another notable characteristic of the Uralic: languages.
As an active phonological feature, consonant harmony is not as widespread as vowel
harmony, being found exclusively in Balto-Finnic and Lapp (though there are traces
in Mordvin and Cheremis [Mari]). Consonant harmony is based upon a contrast, in
different forms of the same word, between (A) medial voiceless geminai ed stops at
the beginning of an open syllable versus medial single voiceless slops at the
beginning of a closed syllable, on the one hand, and between (B) medial single
voiceless stops at the beginning of an open syllable versus medial voiced stops,
fricatives, or zero at the beginning of a closed syllable, on the other hand.
Diachronically, the system of consonant harmony may be viewed as a weakening of
the phonetic value of a consonant before closed syllables. This resulted in the
correlation of so-called "strong-grade" variants with open syllables and "weak-grade"
variants with closed syllables. Even though consonant harmony began as a purely
phonetic process, it became morphologized in those languages where it developed.
114 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Later on, varying amounts of leveling took place. In Estonian, in particular, so
many diachronic changes have taken place that there is no longer a readily
discernable correlation between strong-grade and open syllable nor between
weak-grade and closed syllable.
2.14. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Uralic
Morphologically, the Uralic languages are underlyingly agglutinating, though
many of the modern languages, especially Estonian, which has innovated
considerably, have deviated from the original type. Proto-Uralic root structure
patterning was fairly straightforward:
1. There were no initial consonant clusters in Proto-Uralic (cf. Décsy
1990:26). Medial clusters were permitted, however (cf. Décsy 1990:27).
2. Three syllable types were permitted: *V, *CV, and *CVC (cf. Décsy
1990:34—35). Initially, *V comes from earlier *HV, upon loss of the
preceding laryngeal.
3. All Proto-Uralic words ended in a vowel (cf. Décsy 1990:26 and 54).
4. Derivational suffixes had the form *-CV (cf. Décsy 1990:58).
Proto-Uralic did not differentiate between nominal and verbal stems (cf. Décsy
1990:56). Only the pronouns existed as an independent stem type.
2.15. Elamo-Dravidian
Even though the Dravidian languages are closely related to Elamite (cf.
MeAlpin 1974 and 1981), which together form a larger grouping called Elamo-
Dravidian, only Dravidian will be discussed in this section.
Word initially, there were only voiceless stops in Proto-Dravidian. This is still
the situation found in Tamil. On the basis of the reflexes found in South Dravidian
languages and Telugu, a series of alveolars distinct from dentals and retroflexes has
been reconstructed for Proto-Dravidian. A notable feature of Proto-Dravidian
consonantism is the absence of sibilants. Medially, Proto-Dravidian had a contrast
between geminate (including the clusters of nasal plus consonant) and non-geminate
consonants. Initially and medially in combination with other stops, *p, *t, *k, and
2.15. Elamo-Dravidian 115
*c were voiceless; between vowels and before nasals, they were voiced — the voicing
was not phonemic. The geminates were voiceless.
Proto-Dravidian had five short vowels (*e, *o, *a, *i, *u) and five long vowels
(*é, *ö, *ä, *î, *ü) plus the sequences *Vy and *Vv (< *Vw).
The reconstruction shown below is close to that set up by Zvelebil (1970:77)
for Proto-Dravidian. However, I have followed Burrow—Emeneau (1974:xii—xiii) in
their representation of the alveolar as *i_ instead of *f, even though the evidence
from the Dravidian daughter languages points to underlying III at the Proto-
Dravidian level. The reason for my decision to represent the Proto-Dravidian
phoneme as * l instead of *t_ is based on the observation that this phoneme
corresponds to r in the closely-related Elamite (though there is some room for
interpretation here) as well as in the other Nostratic languages.
The Proto-Dravidian phonological system is as follows (cf. Burrow—Emeneau
1984:xii—xiii; Subrahmanyam 1983:40; Zvelebil 1970:35 and 76-77):

There is a widespread alternation in the Dravidian daughter languages between
intervocalic - c - and -y~. Comparison with other Nostratic languages indicates that
we are dealing with original *sy in such cases. We may note the following examples:

2.16. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Dravidian 117
2.16. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Dravidian
Morphologically, the Dravidian languages are fundamentally agglutinating (cf.
Zvelebil 1977:3). In Proto-Dravidian, the basic root type was monosyllabic (cf.
Caldwell 1913:196-197; Zvelebil 1977:3), though there is some indication that an
extremely small number of bisyllabic roots may have to be reconstructed at the
Proto-Dravidian level as well. This is, however, by no means certain, and it is best
at present to regard Proto-Dravidian roots as exclusively monosyllabic. Inflectional
categorization was achieved by means of suffixes added directly to the lexical roots
or to the lexical roots extended by means of derivational suffixes. Any vowel, long
or short, could appear in a root, but only *a, *i, or *u could appear in a suffix.
The following root types may be assumed to have existed in Proto-Dravidian
(cf. Subrahmanyam 1983:13-35): (A) *V- and *CV-, (B) *V- and *CV-, (C)
*VC- and *CVC-, (D) *VC- and *CVC~, (E) *VCC- and *CVCC-, (F) *VCC- and
*CVCC~. *V- and *CV- almost always occurred with a derivational suffix;
*V- and *CV- could occur both with and without a derivational suffix; *VC- and
*CVC- could occur both with and without a derivational suffix; *VCC- and
*CVCC~ could occur both with and without a derivational suffix in bisyllabic
nominal stems, while in verbal stems, they always occurred without — they
alternated with *VC- and *CVC- before a derivational suffix in verbal stems and
trisyllabic nominal stems; *VCC- and *CVCC- could occur both with arid without a
derivational suffix in bisyllabic nominal stems, but in verbal stems, i.hey always
occurred without.
Roots ending in a vowel were followed by derivational suffixes beginning with
a consonant, while roots ending in a consonant could be followed by derivational
suffixes beginning with either a consonant or a vowel, though those beginning with a
vowel were by far the most common type. Derivational suffixes beginning with a
vowel could consist of (A) the simple vowel itself (*-V~), (B) the vowel plus a
single consonant (*-VC~), (C) the vowel plus a geminate stop (*-VCC-), (D) the
vowel plus the sequence of a nasal and its corresponding homorganic stop
(*-VNC~), or (E) the vowel plus the sequence of a nasal and its corresponding
homorganic geminate stop (*-VNCC~). In primary nominal stems, the derivational
suffix *-VCC- could be further extended by adding another suffix of the type
*-VC-. The derviational suffixes probably originally modified the meaning of the
stem in some way, though, as noted by Caldwell (1913:209), it is no longer possible,
in most cases, to discern their original meaning.
There were three fundamental form-classes in Proto-Dravidian (cf. Zvelebil
1977:6): (A) nominal, adjectival, and pronominal stems, (B) verbal stems, and (C)
indeclinables.

2.17. Altaic
As noted by Ruhlen (1987:128):
The study of the Altaic family has had a long and stormy history, and even
today there is considerable disagreement among specialists over exactly which
languages belong to the family.
Traditionally, Altaic has included the core groups (Chuvash-)Turkic, Mongolian, and
(Manchu-)Tungus, to which some have tried to add Korean, Japanese-Ryukyuan,
and Ainu. Looking at just the core group, one is hard-pressed to find features
common to all three. There are, to be sure, common features between (Chuvash-)
Turkic and Mongolian on the one hand and between Mongolian and (Manchu-)
Tungus on the other, but there appear to be relatively few features common to
(Chuvash-)Turkic and (Manchu-)Tungus alone. All three are, in fact, similar in
structure, but some scholars have considered this to be strictly a typological
characteristic. The common features found between the members of the core group
have been explained as due to diffusion, and, for a good portion of the common
lexical material, this seems to be a valid explanation (cf. Poppe 1965:157—163).
There are, however, features common (pronouns, to cite a single example) to the
members of the core group as a whole which cannot be explained as due to
diffusion, and which do indeed point to some sort of genetic relationship. The
problem is in trying to define the nature of that relationship. Two explanations are
possible: (A) The shared features are due to common descent from Proto-Nostratic
and do not imply a closer relationship among the three — according to this scenario,
(Chuvash-)Turkic, Mongolian, and (Manchu-)Tungus would have to be seen as three
independent branches of Nostratic. (B) The shared features are due to descent from
a common Altaic parent language intermediate between Proto-Nostratic and each of
the core group members. The problem with the first explanation is that it merely
shifts the question back to the Nostratic level without resolving a thing, whereas the
second explanation keeps the focus exactly where it belongs, namely, on the core
group. The second alternative thus remains a viable hypothesis (note here especially
Miller 1991:293—327). I would include the following groups within the Altaic
language family: (Chuvash-)Turkic, Mongolian, and (Manchu-)Tungus, but not
Korean, Ainu, and Japanese-Ryukyuan, which I believe should be treated separately,
though, of the three, Korean has the best chance of ultimately being Altaic. It
should be mentioned here that Benedict (1990) has recently made a rather strong
case for a genetic relationship between Japanese-Ryukyuan and the Austronesian
languages (which is not to deny that there are Altaic elements in Japanese-
2.17. Altaic 119
Ryukyuan). The features shared by (Chuvash-)Turkic, Mongolian, and (Manchu-)
Tungus should be looked upon as due to common descent from an Altaic parent
language. Language change over time has gradually led to increasing differentiation
between each of the three core group members, while diffusion, especially lexical
diffusion, has tended to complicate the picture by making it difficult to differentiate
between that which is borrowed and that which is truly genetically related.
Probably the most notable characteristic of the Altaic languages is the
assimilatory phenomenon known as "vówel harmony". In the Turkic languages, for
example, the first vowel segment occurring in a word influences the following vowel
segments so that all of the vowels in the word have certain features in common. In
Kirghiz, all of the vowels occurring in a given word must have the same feature for
front ~ back and for rounded ~ unrounded, while height distinctions do not figure
into the system of vowel harmony at all, so that high and non-high vowels can be
freely combined in a word. It was the development of the system of vowel
harmony that was responsible for the appearance of front rounded and back
unrounded vowels in Altaic. These vowels are, thus, a later development and
should not be reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic.
For Proto-Altaic phonology, I have followed the system proposed by Poppe
(1960). Proto-Altaic is assumed to have had a voicing contrast in stops and
affricates, but, as noted by Poppe (1960:9—10), there is a possibility that the contrast
could have been between voiceless aspirated and voiceless unaspirated stops and
affricates instead. An entirely different approach is taken by Illic-Svytic (1971- .1:
147—156), who reconstructs the three-way contrast of (A) voiceless aspirated, (B)
plain voiceless, and (C) plain voiced for Proto-Altaic. Neither the liquids nor the
velar nasal were found word initially. The voiceless stops and voiceless dental
affricate were strongly aspirated. Proto-Altaic had a rich system of long and short
vowels.
The Proto-Altaic phonological system may be reconstructed as follows:
Ρ
b
m
t
d
s
η
- / -
-r-
ts
d'z
ny
-ly-
-ry-
y
120 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
2.18. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Altaic
Like Uralic-Yukaghir and Elamo-Dravidian, the Altaic languages are
agglutinating in structure. Roots were monosyllabic, while stems could be either
monosyllabic, bisyllabic, or polysyllabic. The bisyllabic and polysyllabic stems were
derived from the monosyllabic stems by the addition of suffixes. The addition of
suffixes caused no changes to the vowel of the stem, but the vowels of the suffixes
were subject to vowel harmony, which means that their vowels were adjusted to the
vowel of the stem. The undifferentiated stems were real forms in themselves and
could be used without additional suffixes. The suffixes, both derivational and
inflectional, were added mechanically to the stem.
The following root types existed: (A) *V-, (B) *VC-, (C) *CV-, (D) *CVC-
and possibly (E) *CVCC- and (F) *VCC~, but not *CCV~.
There were four fundamental stem types in Proto-Altaic: (A) verbal stems, (B)
nominal and adjectival stems, (C) pronouns, and (D) particles. There was a strict
distinction between nominal and verbal stems.
2.19. Sumerian
In a series of recent, privately-circulated papers, Claude Boisson has been
exploring lexical parallels between Sumerian and other languages, especially the
Nilo-Saharan and Nostratic languages. Boisson has been very careful not to draw
wild conclusions from the data he has amassed about possible relationship of
Sumerian to other languages or language families. Yet, the lexical parallels he has
uncovered between Sumerian and the Nostratic languages, especially Dravidian,
though not numerous, look very promising and permit one to establish tentative
sound correspondences between Sumerian and the rest of Nostratic.
The Sumerian cuneiform syllabary distinguished the following sounds:
Ρ t
b d
k
g
s
ζ
s h
m η * ( = σ )
ι
r
a e u
2.20. Proto-Nostratic 121
There may have been corresponding long vowels as well. There were no initial
consonant clusters, while final consonants, especially t, d, k, g, m, n, and r, were
often omitted in the writing (cf. Thomsen 1984:42), which makes it difficult to
ascertain the form of the word. Internally, there was a tendency for consonants to
assimilate. The traditional transliteration shows a voicing contrast in stops. There is
a very strong probability, however, that the actual contrast was either between
voiceless aspirated versus voiceless unaspirated or simply between tense versus lax
(cf. Boisson 1989b:215—219; Thomsen 1984:43): traditional p, t, k = ph, t>>,
kh
respectively, while traditional b, d, g = ρ, t, k respectively. Traditional ζ may
have been an affricate (cf. Boisson 1989b:221—226). Lastly, Bauer's proposed dr
(cf.
Thomsen 1984:44) is highly questionable (cf. Boisson 1989b:212-214).
The Sumerian root was generally monosyllabic: CV, VC, and, most often,
CVC. There was no distinction between verbal roots and nominal roots — thus, for
example, dug could mean either 'good' or 'to be good'.
In the Sumerian texts, certain non-standard forms of speech can be discerned.
It is not entirely clear what this means — perhaps different dialects, jierhaps not;
perhaps so-called "refined speech", perhaps not. These forms, which have been
encountered mostly in religious texts, were labelled "Emesal" by the scribes, while
the standard forms were labelled "Emegir".
2.20. Proto-Nostratic
Proto-Nostratic had a rich system of stops and affricates. Each stop and
affricate series was characterized by the three-way contrast (A) voiceless (aspirated),
(B) voiced, and (C) glottalized. The aspiration of series (A) was phonemically
non-distinctive.
Three primary vowels may be reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic: *i, *a, and
*u, and this, along with the addition of the vowel e, is the situation reflected in
Sumerian, which is particularly conservative in regards to vocalism. These vowels
must have been subject to considerable subphonemic variation in the Nostratic parent
language. The high front and back vowels */ and *u may be assumed to have had
lowered variants, while the central low vowel *a may be assumed to have had
higher variants. It was the reanalysis, phonemicization, and exploitation of this
subphonemic variation that gave rise to the ablaut and vowel harmony patterning
found in the majority of the Nostratic daughter languages. In Afroasiatic, on the
other hand, the high allophones merged into and the low allophones merged into
*a. It is unclear whether phonemic long vowels existed in Proto-Nostratic as well,
though the evidence seems to indicate that they did not.

The Proto-Nostratic phonological system may tentatively be reconstructed as
follows:
Obstruents:
p ß l t [ h ]
b d
P' f
Glides:
w
Nasals and Liquids:
m η n.y η
I l y
r r y
Vowels:
i ~ e u ~ o
3 ~ a
Also the sequences: i y ~ e y uy ~ oy ay ~ ay
iw ~ ew uw ~ ow aw ~ aw
The palatalized velars are reconstructed solely on the basis of the reflexes
found in Afroasiatic, and their reconstruction at the Proto-Nostratic level is,
therefore, highly uncertain. I would like to be able to propose that the Afroasiatic
reflexes are due to an innovation in which plain velars were palatalized before front
vowels, but the evidence that I have gathered to date is simply too contradictory to
allow me to be able to make such a statement with even a modicum of certainty.

2.21. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Nostratic 123
Proto-Nostratic is similar to that found in Chukchi (cf. Greenberg 1990a:115):
High: i e u
3
Low: e a o
The Chukchi vowels form a system of vowel harmony in which the low members
(e, a, o) are labelled "dominant", and the high (/, e, u) "recessive". Native Chukchi
words must contain either all "dominant" vowels or all "recessive" vowels; the two
correspondents cannot co-exist in the same word. The schwa is neutral in regards to
the "dominant" ~ "recessive" contrast.
The system of vowel harmony found in Chukchi operates according to
different principles than the system found, for example, in Altaic. In Altaic, the
direction of vowel harmony is determined by the vowel of the root. In Chukchi, on
the other hand, a particular morpheme is either "dominant" or "recessive"; it is the
vowel of the "dominant" morpheme (this need not be the root) that influences the
remaining vowels.
According to Greenberg (1990a), traces of an earlier system of vowel harmony
can be discerned in Proto-Indo-European.
2.21. Root Structure Patterning in Proto-Nostratic
Comparison of the various Nostratic daughter languages, especially
Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian, and Proto-Afroasiatic, makes it possible to
determine the rules governing the structural patterning of roots and stems in
Proto-Nostratic. Most likely, the patterning was as follows:
1. There were no initial vowels in Proto-Nostratic. Therefore, every root
began with a consonant.
2. Originally, there were no initial consonant clusters either. Consequently,
every root began with one and only one consonant. Medial clusters were
permitted, however.
3. Two basic syllable types existed: (A) *CV and (B) *CVC, where C = any
non-syllabic and V = any vowel. Permissible root forms coincided
exactly with these two syllable types.
124 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
4. A stem could either be identical with a root or it could consist of a root
plus a single derivational morpheme added as a suffix to the root:
*CVC~VC~. Any consonant could serve as a suffix.
5. A stem could thus assume any one of the following shapes: (A) *CV~,
(B) *CVC~, (C) *CVC-VC~ (*CVC-C- as well, before vowels), or (D)
*CVC~CVC~. As in Proto-Altaic, the undifferentiated stems were real
forms in themselves and could be used without additional suffixes.
The original root structure patterning was maintained longer in Proto-
Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian, and Proto-Afroasiatic than in the other branches.
The root structure constraints found in Proto-Indo-European were an innovation.
Both the Proto-Dravidian and the Proto-Altaic root structure patterning can be
derived from earlier systems identical to what is posited above for Proto-Nostratic.
In Proto-Uralic, the rule requiring that all words end in a vowel was an innovation.
It should be mentioned here that reduplication was a widespread phenomenon.
On the basis of the evidence of Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian,
Proto-Afroasiatic, Proto-Dravidian, and Proto-Altaic, it may be assumed that there
were three fundamental stem types: (A) verbal stems, (B) nominal and adjectival
stems, and (C) pronominal and indeclinable stems. Uralic stands apart in showing no
differentiation between verbal and nominal stems. In Sumerian, though nominal and
verbal roots were identical in form, three separate word classes were distinguished:
(A) nouns, (B) verbs, and (C) adjectives. Returning to Proto-Nostratic, only
pronominal and indeclinable stems could end in a vowel. Verbal and nominal
stems, on the other hand, had to end in a consonant (though vowels could serve as
grammatical markers).
Morphologically, Proto-Nostratic may well have been an agglutinating
language. Those daughter languages that are highly inflectional, namely, Proto-
Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian, and Proto-Afroasiatic, may be assumed to have
gone through earlier periods of development as agglutinating languages. Such a
development is suggested for Indo-European by Bomhard (1988c:475—488) and, in
particular, Rasmussen (1987:107-122); see also Adrados (1989b and 1992).

2.23. From Proto-Nostratic to Proto-Indo-European
Now that we have completed discussing and comparing the phonological
systems of the individual Nostratic daughter languages, we are in a position to trace
the prehistoric development of the Proto-Indo-European phonological system.
The earliest form of pre-Proto-Indo-European that can be reconstructed most
likely had the following phonemic inventory:
Obstruents:

The correspondences between the Proto-Indo-European labial, dental, and
velar stops as well as the glides, nasals, and liquids, on the one hand, and those of
2.23. From Proto-Nostratic to Proto-Indo-European 133
the other Nostratic languages, on the other hand, are fairly straightforward and
require no further comment.
Lateralized affricates have been reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic primarily on
the basis of the Afroasiatic evidence. The earliest change that took place must have
been the development of the lateralized affricates into velar stops in pre-Proto-
Indo-European. Steiner (1977:40), citing Trubetzkoy, mentions that the development
of lateralized affricates into palatal, velar, or uvular stops (or affricates) is a
common development in the Northeast Caucasian languages, thus:

A similar shift may be posited for pre-Proto-Indo-European (as well as for pre-
Proto-Altaic, it may be mentioned).
The palatalized alveolars reconstructed for Proto-Nostratic primarily on the
basis of the Afroasiatic and Uralic evidence correspond to dental stops in
Proto-Indo-European. Two explanations are possible to account for this
correspondence: (A) Proto-Indo-European retained the original value, and the
palatalized alveolars were secondarily derived from earlier dental stops through
palatalization in the other languages, or (B) the other languages reflect the original
patterning, and the Indo-European developments are secondary. The overwhelming
testimony of the other Nostratic daughter languages favors the second alternative.
Typological considerations also point in this direction. In general, a contrast
between velars and labiovelars, such as that posited for Proto-Indo-European in this
book, implies a frontal contrast of some kind. There are various ways in which this
frontal contrast can be realized: (A) palatalized alveolar stops, (B) palato-alveolar
134 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
affricates, (C) dental affricates. It may thus be assumed that the palatalized alveolar
stops were original and that they were eliminated in pre-Proto-Indo-European
through merger with the plain dental stops (as has happened, for example, in the
case of Aramaic, where Proto-Semitic *dy, *t'.V, *tyfh] have become Aramaic d, t,
t respectively [cf. Moscati 1964:29—30, §8.18]). As a matter of fact, all original
palatalized sounds were lost in pre-Proto-Indo-European, merging with their
non-palatalized counterparts:
Pre-Proto-Indo-European Early Proto-Indo-European
dy > d (later d[h])
ty[h] > tßl
t'y > t'
ny > η
ly > I
ry > r
gy > g (later g[h])
ky[h] > k[h]
k'y > k'
Pre-Proto-Indo-European was followed by the Phonemic Stress Stage of
Proto-Indo-European, which is the earliest stage of Proto-Indo-European proper that
can be reconstructed. This stage was characterized by the phonemicization of a
strong stress accent that caused the reduction and elimination of the vowels of
unaccented syllables — that is to say that the phonemicization of a strong stress
accent was responsible for the development of quantitative vowel gradation. This
change was the first in a long series of changes that brought about the
grammaticalization of what began as a purely phonological alternation, totally
restructuring the earlier, pre-Proto-Indo-European vocalic patterning. This
restructuring of the vowel system was a continuous process which maintained vitality
throughout the long, slowly-evolving prehistory of the Indo-European parent
language itself and even into the early stages of some of the daughter languages.
Whether or not these series of changes were influenced by or themselves influenced
the patterning developing in Proto-Kartvelian cannot yet be ascertained with
absolute certainty. What is certain, though, is that the parallels between the systems
of vowel gradation in Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Kartvelian are so close that
coincidence can be all but ruled out. What needs to be determined still is the exact
nature, extent, and direction of any influence that may have occurred.
2.23. From Proto-Nostratic to Proto-Indo-European 135
It was during the Phonemic Stress Stage of Proto-Indo-European that the
syllabic résonants came into being. Lengthened-grade vowels may also have first
appeared during this stage of development.
The phonological system of the Phonemic Stress Stage of Proto-Indo-European
may be reconstructed as follows:
Obstruents:
pß] m ts[h] k[h] h] (qßli
b d dz 8 gw (G)
ρ' t' ts' k· k·» (q·) (q'w

Γνν ~ èw ûw ~ ôw éw ~ äw
136 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
Note:
A. *3 > *e under stress.
Phonemic Analysis:
A. Obstruents: always non-syllabic.
B. Résonants (glides, nasals, and liquids): syllabicity determined by surroundings:
the résonants were syllabic when between two non-syllabics and non-syllabic
when either preceded or followed by a vowel.
C. Vowels: always syllabic.
Suprasegmentals:
A. Stress: applied only to vowels; distribution correlated with grammatical
categorization.
B. Pitch: non-distinctive.
In the latest period of Proto-Indo-European (what I call "Disintegrating
Indo-European"), quantitative ablaut was no longer a productive process. Had there
been a strong stress accent at this time, each Proto-Indo-European word could have
had only one syllable with full-grade vowel, the vowels of the unstressed syllables
having all been eliminated. However, since the majority of reconstructed
Proto-Indo-European words have more than one full-grade vowel, the stress accent
must have become non-distinctive at some point prior to the latest stage of
development.
As Proto-Indo-European began to build the morphological system of
grammatical categorization based upon the use of inflectional endings, it must often
have happened that more than one syllable of a word came to be considered
morphologically significant. For example, according to the rules of derivation and
inflection, the initial syllable of a word may have received the stress. At the same
time, an inflectional ending may have been added, and this ending, in order not to
be morphologically ambiguous, may also have had a full-grade vowel in addition to
the one found in the stressed syllable. By the same token, when the shift of accent
from, say, the stem to the ending would have produced unpronounceable consonant
clusters, the vowel of the stem was retained.
It is probable that the Proto-Indo-European stress was pronounced with special
intonations that helped to make the accented syllable more discernable. When
words with more than one full-grade vowel came into being, stress ceased to be
phonemically distinctive. Phonemic pitch then replaced stress as the primary
2.23. From Proto-Nostratic to Proto-Indo-European 137
suprasegmental indicator of morphologically distinctive syllables, and the accent lost
its ability to weaken and/or eliminate the vowels of unaccented syllables. The
primary contrast was then between morphologically distinctive syllables with
full-grade vowel and high pitch and morphologically non-distinctive syllables with
full-grade vowel and low pitch. This period of development may be called the
Phonemic Pitch Stage of Proto-Indo-European.
On the basis of the evidence from the majority of Nostratic daughter
languages, a series of dental affricates has been reconstructed for the Nostratic parent
language. This series is also reflected in Proto-Indo-European by dsntal stops.
Again, two explanations are possible: (A) the original value was preserved in
Proto-Indo-European or (B) the other languages reflect the original patterning, and
the Indo-European developments are secondary. The second alternative is clearly
the most likely. Therefore, we must assume that the dental affricates underwent
deaffricatization in Proto-Indo-European and merged with the dental stops (a similar
development has taken place, for instance, in the case of the Proto-Semitic
glottalized dental affricate *ts
' [traditional *sj in the Southern Ethiopian Semitic
languages Amharic, Gurage, Harari, Gafat, and Argobba: *ts
' > f). I assume that
the dental affricates were eliminated during the Phonemic Pitch Stage of Proto-
Indo-European.
The final changes that must be assigned to the Phonemic Pitch Stage of
Proto-Indo-European were (A) the merger of the earlier postvelars with the plain
velars and (B) the development of the voiceless and voiced pharyngeal fricatives into
voiceless and voiced multiply-articulated pharyngeal/laryngeal fricatives respectively:
*h > *M and > *SJ.

Notes:
A. High vowels have sub-phonemic low variants when contiguous with so-called
"α-coloring" laryngeals (*h, *hh, and *Ϋβ).

European that the Anatolian languages became separated from the main speech
community.

B. Pitch: distribution morphologically-conditioned: high pitch is applied to
morphologically-distinctive vowels, while low pitch is applied to
morphologically-non-distinctive vowels.
During the Phonemic Pitch Stage of development, the system of vowel
gradation assumed the following form (*a = traditional schwa secundum):

2.23. From Proto-Nostratic to Proto-Indo-European 139
The Phonemic Pitch Stage of Proto-Indo-European was followed by
Disintegrating Indo-European, which may be defined as the stage of development
existing between the separation of the Anatolian languages from the main speech
community and the emergence of the non-Anatolian daughter languages. John C.
Kerns prefers to refer to this period as "PIE-Proper".
The Disintegrating Indo-European phonological system may be reconstructed as
follows:
1. Obstruents: pß] t[h] kßl k">[h1
b[h] d[h] glh
l g»[f>]
(P') t' le- k'w
2. Nasals and Liquids: m/m

3. Glides: y/i w/u
4. Laryngeal: h/h
5. Vowels: e o a (0 (u) 3
è δ ä i" Ü
Notes:
A. The voiced stops become voiced aspirates. As in the voiceless series, the
aspiration is non-phonemic.
B. The high vowels *i and *u become mostly integrated into the system of
résonants.
C. Apophonic *a becomes *o.
D. The laryngeals *? and *h are lost initially before vowels. In all other
environments, *? and *h merge into *h.
E. At the same time, the laryngeals *hh and *?fi become *h.
F. Later, the single remaining laryngeal *h is lost initially before vowels (except
in pre-Proto-Armenian) and medially between an immediately preceding
140 2. Comparative Phonology of the Nostratic Languages
vowel and a following non-syllabic. This latter change causes compensatory
lengthening of preceding short vowels.
G. The laryngeal *h is preserved in all other positions. Between two non-
syllables, *h has a vocalic allophone, which may be represented as *h — this is
the schwa primum of traditional grammar.
H. The velar stops *k[h
], *g[h
], and *k' develop palatalized allophones when
contiguous with front vowels and *y.
I. In some dialects of Disintegrating Indo-European, the glottalics are realized as
implosives, *ß, *cC, *cf, *g~w
.
During the Disintegrating Indo-European period of development, the system of
vowel gradation appeared as follows:
I. Short Vowel Gradation:
Lengthened-Grade Normal-Grade Reduced-Grade Zero-Grade
A. è ~ ö e ~ o 3 0
Β. èy ~ öy ey ~ oy i, 3yV y
ëw ~ öw ew ~ ow u, 3wV w

II. Long Vowel Gradation:

3. NOSTRATIC MORPHOLOGY AND SYNTAX {John C. Kerns)
3.1. Introduction
The comparative morphology and syntax of the Nostratic families is still
largely an unplowed field. While some comparative studies of morphology or
syntax have been offered in regard to pairs of individual Nostratic families, it seems
that very few have appeared concerning Nostratic as a whole. Apparently the cause
of this is simply that the Nostratic macrofamily itself has never been generally
accepted by the academic community as a unitary object of study. This is not
surprising. The very nature of academic activity tends to concentrate one's attention
onto a narrow field while overlooking phenomena in separate but related fields.
This is unfortunate since it sometimes happens that the results in one area will have
a crucial bearing on certain questions in another; sometimes problems can be solved
by extending one's attention to more than one field. This is the case, for example,
with the origin of gender in Indo-European, which can be understood when
reference is made to Uralic.
All this is understandable in view of the historical and academic situations.
Since the time depths among these families are necessarily older than within the
families individually, it is inevitable that the resemblances among them would be
less compelling in their implications for a prehistoric genetic relationship.
Furthermore, the very existence of these families expands the field of comparison
enormously, so much so that it is difficult for a scholar to become well versed in
more than a small proportion of them, the rest remaining only superficially
understood.
In addition, the study of the non-linguistic prehistory of the Nostratic speaking
peoples, available only from archeological investigations, is still in its infancy. And
even if the study were mature, the significance of its data for elucidating Nostratic
problems would forever remain in doubt, for the archeological remains of preliterate
populations are uninformative in regard to language. This is regrettable since it
deprives us of an understanding of prehistoric tribal movements and circumstantial
situations that must have had an intimate effect on linguistic developments.
Nevertheless, some of these can be traced or at least surmised, though only in
outline.
But why take the Nostratic macrofamily seriously at all? The reason we do so
142 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
is that a number of scholars have at times become acquainted with more than one
Nostratic family and have immediately noticed features of various kinds that
reminded them of similar features in other families, usually Indo-European or
Uralic, the two families aside from Afroasiatic that have been most intensively
studied. This constitutes a process of gestalt recognition which in essence is the
same as that employed by Sir William Jones in his discovery of the Indo-European
family, the relative paucity of comparative data notwithstanding. Gestalt recognition
involves observing all the known (or assumed) Nostratic families simul-
taneously and fitting the recurrent phenomena into a consistent pattern. It is, in
fact, a process of pattern recognition, a recognition of a consistent underlying
order that can be dimly discerned against the noisy background of linguistic changes
variously accumulated through many millennia.
The value of gestalt recognition as a powerful heuristic process is not to be
lightly dismissed. This is particularly so in cases where the time depths are so great
that most of the original morphological paradigms have been eroded and replaced,
in whole or in part. Bits and pieces of the old paradigms have survived, however,
by being incorporated independently into new paradigms in the descendant families,
and some of these features can be identified with considerable plausibility despite
their paucity and spotty occurrence. We come to notice these features because they
tend to recur in several families. After all, in view of what we know concerning
the activities of peripatetic human beings during the past thirty thousand years, the
existence of related linguistic families covering vast regions of relatively unrestricted
territory is not in the least surprising.
Some scholars have refused to accept the existence of the Nostratic
macrofamily because the comparative data are not as plentiful as within (say)
Indo-European or Uralic, neither in regard to vocabulary nor to morphological
paradigms. But such an attitude is inappropriate because of the greater time depth.
Even within such relatively compact and well studied families as these, the
implications of the comparative data are by no means as clear as sometimes
imagined. In regard to Uralic, Collinder (1959:303) states that the verbal paradigms
of Primitive Uralic, or even Primitive Finno-Ugric, cannot be reconstructed in
detail. And when we look at Indo-European, we see that the verbal structures of
Classical Greek and Indo-Iranian are radically different from those in Latin, Old
Irish, or Anatolian, and only with difficulty can we even approximately reconstruct
the paradigms of IE-Proper, not to mention Indo-European itself. Here I use
"IE-Proper" to subsume all the historically known branches of Indo-European except
Anatolian; I consider this distinction historically significant. It should be noted that
Bomhard uses the term "Disintegrating Indo-European" to indicate the latest stage of
"IE-Proper", when the non-Anatolian daughter languages were beginning to assume
their individual identities.
3.2. Scope of Discussion 143
This situation is particularly poignant considering the fact that, aside from
Afroasiatic and to a lesser degree Sumerian and Elamo-Dravidian, Indo-European is
the only Nostratic family that has yielded historical data from periods preceding the
Christian or Common Era. It is noteworthy that the scholarly opinions concerning
the "original" features of the reconstructed Indo-European have depended very much
on accidents of preservation or discovery of historically preserved material. In this
connection, if our knowledge of Latin were restricted to data available; only from
the modern Romance languages, we would have no hint of the existence of the
Latin passive and deponent forms in -r. Thus, the recording date of key items of
information is critically important to their ever being preserved, and in view of the
exceptional time depths separating the Nostratic families, it would be rash to assume
that we could ever warrant much confidence in any reconstruction we might make
of the "original" Nostratic morphology; nevertheless, I shall attempt a beginning at
this while bearing that reservation in mind.
Once we accept the reality of the Nostratic macrofamily, it has immediate
value for deepening our understanding of the prehistoric development of the
member families, much as an understanding of Indo-European enables us to identify
innovations in its member branches. Already we can see that such features of
Indo-European as gender, ablaut, the reduplication of the perfect, the declension of
adjectives in agreement with associated nouns, and most of the differentiation of the
declensional categories, were innovations. On the other hand, almost all the
pronouns, some verbal modes and tenses, several derivative formants, the plural in
- ι - and a considerable proportion of the nominal declension, including the
heteroclitic declension, were of Nostratic origin. In addition, the fundamental
syntactic principle of early Indo-European whereby a modifying element preceded
its head, with the consequent suffixation of grammatical elements and the
object-verb (OV) word order, was likewise inherited from Nostratic. Admittedly,
some of this can be deduced from internal evidence based on data restricted to
Indo-European alone, but the extra-Indo-European evidence confirms and
supplements it.
3.2. Scope of Discussion
In any exercise of comparative-historical linguistics, it is necessary for practical
reasons to limit the choice of languages, or groups of languages, to be included in
the discussion; generally, we use taxonomic boundaries that have resulted from
prehistoric linguistic evolution through the ages. Thus, the present book makes little
reference to such extra-Nostratic phyla as Amerindian, sub-Saharan languages or
Dene-Caucasian, the last conceived as tentatively including Basque, North Caucasian,
144 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
Burushaski, Sino-Tibetan, and Na-Dene in North America. Of course this does not
imply that these phyla are genetically unrelated to Nostratic.
On the other hand, I consider Etruscan to be a member of Nostratic and
probably an aberrant member of Indo-European, most closely related to Anatolian;
among other features unlikely to be due to borrowing, a major motivating
phenomenon is the genitive in -s, which I believe to be unique to Indo-European (J.
C. Kerns 1985:149-154; Pfiffig 1969).
In this book on Nostratic, the Etruscan, Eskimo-Aleut, Gilyak (Nivkh) and
Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages have been excluded from the phonological
discussion because the internal phonology and vocabulary in those groups have not
yet been worked out in adequate detail. On the other hand, the morphological
features of Eskimo-Aleut do include some striking similarities to corresponding
features in Uralic and Indo-European. Some of these are shared with Uralic, others
with Indo-European, and a few with both. These will be presented in due course.
Since I have little information on the Yukaghir branch of Uralic-Yukaghir,
most of my references to that family will be to Uralic alone.
I shall not attempt to set forth a comprehensive morphologic or syntactic
description or analysis of the individual Nostratic families or their constituent
languages as known today; that is a task for many scholars working through the
years. The results would have little relevance because of the many changes that
have accrued during the past 10,000 years or so. Besides, Bomhard has already
provided a description in the Introduction to this book that is sufficiently
comprehensive for the present. I shall be content to makel eclectic references as
needed in order to illustrate and explain those features that seem to be primordial.
Here "morphology" is regarded as largely synonymous with "grammar", with
little reference to the roots of words (root structure patterning is discussed by
Bomhard in the chapter on phonology). On the other hand, pronominal affixes are
an intimate part of grammar and will be treated as such.
3.3. The Pre-Neolithic Background
There is a curious paradox in the apparent relationships of Indo-European to
its neighboring families. On the one hand, as the phonological discussion in this
book shows, Indo-European displays an abundance of agreements with Afroasiatic
and Kartvelian in regard to consonantism and root structure patterning, yet each
shows relatively little agreement with Uralic. On the other hand, in regard to
syntactic structure, morphology, and pronominal affixes, Indo-European resembles
far more the families distributed along the Northern fringe of Eurasia and North
America, particularly Uralic, the Northern Tungusic branch of Altaic, and
3.3. The Pre-Neolithic Background 145
Eskimo-Aleut. The resolution of this paradox requires some understanding of the
Pre-Neolithic environment in these regions.
To begin with, man has been a peripatetic biped for some three or four
million years and was a habitual shaper and user of stone tools for at least two
million. These developments in Africa marked the acceleration of a process of
intellectual etherealization — a steady growth in mental vigor, a sharpening of wits,
a more daring imagination, a greater power to visualize and abstract, a more
retentive memory, a readiness to communicate — and an increasingly aggressive
prédation, which together have set us apart from our simian relatives. This has
culminated in the development of wide-ranging bands of hunter-gatherers with
splendid artistic powers, and of agriculture and the herding of domesticated animals,
urban civilizations, industrialization, and the sophisticated mathematical physics and
technology of today.
As is generally the case in evolution, our development has not been entirely
unilineal, for a few side-branches have fallen by the wayside, either by being
genetically absorbed in a one-sided process of hybridization as may have been the
case with Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis, or by being crowded out altogether as
in the case of Australopithecus Africanus and their vegetarian relatives. In all
cases, these extinctions seem to have been due to a local slackening or an actual halt
in the pace of etherealization.
The causative factor in this process seems to have been a succession of Ice
Ages briefly interrupted by interglacial periods with climates similar to that of the
present day. During the transitional phases, there were shifts in the locations of not
only the ice-free areas but also the regions watered by the rain-bearing winds,
which repeatedly presented new lands for exploitation while eliminating others; the
fluctuating boundaries of the Sahara Desert in Africa, above all, were involved in
this. If the new locations were readily accessible, those bands composed and led by
clever individuals would inevitably have been most favored to profit in these
situations, to discover and occupy the new lands and to thrive; the other bands
would tend to be expelled toward less favorable areas or become extinct by being
genetically or linguistically absorbed or starved out. Thus, there was a consistent
selective pressure in favor of increasing intellectual sophistication and aggressive
opportunism. This entailed the emergence of culture as a major evolutionary
medium, including the elaboration of languages with complicated grammars in the
historically known sense.
The overriding importance of the Sahara Desert in this process has been
described by Brian Fagan (1990). His major theme is the present controversy
between the "Candelabra" and the "Noah's Ark" models of recent human evolution.
The former model postulates that the present-day varieties of humanity had largely
separate origins in the era of Homo Erectus prominence, while the latter ascribes
146 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
them to relatively recent differentiations of Homo Sapiens. Like most investigators
in this field, he opts in favor of the Noah's Ark model, although he recognizes that
the issue is not as clear-cut as many enthusiasts assume. In his discussion, he
summarizes the recent results of several disciplines — paleoanthropology, genetics,
blood serology, and climate changes (especially in Africa).
Fagan likens the Sahara to a gigantic "pump" that alternately attracted and
repelled populations of animals and their human predators on a scale so vast that it
completely dominated the evolution of these creatures, animals and humans alike.
During the brief interglacials (of some 20,000 or 30,000 years duration), the Sahara
was relatively wet, with grasslands and a number of lakes, and the Southern savanna
extended far to the North, greatly expanding the range of predators and prey. Also,
migration Northward to the Mediterranean shore was relatively easy.
During the long glacial periods, however, dry sub-Arctic air prevailed in the
Sahara and exacerbated its desiccation. The area covered by the desert expanded,
causing the expulsion or extinction of the inhabitants, both animal and human. A
few of these were expelled Northward to the Mediterranean, crowding the
population there and increasing the likelihood of a trickle of migration across the
Sinai Peninsula into Palestine. However, throughout the remainder of the glacial
period access to the North was severely restricted.
Life on the savanna has always been difficult because of the endless cycles of
rain and drought, necessitating migrations every year. It is thought that about 5 to
10 million years ago some precursors of modern chimpanzees, having acquired an
increased taste for meat and being situated at the edge of their normal forest
environment, strayed too far into the savanna and got caught up in the maelstrom of
savanna activity. Most of them probably perished, but a few were sufficiently well
preadapted for bipedality that they managed to cope and leave viable descendants.
Thus humanity began. From first to last — from ape to Australopithecus
Afarensis, to Homo Habilis, to Homo Erectus, to early Homo Sapiens, to
Homo Sapiens Sapiens — our evolution has been driven at a frenzied pace in that
enduring cauldron, by endless cycles of drought and rain South of the Sahara,
constantly, relentlessly, more rapidly here than anywhere else. During the infrequent
and short interglacial periods, and during the transitions to the glacial periods, there
were minor insertions of currently progressive humanity into Northern Africa, and
beginning with Homo Erectus, some of these bands migrated into the Near East
each time an insertion occurred. By the nature of the process, the new arrivals were
always in a more advanced state than the populations they encountered.
Naturally, these expansions tended to be channeled along routes where the
going was easy, across plains and along streams between mountain ranges. From
Northeast Africa as the major exit, the first accessible region was the Near East —
Arabia, Palestine, Mesopotamia, and Iran. These served as secondary sources of
3.3. The Pre-Neolithic Background 147
major importance, repeatedly introducing new populations and their languages in a
fan-like pattern into Europe, Siberia, India, China, and Southeast Asia, with
occasionally a minor reflux of bands back into Africa. Northward penetrations by
Homo Sapiens Sapiens, however, were long delayed — perhaps as much as 50,000
years — since it was difficult to adapt to the cold of the Ice Age. Once these
penetrations succeeded, however, these outer territories, in turn, served as tertiary
centers of expansion. Europe, in particular, was the primary source of Indo-
European expansions at a much later time.
Another tertiary (and late) center of major strategic importance was Northeast
Siberia, which intermittently introduced bands and their associated languages into the
New World. To judge from the distribution of languages there, the chronological
order was first Amerindian, then Na-Dene, and finally Eskimo-Aleut. The
Amerindians must have entered during a late phase of the most recent Ice Age via
the land bridge which then existed at the Bering Strait, and the Na-Dene speakers
also may have used that corridor, but at a later time. The Eskimo-Aleuts, on the
other hand, entered after the corridor had been inundated as a consequence of rising
sea levels due to the melting of ice during the recession of the most recent Ice Age.
They apparently island-hopped along the Aleutians, then rounded Alaska and went
Eastward through Northern Canada to Greenland, proceeding mostly by water and
settling the adjacent shores and nearby territories.
It should be realized that the opposition by the earlier inhabitants of a given
territory need not have been a major impediment to penetration by outsiders during
this pre-agricultural period. Population densities were small by later standards, and
these hunter-gatherer groups were impelled to migrate over ranges of many
kilometers in order to maintain their food supplies, so it must have been common
for bands to penetrate each other's territories, the stronger bands tending to expel or
absorb the weaker when confrontations occurred. Even for Late Neolithic times in
Europe (3000 to 2000 BCE), when the population density was much higher, there is
much archaeological evidence of cultural interpénétration. Since the identity of a
language is a cultural phenomenon, it is likely that many of the earlier tribal
languages became extinct through linguistic replacement or were relegated to relict
areas. And those that did not must have borrowed many words and occasionally
even grammatical expressions, mostly unbound.
The borrowing of pronominal affixes, however, must have been exceedingly
rare since it has seldom been observed except where the circumstances have been
unusual indeed. For this reason, a sharing of several pronominal affixes (and often
demonstrative roots) can be of value in showing a genetic relationship between
languages in the relative absence of other indications. This is the case, for example,
in relating Indo-European to the other families distributed along the Northern parts
of Eurasia and North America (J. C. Kerns 1985:11-21 and 31-50).
148 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
We can now consider some of the probable linguistic implications of the
foregoing phenomena.
No one knows when human language began, but there is reason to suspect that
its development was not a sudden event. The very fact that we are strongly inclined
to think in verbal terms and that it is almost impossible to prevent a child from
learning a language, and that a child generally has an effective command of its
language by the age of three or four, suggests that the urge to speak and understand
is genetically driven and dates from an early stage of our special evolution, perhaps
Homo Erectus. After all, the need for better communication was urgent from the
very beginning because of the exceptionally stringent selection process that was
constantly operating in Africa.
Also, the apparent fact that a fully human vocal apparatus seems not to have
evolved until the advent of Homo Sapiens suggests that the development of a
wholly evolved linguistic capability was not a revolutionary event, but rather the
product of a gradual though powerfully driven evolution dating from the beginning
of early Homo Sapiens in Southern Africa, perhaps some 180,000 years ago. If this
is so, the languages we observe today must be the result of innumerable and mostly
independent linguistic transformations.
At first sight, this might suggest that it would be unlikely that there could be
any resemblance between languages spoken in widely separated parts of the world
today, but there are several factors that militate against this conclusion. One is the
so-called "Founder's Effect", a phenomenon observed in both biology and linguistics.
In biology it gives rise to Adaptive Radiation, and in linguistics to the Family
Tree model of linguistic differentiation.
Implicit in this is a process of unconscious selection, or sampling, that occurs
whenever a group of people migrates to a new territory, carrying their language,
customs and technologies with them and adapting them to new situations. It usually
happens that their language is a member of a linguistic family whose territory
includes their old home, and when these people migrate, only a few closely related
dialects of a single language of that family are transferred to the new territory —
thus the selection. If the communications with the old territory become sufficiently
attenuated, the new language itself may become ancestral to new dialects and these
in turn may differentiate into a new family of mutually unintelligible but closely
related languages; the historically observable branches of IE-Proper provide several
examples of this. The important point is that the indications of relationship are
more obvious and numerous in the younger families.
A second factor is the tendency for the new languages to replace the older
languages in the territories being penetrated. This is because the immigrants usually
have some advantageous characteristic or technique that enabled them to make their
3.3. The Pre-Neolithic Background 149
penetration in the first place; in many cases, however, the replacement may require
several centuries for its completion. Meanwhile, a great deal of genetic mixing
usually occurs, and since the disappearance of Homo Eree tus and Homo Sapiens
Νeanderthalensis, the mixing has been going on at such a rapid pace that the
integrity of Homo Sapiens as a single species has never been broken. This
illustrates the increasing importance of culture as a vehicle of human evolution: The
replacements occur more in the languages than in the populations themselves.
A third factor, related to the Founder's Effect, is what may be called a
focal expansion, a phenomenon that is known to have occurred several times in
history and can be inferred for prehistoric instances as well; the analogy is to the
focus of a searchlight as a radiative source. In a focal expansion, the advantage
enjoyed by the invading tribes is so great that they are able to penetrate and
dominate an area that is many times greater than their original territory. In many
cases this penetration can be accomplished so swiftly — in perhaps a few centuries —
that an essentially undifferentiated language is placed in a dominating position over
the entire area. If this dominance is maintained long enough, the local languages
tend gradually to die out; historically known instances are the Celtic languages in
Western Europe, the Uralic languages in the former Soviet Union, and the
Amerindian languages in the New World. In the case of Celtic, the dominating
languages have been Latin in Gaul, Germanic dialects in the Netherlands and
Southern Germany, and English in the British Isles. In the meantime, of course, a
dominating language will itself be breaking up into dialects which themselves may
become new languages, thus giving birth to a new linguistic family in a relatively
pure example of the Family Tree model; however, this differentiation can be
slowed or even reversed during periods of enhanced communications., as in the
present era.
An alternative to the Family Tree model is Schmidt's Wave Theory, which
deals with a different aspect of linguistic change. This model describes a process of
convergence that may become prominent during the several centuries, or even
millennia, following the initial spread of a single language in a focal expansion. The
classic example is Schmidt's (1872) original description of special resemblances
between adjacent branches of IE-Proper, obscured (but not eliminated) by later
expansions from the general region of Central Europe as a diffuse center.
Examples of focal expansions are known from both history and prehistory.
A well-known example from history is the establishment and subsequent
development of the Romance family. In this family, Sardinian (Logudonan dialect),
Rumanian, and especially French, show aberrant characteristics (for different
reasons). Yet when we trace the written forms of the Romance languages back into
the Middle Ages, we see them converging toward a common type, increasingly
resembling what is thought to have been the Vulgar Latin of about 200 BCE, about
150 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
the time of the Punic Wars when Rome was beginning its imperial expansion in
earnest. Of course, Vulgar Latin was not quite the same as the Classical Latin of
Caesar or Cicero, for the latter was a written form and hence somewhat artificial.
The important point is that, from history, we know that the ancestral form of
these languages emanated ultimately from a small district on the lower Tiber, and
that it was imparted to its historically known European territories during the course
of a few centuries, a period sufficiently short that there was not time enough for it
to change much. The result was that an essentially undifferentiated language was
rather suddenly spread from a narrowly restricted area over a much larger territory,
thus presenting a typical example of a focal expansion.
The originally unified Latin then differentiated into closely related dialects,
and these eventually into mutually unintelligible languages evolving in such a way
that each most closely resembled its nearest neighbors, thus exemplifying Schmidt's
Wave Theory in a process of convergence due to extensive borrowing between
adjacent dialects. Such a pattern will persist until it is overlaid by later expansions.
Focal expansions have been surprisingly frequent in history, being especially
prominent during the past 2000 years, for which historical records are comparatively
abundant. In addition to the Romance example, we have the spread of closely
related ζ-Turkic languages through Central and Western Asia, Arabic through most
of the lands bordering the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, and such modern
colonial expansions as Portuguese, Spanish, French, English, and Great Russian (into
Siberia). In each case, we have the relatively sudden imposition of an essentially
unified language over a territory which is much larger than that originally occupied.
It is reasonable to suspect that focal expansions occurred also in prehistoric
times, although their critical events are hidden from us by the general lack of
historical information. A good example would be the Linear Pottery expansion
from its original restricted territory near the upper bend of the Danube in Hungary,
which very probably transferred the essentially undivided IE-Proper dialect of
Indo-European, along with its special version of a Neolithic culture, in a swift
expansion into most of Northern Europe from the Netherlands to the Western
Ukraine, from about 5200 to 4800 BCE. This accounts for the essential unity that
characterizes the IE-Proper branches, despite their variegated appearance in historical
times due to the early date of this expansion.
A surprising feature of the Linear Pottery culture, which archaeologists have
often noted, is the remarkable uniformity of the stylistic characteristics exhibited in
its settlements — of course this implies that the expansion originated in a narrowly
restricted territory, else this uniformity would have been impossible. Since the
identity of a language or dialect is a cultural phenomenon, it is reasonable to suggest
that the language of the bearers of that culture was similarly highly unified. This is
in harmony with the view that this was a classic example of a focal expansion.
3.3. The Pre-Neolithic Background 151
With the foregoing description of processes as background, we can now
speculate with greater realism concerning the linguistic developments in the regions,
and during the periods, in question. Since my interest is mainly in Nostratic, little
attention will be paid to other phyla despite their obvious importance to our
understanding of the linguistic distributions on this planet.
The last interglacial preceding this one is thought to have lasted between about
130,000 and 100,000 years ago, so it was probably during this period that Homo
Sapiens Sapiens was first introduced via that narrow nexus, the Sinai Peninsula,
into the enormous second Eden outside Africa. By this time, human languages, as
we envision them, had probably been spoken for several tens of thousands of years
in sub-Saharan Africa, and several selection processes had already been imposed
upon them.
First of all, the migratory habits of humans on the African savanna,
necessitated by their conditions of life as hunter-gatherers in that region with its
endless alternations of drought and rain, were themselves conducive to the swift
expansion of tribes and their languages at the expense of the languages of less
mobile populations. This must have resulted in repeated extinctions of earlier
languages and their replacement by new widely-spread linguistic families. By the
nature of the process, each of the new families was itself the outgrowth of an older
language in some specific restricted locality within the same general region, so that
at any one time a survey of the linguistic panorama would have presented a picture
of a few widely spread families of recent origin pressing against a number of more
distantly related languages in relict areas. This is not unlike the picture that we
have of Amerindian families in the New World, where extensive recent expansions
such as the Algonquian exist at the expense of more distantly related relics of older
expansions. It is also similar to the picture that has emerged in Eurasia.
A second process of selection occurred in the drift of populations from the
Sahara Northward to the Mediterranean region.
A third selection occurred when tribes wandered across the Sinai Peninsula
into the outer world, particularly during the pre-Würm interglacial just mentioned,
and during the onset of the glaciation itself. Since this corridor seems to have been
the only available egress from Africa, it seems reasonable to suggest that all the
dialects exported from Africa during this period were genetically related, particularly
in view of the sequential character of the previous two selections.
This was 100,000 years ago, however, and as the populations fanned out from
the Near East there has been ample time for their languages to differentiate almost
beyond recognition, both in various centers in the Near East and in other centers
farther out. Were it not for the processes of linguistic spreading and convergence
above described, we would not expect to notice resemblances between languages in
152 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
distantly separated regions. And in fact, the languages of Aboriginal Australia and
Papua are difficult to relate to those of the Austro-Tai phylum, not to mention
Dene-Caucasian, Nostratic, and Amerindian. Aboriginal Australian, in particular, is
believed to represent a separation of some 40,000 years.
For Amerindian, however, the situation seems less extreme. Archaeologists in
the New World have had difficulty in demonstrating, beyond cavil, a human
presence earlier than some 15,000 years ago. Pending new discoveries and
subsequent verification, I shall adhere to their consensus. If it is correct, it lends
credence to the proposition that the Amerindian languages (i.e., those arising from
origins other than Na-Dene or Eskimo-Aleut) do indeed belong to a single linguistic
phylum reflecting a unique immigration roughly 15,000 years ago, and corres-
pondingly a relatively recent arrival of Homo Sapiens Sapiens in Northeastern
Asia.
The Amerindians evidently originated in Eastern Siberia, for they share special
racial similarities with the populations in that region today. These include relatively
coarse and mostly straight black hair on the head, a relative hairlessness of body,
and the peculiar "shovel" dentition, but not the epicanthic fold about the eyes. And
they do not include the Type Β blood that now dominates in their old Asiatic home
as well as most of the rest of Asia, including India, and also much of Europe; this
dominance seems to represent a late evolutionary trend in Eurasia, overriding the
more apparent racial differences such as Caucasian versus Mongoloid. It may well
have been occasioned by the spread of Nostratic-speaking populations.
This racial isolation of the Amerindians (until recently) is reflected in the
linguistic situation in Eurasia as well as the Americas. Several considerations apply,
as follows:
1. The geographical distribution of linguistic phyla in the New World suggests
that their speakers entered in the chronological order: Amerindian, Na-Dene,
Eskimo-Aleut. This is also suggested by the greater variation in Amerindian
languages versus those in the other two phyla.
2. Linguistic relics of early Amerindian in the Old World are not apparent.
3. Dene-Caucasian speakers in the Old World are restricted mainly to
mountainous regions: the Pyrenees (Basque), the Caucasus and nearby
mountainous areas (North Caucasian, Burushaski, and perhaps the now-extinct
Hattic and Hurrian in present-day Turkey), and the Tibetan plateau (Sino-
Tibetan). An apparent exception exists in Chinese, but this probably represents
a post-Nostratic expansion Northeastward from the Tibetan plateau.
3.3. The Pre-Neolithic Background 153
These considerations suggest that the above chronological order among the
three phyla pertains to the Old World as well as the New. Early Amerindian must
once have prevailed in at least the Eastern part of Siberia, but apparently has been
displaced from the Old World altogether by the two later phyla, probably mainly
Dene-Caucasian since it holds an intermediate position between Nostratic and
Amerindian in the New World. And in general, the advent of Nostratic in Eastern
Siberia and especially North America seems to be relatively recent.
If the above identification of Dene-Caucasian families is correct, there must
have been a time when these languages dominated Eurasia from the Pyrenees to the
Bering Strait and eventually beyond into North America. Apparently this was in a
late phase of the Upper Paleolithic during the last part of the Würm glaciation, a
few millennia before the onset of the present interglacial. This enormous extension
of a single linguistic phylum ought not be a matter for surprise; it is the natural
result of the intensely mobile activities of hunter-gatherers of the highly evolved
Aurignacian and successor cultures, which had originated in the Near East and by
this time had been brought to a peak of adaptability and penetrating power in their
conquest of sub-Arctic environments. In fact, by this time, the leadership in
intellectual etherealization may well have passed from Africa to Eurasia.
I believe that Nostratic languages did not exist except as a part of Dene-
Caucasian until the waning of the Würm glaciation, some 15,000 years ago. At this
time the glacial ice began a rapid retreat all along the Northern fringe of Eurasia.
In Europe, the effect was particularly dramatic, where the ice had been piled to
impressive heights with moisture received from the Atlantic. Huge lakes developed
from the melt water, particularly in the lowlands of Southern Russia, and new rivers
were eroded into being, to both feed and drain the lakes, and to drain the Northern
slopes of Eurasia as they came into view. As the new lands emerged, sub-Acrtic
winds whipped up the dust of rocks, which had been ground by the movements of
glacial ice, and carried it Southward into the newly emerging forests. Most of the
dust was deposited in the valleys near rivers, forming the basis of the fertile loess
soils that later proved so attractive to early Neolithic farmers with their techniques
of slash and burn and their casual herding of domesticated animals. These people
included the Chinese in Asia, and also the Indo-Europeans in the Balkans and later
in Central Europe with the Linear Pottery expansion around 5000 BCE, and in the
lands radiating Northward and Eastward from there.
By 10,000 BCE, the Northern half of Eurasia and North America had been
transformed. Formerly glacial and sub-Arctic lands were now temperate forests;
only the Circumpolar fringe was still Arctic or sub-Arctic. The great herds of large
Arctic mammals had been replaced by more solitary game, and fish abounded in the
lakes and streams. People of (ultimately) Aurignacian ancestry adapted their
equipment and techniques to take advantage of the new opportunities. The
154 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
small-blade stone working of the Aurignacians and their successors was refined and
elaborated to provide a varied array of new tools and weapons by setting these
"microliths" in handles of wood or antler. Greater use was made of bows and
arrows (with microlith tips), and dogs were used in the hunt and for food. Fishing
industries were established in the rivers and lakes, and particularly in the Baltic,
involving nets, boats and bait lines.
As always in hunter-gatherer societies, mobility was at a premium. Canoes
were used for water travel and snow shoes and sleds were developed for overland
travel in winter. The conditions were favorable for the rapid spread of tribes and
their new linguistic family over immense distances. This expansion, which is called
Mesolithic, is indicated archaeologically by microliths found all along Northern
Eurasia and Southward through the Caucasus into the Near East, where it later
developed smoothly into the Neolithic with its domestication of cereals and of
animals suitable for food and fibers.
The Mesolithic culture is aptly named, for it provided a gradual though rapid
transition between the Upper Paleolithic and the agricultural Neolithic. There was,
in fact, a steady advance in man's ability to control and exploit his environment.
This point is brought out by Grahame Clark (1980).
The more I study the matter, the more I am convinced that the spread of the
Nostratic speaking peoples was occasioned by the spread of the Mesolithic culture,
for it occupied the right positions in time and space, and its characteristic features
are compatible with the residual vocabulary of the Nostratic families — it was the
last of the pre-agricultural eras in Eurasia.
Was the culture unilingual? I believe it was, in origin, though by the time the
culture had spread into the more extreme areas — North Africa and Eastern Eurasia
and North America — it had broken up into a catenation of mutually unintelligible,
though closely related, languages, some of which eventually became ancestral to new
linguistic families, including those comprising the Northern Nostratic sub-phylum we
observe today. One reason for assuming a unitary origin is that certain features of
vocabulary and morphology are shared between Eskimo-Aleut and Indo-European
that occur only vestigially in the intervening families. This includes the heteroclitic
declension. It also includes a few items of shared vocabulary such as Eskimo
(Yupik) alia 'other' and ingne 'fire' (with a velar nasal in the first syllable). The
paucity of such correspondences is analogous to the vestigial retention of radioactive
atoms after the lapse of several half-lives.
Here, ingne is particularly interesting. It reminds us of Latin ignis 'fire'. The
vowel in the first syllable is controversial since the corresponding vowels in the
Lithuanian and Sanskrit words are respectively u - and α-, which cannot be
reconciled with the Latin form or with each other by the accepted rules of
phonological correspondence. This suggests that the ancestral word in Nostratic had
3.3. The Pre-Neolithic Background 155
the velar nasal in the first syllable, preserved in Yupik but perhaps lost sometime
during the prehistory of Indo-European. Bomhard informs me that some
Indo-Europeanists (cf. Ernout—Meillet 1979:308) have suggested that the Latin form
may come from an earlier *ngnis, with a syllabic nasal in the first syllable.
I believe that the Mesolithic culture, with its Nostratic language, had its
beginning in or near the Fertile Crescent just south of the Caucasus, with a slightly
later northern extension into Southern Russia in intimate association with woods and
fresh water in lakes and rivers. From these positions, it had ready access to the
lower Danube and the Balkans (Indo-European), to the Caucasus (Kartvelian), south
of the Caucasus into Mesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt, and the rest of North Africa
(Sumerian and Afroasiatic), eastward into Central Siberia (Elamo-Dravidian), and
northward and thence eastward along the Circompolar fringe (Uralic-Yukaghir,
Altaic, Chukchi-Kamchatkin, Gilyak, and Eskimo-Aleut). In the process of its
expansion, it undoubtedly effected a linguistic conversion of many tribes of
Dene-Caucasian or other origin; this accounts for the fact that non-Nostratic
languages in Eurasia in historic times have been found mostly as relics in
mountainous regions. Exceptions are Chinese and the now moribund or extinct Ket,
which, together with Hattic and Hurrian, probably represent post-Nostratic
reemergences of Dene-Caucasian speakers from their relict areas.
The Nostratic dispersion probably began at least 15,000 years ago, giving
ample time for a plethora of eccentric linguistic developments unrecorded in history.
By historic times — i.e., as late as the nineteenth century in many instances — the
primordial features have been much diluted and transformed. Only by viewing the
entire macrofamily holistically can we gain some idea of the features of the original
Nostratic language; the importance of Indo-European in this is crucial in that it
serves as an intermediate link, linguistically as well as geographically, between
Kartvelian, Sumerian, and Afroasiatic on the one hand, and the Circumpolar group
(Uralic-Yukaghir to Eskimo-Aleut) on the other. Besides, Indo-European seems to
be fairly conservative in its syntactic system, its nominal declension, its pronouns,
and its vocabulary in general.
At last we return to the issue I raised at the beginning of this section: Why
does Indo-European resemble Afroasiatic in phonology and vocabulary, but the
Circumpolar group in syntax and morphology? If the foregoing scenario is correct,
or nearly so, it suggests that the Nostratic dispersal began almost as soon as its unity
was formed; this is the inevitable result of the peripatetic activities of hunter-
gatherers in an expansive situation. If we assume that the speakers of pre-Indo-
European remained in the neighborhood of the Caucasus to a fairly late period (say
7500 BCE), with Afroasiatic already extending through Palestine into Egypt and
eventually into the rest of North Africa, but with its Semitic branch still situated in
Northern Mesopotamia high on the upper slopes of the Fertile Crescent, we would
156 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
have an explanation for the similarity of vocabulary. That this proximity existed to
a late period is suggested by shared words for field, bull, cow, sheep, and goat,
animals which were then being domesticated in the Fertile Crescent. In addition,
shared words for star and seven suggest a common veneration for that number and
perhaps a shared ideology. This is speculative, of course, but if it is true it suggests
an association that was social as well as geographical.
Meanwhile, the Circumpolar families were developing in a situation that was
geographically and environmentally separate. Here, the Mesolithic way of life has
been maintained continuously to recent times; any impulses toward agriculture have
been late, and except for the Finno-Ugrians, they all have been received from
non-Indo-European sources. The linguistic developments have been equally
idiosyncratic. In all of these families the SOV word order and associated
morphological principles of early Indo-European have been retained except where
subjected to alien influences in more recent times, and they have been maintained
with special purity in Altaic and Elamo-Dravidian, which may well have been of
Siberian origin. In vocabulary, they show little in common with Indo-European or
Afroasiatic except at a strictly pre-agricultural level.
In Uralic-Yukaghir, the linguistic idiosyncrasy is particularly marked. While
the syntax and a considerable part of the morphology are basically conservative, the
latter has been extended to an astonishing degree in several languages. But the most
striking peculiarity of this family is the remarkable simplification that has developed
in its consonantal system (reminiscent of Tocharian in Indo-European), and in the
paucity of the Nostratic vocabulary that it has retained. It suggests a long isolation
along the North Siberian fringe in the neighborhood of tribes not yet converted to
Nostratic speech, for these features are less prominent in the other families of this
group.
By the same token, it also suggests that the similarities shared by Uralic with
Indo-European, or Eskimo-Aleut are very likely to have been features of the
original Nostratic since borrowing among these groups is excluded by their mutual
isolation until much more recent times. Although the similarities are few as
discernible at this late date, they are sufficiently striking that they are unlikely to
have been due to independent developments. This principle will be invoked
repeatedly in the discussion that follows.
3.4. Morphology and Syntax
These topics are considered together here since they are inextricably linked.
Indeed, without syntax, there could be no such thing as morphology. In any
language, as new elements of morphology are developed or adopted, they are
3.4. Morphology and Syntax 157
incorporated and arranged in accordance with the rules of syntax applying in that
language at the time.
For some years now, it has been customary to classify syntactic systems in
terms of the relative positions of Subject, Verb, and Object (S, V and O), there
being six possible permutations of these three entities taken three at a time. Of
these six arrangements, three are most often observed. These are SOV, SVO and
VSO.
Of these three, the SOV pattern is characteristic of most Nostratic families as
known, or inferred, from their earliest historical remains. All the exceptions to this
rule seem to have had secondary though not entirely independent origins. For
example, the SVO pattern in modern Uralic-Yukaghir languages is restricted to
certain Finnic languages and Hungarian, where it apparently has been due to fairly
recent influences from such post-Indo-European languages as Germanic and Slavic,
that earlier had been SOV; the other Uralic-Yukaghir languages still retain the
prehistoric SOV pattern.
The only examples of the VSO pattern in Nostratic families that Ί am aware
of are in the three branches of Afroasiatic cited by Bomhard in the Introduction to
this book, namely the classical Semitic languages (except Akkadian), Berber, and
Ancient Egyptian, and in the Neo-Celtic languages in the modern Indo-European
group (Hetzron 1990).
So far as we know, the developments of these examples of the VSO pattern in
these two families were not historically connected. For instance, the syntactic
patterns of the Neo-Celtic languages are so similar to those of a classical Semitic
language that they might be thought to be due to Semitic influence. If this were so,
however, we would expect to find a number of Semitic borrowings in Neo-Celtic
lexicons, yet evidence of this seems to be lacking. On the contrary, Old Irish shows
traces of having once been a SOV language, as was true also of the other branches
of Indo-European in their early phases (W. P. Lehmann 1974).
There is also reason to suspect that the VSO pattern of classical Semitic,
Berber, and Ancient Egyptian was similarly secondary since the distribution of the
pattern in Afroasiatic, while wide-spread, is incomplete. Cushitic and Omotic, with
their SOV pattern, are notable exceptions, while Chadic is intermediate with its SVO
pattern, like most modern Indo-European languages. Another exception, unique
among the classical Semitic languages, was Akkadian, whose verb was placed at the
end; this suggests that the conversion to the VSO pattern in the other languages was
fairly late, having spread largely by convergence due to persistent migrations in
response to arid conditions. Ethiopian Semitic has secondarily adopted the Cushitic
pattern (Hetzron 1990).
This idiosyncrasy of the Cushitic and Omotic branches is significant. At first
glance, the great number of their widely differentiated languages, all confined to a
158 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
rather small territory at the Southeastern corner of the Afroasiatic speaking world,
suggests that it must have been here that the undivided Afroasiatic language had its
origin. After all, a similar argument can be used to show that Central Europe was
the primary center of post-Indo-European expansions, which I heartily endorse.
The two cases are different, however. If the Cushitic and Omotic realms were
indeed the homeland of Afroasiatic (and, by extension, of all the other families of
the Nostratic phylum), we would somehow have to account for the enormous
expansive power of its culture, extending through the Near East, the Caucasus,
Eurasia, and into Northern North America. We have no plausible mechanism to
account for such a phenomenon in terms of climate changes or archaeologically
observable advances in technology or culture in comparison with contemporary
phenomena in the Near East and nearby regions.
Furthermore, the linguistic and racial differences between the Afroasiatic
speakers (in general) and the neighboring Central African peoples are profound,
although the Cushitic, Omotic, and Chadic speakers do exhibit substantial racial
similarity to them. If the Cushitic and Omotic regions were indeed the primary
center of Afroasiatic expansion, why did not its enormous influence extend through
Central Africa into the South as the Bantus did a few thousand years ago? And why
is the linguistic difference so great? The same questions apply in regard to the
Chadic speaking region.
It appears, then, that the conventional view of the matter is correct: The
presence of Afroasiatic speakers in North Africa is due to successive waves of
expansion from the Near East, each representing a contemporary form of
post-Afroasiatic. In the earliest phase, the language may have been close to
contemporary Indo-European, having the same SOV syntactic order inherited from
Nostratic, and presumably much the same morphology, but already exhibiting the
characteristic Afroasiatic feminine in i, which seems to be peculiar to this family.
This wave, with its early Nostratic language, must have represented the first flush of
Mesolithic influence in Africa, preceding the advent of the agricultural Neolithic in
that region. It extended as far as the Ethiopian highlands and the Chad Basin to the
Northwest of them, but there bogged down after converting the local African
peoples to Nostratic speech as represented by the Cushitic, Omotic, and Chadic
speakers of today. Thus, it represents the highwater mark of Southward Afroasiatic
(and Nostratic) expansion in Africa. It is probable that the Cushitic and Omotic
languages still retain traces of early Nostratic morphology, but I personally have not
had a chance to investigate this.
Later Southward waves of Afroasiatic speakers occurred at times when the old
SOV pattern had changed — or was in process of changing — to the historically
observed VSO pattern, accounting for the Berber and Old Egyptian speakers, the
Semites of Syria, Palestine, Arabia, and Ethiopia, and eventually the Arabic
3.4.1. Elementary Syntax 159
expansions of the present era. The Semitic expansions seem to have been relatively
late since their languages are less diverse than in the other branches. This is in
harmony with the suggestion, expressed in the previous section, that the early
Indo-Europeans and Semites were neighbors in or near the Caucasus at a fairly late
period.
Thus, the diversity of the Cushitic and Omotic languages is not due to their
speakers' occupying the original homeland of Afroasiatic expansion, but simply to
the fact that these languages represent remnants of early Afroasiatic extended to its
Southernmost extreme and evolving in relative isolation from currents of change in
the major part of the Afroasiatic speaking world. There is a parallel situation in
Northeastern Siberia, where such highly differentiated languages as Gilyak and
Chukchi have evolved in isolation from their relatives in the rest of Sitiería. Were
it not for the relatively late expansion of the Eskimo-Aleuts, these languages would
represent the Northeastern extreme of Nostratic expansion.
There seems to be a legitimate question as to whether Afroasiatic should be
regarded as a full-fledged member of Nostratic. While it is undoubtedly closely
related to it, especially to Indo-European, it has some features that seem to be
peculiar and ancient. These include the feminine in t, the second-person pronominal
affix k, and perhaps the prefix conjugation of the verb. It may be that Afroasiatic
represents a transitional form between a local (Caucasie) version of Dene-Caucasian
and the rest of Nostratic, properly speaking. In this sense, Afroasiatic could indeed
be the "oldest" of the Nostratic families, as Bomhard suggests in the Introduction to
this book.
It is noteworthy that the Southward expansions of the Afroasiatic speakers
represent a reversal of the tides of migration out of Africa that seem to have
occurred during previous interglacial periods, notably the pre-Wiirm interglacial
some 120,000 years ago. It confirms that the suggestion made in the preceding
section, that the leadership in intellectual etherealization had passed from Africa to
Eurasia during the Aurignacian and Gravettian periods, may indeed be correct.
In view of the foregoing considerations, I conclude that the syntactic structure
of the simple sentence in the earliest Nostratic, and probably much of the ancestral
Dene-Caucasian as well, was undoubtedly SOV.
3.4.1. Elementary Syntax
In his 1974 book Proto-Indo-European Syntax, W. P. Lehmann mostly
ignores the position and function of the Subject, treating the matter only in terms of
the relative positions of Verb and Object (if present). I approve of this since the
Subject is often referred to only obliquely or parenthetically, and sometimes omitted
160 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
altogether. On page 12, he says (here adapted for clarification):
By this principle, noun objects are placed either before or after verbs. If
objects are placed before verbs, the verb is followed by the categorial
markers for qualifiers. If objects are placed after verbs, the Q (qualifying)
categorial markers precede the verbs. Further, nominal modifiers (i.e., entities
that modify nouns) are placed on the opposite side of nouns from that on
which verbs stand with regard to their objects. This principle brings
about the distinguishing characteristics of verb-object (VO) and
object-verb (OV) languages (my emphases and mostly my parentheses).
As with any feature or characteristic of language, the features of the
language governed by the principle may be undergoing change. When they
are, the language in question is not a consistent language, though it may be
predominantly VO or OV.
It seems to me that Lehmann misses the point. Although his observational
statements are correct, the principle he enunciates confuses cause and effect. As I
see it, the governing principle is not the relative positions of verb and object (if
any), but rather the principle of subordination (or its converse, superordination); if
this principle is allowed to operate consistently, the phenomena he describes (among
others) will be produced automatically.
In a sense, the term "subordination" (or its adjectival form, "subordinate") is
inappropriate. It stems from the old habit of referring to a so-called subordinate
clause as "subordinate" to the main clause of a sentence, when actually it is in a
governing situation because of its function of limiting the application of the main
clause, making it more specific. In a similar manner, it is inappropriate to refer to
the noun as the "head" of an adjective-noun combination. Nevertheless, these terms
are so deeply ingrained in grammatical parlance that I shall continue to use them in
the conventional way. Alternatively, we can use the terms Modifier and Modified
(or Qualifier and Qualified) for the so-called "subordinate" and "head" elements,
respectively. The Modifier and the Modified may be grammatical affixes,
individual words, phrases, or entire clauses, depending on circumstances.
The matter can be seen more clearly in terms of elementary Set Theory, or the
algebra of classes. In a language like English, where a noun is usually preceded by
its associated attributive adjective, a phrase such as "black cat" represents a rather
limited set composed of elements that are simultaneously cats and black in color;
this is a new set that has been formed by the intersection of two larger sets: One
composed of all the elements that are black in color, and the other of all the
elements that are cats. Intersection always produces a more limited set than either
of the two contributory sets unless they are identical at the start or if one is a subset
3.4.2. SOV Grammatical Development 161
of the other. The particular cat in question is selected from the reduced set thus
defined.
In actual speech (and listening), a psychological hierarchy exists in that the
distinguishing quality represented by one of the sets is felt to take precedence over
that of the other, i.e., to "modify" or "qualify" it. In the above case, the quality of
blackness is felt to modify, or limit, the permissible selection of cats. Thus, an
attributive adjective modifies its associated noun.
In an SOV language, a modifying entity, when unmarked, normally precedes
the entity it modifies, while in a VSO language the order is reversed. Thus, in a
consistent SOV language, an attributive adjective or a genitive precedes its "head"
noun, an adverb precedes its adjective or verb, a noun precedes its case ending or
postposition, an object precedes its verb, a verb precedes its auxiliary signs, and a
dependent "clause" is actually a participial phrase that modifies and therefore
precedes its referent noun, which in turn modifies and precedes the object-verb
combination in the main clause. Accordingly, the main verb goes at the end of the
sentence if unmarked. Here the "verb" is actually a verb-phrase consisting of the
verbal root followed by its auxiliary signs; thus, the auxiliary signs are superordinate
with respect to the verbal root. Indeed, the entire sentence can be regarded as a
catenation of words, or word-phrases, arranged in successive superordination in
progressively decreasing specification, and the word-phrases themselves are
composed in accordance with the same principle. The subject and the main verb,
when unmarked, are at opposite poles of the overall hierarchy.
3.4.2. SOV Grammatical Development
The subordination exhibited by an attributive adjective, a genitive, or an
adverb is explicit enough that it needs little further explanation. A genitive,
however, may be either a single word or a word-phrase in origin, depending on
whether it is definite or indefinite. If it is indefinite, it need not have a case ending
and thus consists of a single word in its absolutive (unsuffixed) form, but if it is
definite, it normally has a suffix expressing the subordination explicitly. In origin,
the suffix itself was once a deictic element, which earlier may have been an abstract
noun expressing the subordination.
Examples can be found even in English. The phrase "horse rider" means a
person who is capable of riding any horse within some range of acceptable types;
here "horse" is an indefinite genitive. On the other hand, the phrase "horse's rider"
means a person who normally rides a specific horse; in this case, the genitive
relationship is definite, and the word bears the genitive suffix (even if preceded by
the indefinite article). Though English is now a VO language, it still retains some
162 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
features reminiscent of its prehistoric SOV origin.
Case systems arise spontaneously in SOV languages. In origin, a noun in an
oblique case is actually a phrase consisting of the base noun modifying an abstract
noun, of more general meaning, which expresses the nature of the relationship of the
base noun to the rest of the clause; the base noun therefore precedes its case sign.
Postpositions are much the same as case endings but are less closely bound because
they are less frequently used; in course of time, they may become incorporated more
intimately into the system, which sometimes results in such enormous declensions as
those exhibited by Finnish and Hungarian. Some of this can be seen in IE-Proper,
where the postpositional origin of such endings as and * - ö 7 1 s is
apparent. Viewed synchronically, an SOV language characteristically exhibits a
tightly bound set of half a dozen "grammatical cases" of ancient origin, often
phonetically eroded by time, supplemented by perhaps a dozen postpositions that
tend to be less closely bound.
In a consistent SOV language, an object limits (modifies) its verb and therefore
precedes it. And since the verb is the least subordinate entity in the sentence, it
normally appears at the end. Here the "verb" is usually a verb-phrase consisting of
the verbal root followed by its auxiliary (mode or aspect) signs in superordination.
In origin, the auxiliary signs are abstract nouns of more general meaning than that
of the verbal root; the verbal root modifies them and therefore precedes them.
Thus, they are superordinate with respect to the verbal root.
The preverbs in Indo-European languages developed in accordance with the
same principle. They are adverbs, originally separable, that modify their associated
verbs and are so closely bound to them that each combination comprises a single
prosodie group; this is why preverbs are prefixes instead of suffixes (which we
normally expect in SOV languages). Examples in English are "overwhelm" and
"undergo"; here, English retains its old SOV pattern. Preverbs are more prevalent in
the other Germanic languages, not to mention the familiar classical Indo-European
languages.
In origin at least, verbs are actually either gerunds (verbal nouns) or participles
(verbal adjectives). This may seem strange to those of us who are accustomed to the
usual grammatical treatment of verbs in Indo-European languages, where verbs are
considered separately because of their distinctive terminations and applications. But
after all, what is a verb? When I was in grammar school, a verb was defined as "a
word that asserts action or a state of being". Gerunds and participles most certainly
fit this definition. In fact, as new modes or tenses are developed, they are usually
appended to participles; in a consistent SOV language, they are new suffixes.
Syntactically, gerunds and participles are converted into verbs by placing them in
the predicate position at the end of the clause and are usually further suffixed by
auxilliary and pronominal signs.
3.4.2. SOV Grammatical Development 163
A good example of this is the Slavic preterite in -/-, which was coming into
increasing use at the time of Old Church Slavonic. It was an adjectival suffix
attached to verbal roots to convert them to preterite active participles. These were
given a verbal force by adding the copula in close prosodie association, yet they
continued to be declined in agreement with the subject in gender, number, and
(nominative) case. Later, the root of the copula tended to become phonetically
eroded, fusing the verbal terminations firmly to the participial base in a single word.
Nevertheless, they continued to be declined as before, as in Polish today. In
Russian, however, there has been a general tendency to omit the copula, so that the
verbal terminations are missing from these forms altogether. The result is that the
declined participial endings stand naked to the world, proclaiming their origin
unmistakably.
Another obvious example is the development of the "progressive tenses" in
Modern English to express the continuative aspect. Here, however, the copula
precedes the participle, thus departing from the SOV pattern. Some of this occurred
in Gothic, but here it .was restricted to the preterite.
It is noteworthy that, in all the historically known Indo-Europear languages,
the inherited conjugations show no hint of gender distinctions. This is one of
several indications that the undivided language had no gender in the usual sense,
though it did have a minor distinction between animate and inanimate.
Like case systems, ergativity tends to develop spontaneously in SOV languages,
though far less often. Indeed, there appears to be no indication that the
manifestations of ergativity in the individual Nostratic languages are historically
connected since the relevant forms are generally different in the various languages
that have been observed to exhibit this feature. Several families, such as
Uralic-Yukaghir, Altaic, and Dravidian, give little indication of ever having been
ergative at all. Even in Indo-European, which possibly shows some indication of
once having been ergative, the manifestations are few and mild in their implications.
A convenient collection of discussions of ergativity, presented by 29
contributors, may be found in a book edited by Frans Plank (1979). The article by
Trask (1979:385—404) is particularly relevant and informative. He divides ergative
systems into two separate Types (A and B), differentiated both by their mani-
festations and their implied origins, though he recognizes that the difference is not
always clear-cut. Concerning ergative languages of Type A, he says:
If there is verbal agreement, the verb agrees with the direct object in person
and number in exactly the same way it agrees with the subject of an
intransitive verb. The verb agrees with the transitive subject in a different way.
The ergative is used equally in all tenses and aspects.
There is often an NP split, which is always in accord with Silverstein's
164 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
hierarchy; that is, the ergative is used either (a) when the subject is below
some cut-off point in the hierarchy, or (b) when the subject is below the object
in rank.
And on languages of Type Β he says:
If there is verbal agreement, the verb may agree with the direct object in
number (and in gender languages, in gender) but not in person. Subject
agreement, if present, is identical with that in intransitive verbs.
There is most often a tense/aspect split, in which case the ergative
configuration is confined to the perfective aspect or the past tense, the
accusative configuration being used elsewhere. If there is no tense/aspect split,
the ergative construction contrasts in meaning with an accusative construction.
There is usually no NP split, but if there is, it is not in accord with
Silverstein's hierarchy.
The reference is to Silverstein (1974). Trask continues:
Type A languages include Basque, the ergative languages of Australia,
most of those of North America (except Eskimo-Aleut), Tibeto-Burman
languages (except Tibetan), Chukchee, Hurrian, Sumerian and perhaps
Burushaski.
Type Β languages include the Indo-Aryan ergative languages, Kurdish,
Old Persian, Old Armenian, Tibetan, Eskimo-Aleut, the ergative languages of
Polynesia, the South Caucasian languages, and probably the North Caucasian
languages.
According to Trask, Type A ergativity tends to develop only in languages
where a passive construction is obligatory for agents of low rank (per Silverstein's
hierarchy). The ranking is generally as follows: First and second person pronouns >
third person pronouns > animate nouns > inanimate nouns.
On the other hand, Type Β ergativity tends to arise only in languages where
an equivalent for the verb 'to have' is lacking, which seems to be the case in the
majority of SOV languages. In these languages, possession is usually expressed by
putting the "owner" into an oblique case such as dative or genitive, with a copula
either expressed or implied in order to express the meaning 'to have'. Type Β
ergativity develops as a result of incorporating a nominalized deverbal form, with
stative force, into the verbal conjugation to express a state of being that had resulted
from the implied verbal action; this generally implies the perfective aspect, which in
turn often comes to express the preterite tense. This incorporation eventually
5.5. Nostratic Grammar 165
requires an agent that is felt to "own" the implied state and is, accordingly, put in an
oblique case such as genitive, dative, or locative, cases which are widely used to
express possession. This is particularly explicit in Eskimo-Aleut, where che ergative
ending (-m) is identical to that of the so-called "relative case" that is used to express
subordination in general and possession in particular.
It is interesting that Trask assigns Tibetan to Type Β yet the remaining
Tibeto-Burman languages to Type A, and, within Nostratic, he likewise assigns
Eskimo-Aleut to Type Β yet the relatively closely related Chukchi to Type A. Such
developments of ergativity of contrasting types (and implied origins), in compara-
tively recently differentiated languages, is clear indication of the secondary character
of these phenomena in the languages concerned. Indeed, the late development of
ergativity in Indo-Aryan is historically attested.
I regard Trask's treatment of the matter as seminal.
I conclude from this discussion that ergativity in most SOV languages, and
early Nostratic languages in particular, is a matter of secondary importance.
In summary, it is characteristic of SOV languages that they consist of sentences
whose internal parts have been developed and arranged in accordance with the
principle that a modifying entity precedes the entity it modifies; the SOV
arrangement follows automatically from this principle. These languages tend to be
polysyllabic since, except for particles, most of the individual words themselves were
originally word-phrases composed in accordance with the same principle.
Accordingly, they tend to be suffixing languages.
3.5. Nostratic Grammar
The above title is somewhat pretentious in that it suggests that we know
something substantial about this topic. Actually, we know very little since too few
scholars have applied sustained attention to the matter. Also, we have little solid
information to rely on because of the general lack of historically preserved
phenomena that would pertain to the prehistoric era in question. As stated above,
our only recourse is to view, simultaneously, as much of the Nostratic macrofamily
as we can under the present circumstances, and to focus our attention on those
phenomena that seem to be relevant and are similar in form and function in two or
more widely separated members. For the present, it happens that the most useful
members to examine are Indo-European, the Uralic branch of Uralic-Yukaghir, and
the Eskimo branch of Eskimo-Aleut, representing respectively the West, the
North-Central and the East.
166 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
Having first acknowledged that the Nostratic macrofamily exists, I shall
proceed with two assumptions, as follows:
1. That the early spread of Nostratic speech was approximately a focal
expansion.
2. That the syntactic system of early Nostratic was SOV in character, with rather
high consistency.
Here, the second assumption is based on our earlier discussion.
If the first assumption seems implausible, it should be remembered that focal
expansions have occurred several times in history and can be inferred for prehistoric
times as well, as earlier discussed. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how a family
tree model of linguistic differentiation could ever be considered appropriate without
the plausibility of the prior occurrence of one or more focal expansions, each
coinciding with the development of a node in the tree, thus producing isochronic
time depths for all the languages ultimately stemming from a given node. The
analogy to adaptive radiation in biological evolution is close and valid; both are
historical processes of evolution but in different media, the one being linguistic and
cultural, the other genetic. The main difference is that we have no clear biological
analogy for linguistic borrowing between functionally alien languages, although
modern genetic engineering is beginning to develop such an analogy to a slight
degree.
In retrospect, a focal expansion seems a sudden and inexplicable event.
Looking more closely, however, we can sometimes discern one or more phenomena
that seem plausible as causal factors, though first impressions are often deceiving.
Often, these factors work slowly over several centuries, but eventually they may
cross a critical threshold of instability to trigger a revolutionary train of events.
These events may entail the evolution of a local technology or some other cultural
feature to a critical phase, the introduction of a revolutionary economy to
neighboring areas (e.g., agriculture and minor herding, initially without horse
domestication), the development of a revolutionary form of warfare or political
structure (e.g., military empires), or the rapid expansion of an aggressive ideology
(e.g., Islam). There may be several factors operating together. Egregious individuals
have always been involved, but most of them have remained unknown to history.
Another important factor can be a major and rather swift change of climate, as
in the advent of the present interglacial period some 12,000 years ago, though
beginning its transition perhaps 3,000 years earlier. This is the factor that seems
most plausible as the triggering circumstance that favored the relatively sudden
expansion of a particular speech community, Common Nostratic, initially undivided
3.5.1. Nostratic Word Structure 167
except for variations of dialect. This is the community that happened to be in the
right place at the right time to be able to take maximum advantage of the new
opportunities for economic exploitation that had recently emerged. Their swift
expansion was favored by a temporary absence of human opposition and by the
mobility necessitated by their hunter-gatherer mode of life. Somebody had to be
first, and these were the people who happened to be there at the right time. This
sort of thing has happened repeatedly in history and prehistory. Chance has always
been a major factor in evolution, whether linguistic or biological.
3.5.1. Nostratic Word Structure
Except for particles and enclitics, the words in undivided Nostratic tended to
be polysyllabic, in keeping with the SOV character of Nostratic syntax. The
individual words had earlier been word-phrases whose component pans had been
arranged in accordance with the dominating principle of SOV syntax, whereby a
modifying element preceded the element it modified. But it is well to remember
that Common Nostratic must never be regarded as a "primitive" language in any
sense of the word. It was the temporary culmination of a particular evolutionary
line of descendant dialects that extended far back into the past in sub-Saharan
Africa, perhaps 200,000 years or more, involving continuous processes of formation,
dissolution and re-formation. Although the stems and terminations had originally
been separate words, they inevitably became phonetically reduced to the: point that
their earlier separate meanings were usually forgotten; indeed, as separate words,
they were often dropped from the language.
A relatively recent case in point is the Modern English adverbial suffix -ly, a
phonetically reduced descendant from Old English -lice, an oblique form of -lie,
where the -c originally had velar pronunciation. The word was earlier a noun with
two meanings, one concrete and the other abstract, respectively 'corpse' or 'animating
spirit' and 'mental image or similarity'. In the present case, however, the noun (or
adjective) still exists as our like, with the meaning 'similarity' (or 'similar'). But it is
also used as a verb expressing predilection and also as a preposition meaning 'similar
to', with the earlier sense 'image of. Here, we have a reapplication of the same
noun as a grammatical feature, but in later times the syntax of English had shifted
farther from SOV toward VO, so that the feature is realized as a preposition instead
of a suffix. This does not mean that prepositions were unused in Old English; they
occur even in Beowulf. Otherwise, however, the syntax in the poem was still
mostly SOV in character, though the trend toward the modern VO condition is
already clear. Throughout their observable histories, the syntax of the: Germanic
languages has been shifting away from the SOV condition, and the process is still
168 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
incomplete. These "Old" Germanic languages were far from old; they were already
well advanced toward their modern conditions.
As the suffixes accumulated at the end of Nostratic words, their individual
phonetic shapes tended to be simplified to a combination of a single consonant
followed by a vowel, and at the end of a word the vowel was sometimes dropped.
Consonantal combinations were not altogether excluded, however, since they were
sometimes produced by the elision of intervening vowels. Thus, the combination
*-ntfh]- became morphemically significant in expressing the continuative aspect,
without regard to voice, and this is the situation preserved in Uralic languages. It
was generally passive in the Anatolian branch of Indo-European, but in IE-Proper,
it came to be restricted to the active voice except perhaps in the Greek aorist
passive participle, where the continuative aspect was abandoned — if, indeed, this
phenomenon was historically related, which I doubt. This illustrates the secondary
significance of voice in Indo-European and its relative unimportance in the ancestral
Nostratic. Eventually, it became standard practice to bypass the process of phonetic
reduction by forming new suffixes from almost any phoneme, including vowels;
their specific morphemic functions gradually became established by social custom.
This practice was probably of pre-Nostratic origin. Nevertheless, the suffixation of
separate words continued to some degree, and it became quite active in various
post-Nostratic languages as old formations withered away and were replaced by new.
The result of this process was that a word typically consisted of a catenation of
consonants, mostly separated by vowels as convenient for pronunciation. In keeping
with the SOV syntactic principle, the root meaning was expressed by the first
syllable, often enlarged into two, three or even more syllables, by incorporating
adjacent suffixes, as the need for the expression of variant meanings came to be felt.
In some families, the number of consonants in a root tended to become standardized
to a specific number, as in the tri-consonantal system in the Semitic branch of
Afroasiatic. This was a relic of the earlier SOV syntax of this family.
The process is well described in several books which I consider especially
helpful. One is by Thomas Burrow (1959), the others by Björn Collinder (1934,
1957, 1960, 1964). Burrow's book is concerned mostly with Sanskrit and its
relationship to the rest of Indo-European. Collinder's 1957 book is a survey of
Uralic languages with sample declensional and conjugational paradigms and
annotated texts. His 1934 publication deals directly with the Indo-Uralic question
and was reprinted along with others of his, of similar interest, in his 1964 book.
His 1960 book is restricted to Uralic alone; its particular value in the present
discussion consists in the fact that it takes advantage of a more recent maturation of
Samoyedic studies to yield additional confirmation of certain Finno-Ugric
phenomena cited by him in 1934, establishing them as Pan-Uralic along with the
rest. These publications give detailed accounts of word formation in these two
3.5.1. Nostratic Word Structure 169
families, and Collinder in 1934 (and 1960) presented a number of common
formative elements — i.e., morphemic elements that were similar in sound and
function in the two families. As summarized by myself (J. C. Kerns 1985:51—64),
they include the following:
1. Nominative plural of pronouns in *-/. .
2. Oblique plural of nouns in *-/-.
3. Casus rectus (i.e., nominative-accusative) of pronouns in *-t[h¡ or *-tlh
l
+ vowel, as in our it and that. It should be noted that this phenomenon is
restricted to the neuter gender in Indo-European, implying the secondary
origin of its non-neuter genders. The precise pronunciation is problematic.
4. Oblique cases with *-n- stems. Though scantily attested in Dravidian and
Uralic (here vestigially preserved as a stem for the personal possessive endings
of nouns in oblique cases), it is better preserved in some of the other families.
It is a major feature of the heteroclitic declension in Indo-European and
Eskimo (J. C. Kerns 1985:109-111).
5. The comparative or superlative of adjectives and participles in *-m- (or
*-mp- in Uralic).
6. Verbal present stems in *-y- (or *-»-), *-n- and *-sk[h]-, with specific
functions as listed below.
7. Verbal preterite or optative stem in *-y- (or *-/-).
8. Verbal preterite stem in *-s- (palatal in Uralic).
9. Denominal and deverbal stem in *~y~, *-y or *-/-, *-i.
10. Denominal in *-klh
lk[h
l~, used to form diminutives and similar derivatives
from nouns and adjectives.
11. Denominal in *-/ or *-/-.
12. Denominal and deverbal in *-m or *-m~, occurring also in Altaic languages,
used to form gerunds, participles and infinitives. An extended form, *-men~,
is attested for Indo-European and the Finno-Ugric branch of Uralic.
170 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
13. Denominal and deverbal in *-«-.
14. Denominal and deverbal in *-nt[h
]~, forms derivative nouns and participles as
mentioned above.
15. Denominal and deverbal in *-pfi]~ or *-b[h
]~, the latter a voiced version
possibly stemming from dialectal variations in Nostratic itself, forming
derivative nouns and participles.
16. Denominal in *-r~, forming derivative nouns from simpler nouns.
17. Deverbal in *-s- or palatal *-sy~, forming abstract and agent nouns.
18. Denominal and deverbal in *-t[h]~ or *-d[h]~, the latter a voiced variant as
in 15 above.
Special verbal present extensions (Item 6 above) include the following (J. C. Kerns
1985:58, here adapted):
1. *-y~, forms new verbs of specialized meaning from other verbs, and forms
verbs from nouns and adjectives.
2. *-«-, forms inchoative verbs.
3. *-skfii~ (palatal *-syk- in Finno-Ugric), forms inchoative verbs in IE-Proper,
but frequentative verbs in Hittite and Finno-Ugric, not attested in Samoyedic.
Lack of time and space precludes a listing of supportive examples; they
abound in the cited works of Collinder. For the same reason, I cannot apply the
time and attention required to make a detailed analysis of the other Nostratic
families except to cite a few phenomena in passing. Here remains a fertile field for
future investigators.
In addition to the above phenomena, we must recognize a few others shared
between Uralic and Eskimo to the exclusion of Indo-European. These are the dual
number in *-k (correspoding to *-g or other velars in Uralic) and the plural in
*-t (the latter also in Chukchi, see Comrie—Nedjalkov in Plank 1979). In nominal
declension, the latter, at least, was probably restricted to the casus rectus as in
Finnish and (mostly) Eskimo today, though there has been a general tendency to
extend it throughout the declension secondarily. Here, the references to Eskimo are
mainly from the Yupik language described by Hinz (1944, 1955). Some objections
3.5.2. Nostratic Pronouns 171
to using an Inuit language such as Greenlandic are that the original nasals are
denasalized to their corresponding unvoiced stops when final, and -t- is. assibilated
to -s- when followed by Nevertheless, with these caveats, some reference is
also made to Fortescue's (1984) syntactic (and morphemic) description of West
Greenlandic.
I must emphasize that the above similarities between Uralic and Indo-
European, and between Uralic and Eskimo, are significant not only for a cognate
relationship between two or more of these families, but also for Nostratic as a
whole. The reason is that the paucity of common vocabulary among the undivided
families precludes any relatively recent cognate or other connection among them
save that stemming from undivided Nostratic itself, or at least its Northern branch
(including Indo-European); this is the only plausible explanation for the phenomena
we observe.
3.5.2. Nostratic Pronouns
The Nostratic families comprise the famous "miti" languages, so-called since
they seem to be unique in associating the consonants *m- and *t[h
]~ with the first
and second persons, respectively. Other characteristic pronominal features include
the use of *kw
[h]- and *m- as interrogatives and relatives, and *ya- as relative, and
such demonstrative consonantal and vocalic elements as *s~, *t[h
]~, *kih
]-, *dy~,
*n-, *?i- or *?e~, and *?a~. So characteristic are these roots that they have been
used in a statistical analysis to prove the Nostratic hypothesis, at least so far as
Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic are concerned (J. C. Kerns 1985). An explicit
comparative presentation of these roots is shown by Bomhard (1992c) in his Table 1
at the end of his recent paper "Distant Linguistic Comparison and the Nostratic
Hypothesis". In general, the personal and some demonstrative pronouns probably
were used mainly as suffixes serving as deictic elements referring mostly to the
subject, but sometimes to the object as well.
Another significant pronominal root is one restricted to the 1st person singular
— it never appears in the plural or dual except in forms that are clearly secondary.
It seems to be essentially a velar. It appears as -k in certain Uralic languages, in
the Past I conjugation of Chukchi (Comrie in Plank 1979:233), and in Eskimo with
some nasalized variants. In the last, it is restricted to absolutive paradigms,
-m- being used otherwise. For Indo-European, it is tempting to compare the 1st
singular ending of some thematic conjugations that ended in a vowel lengthened by
a laryngeal. I am unsure as to the original significance of this variation of 1st
singular forms. I suspect it has to do with the fundamental dichotomy tietween the
relative and the absolutive that underlies the SOV pattern of Nostratic grammar. It
172 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
is noteworthy that in Indo-European the nominative form of the independent
pronoun was *?ek'~ (with glottalized k), while the oblique forms used *m~,
suggesting at least a partial restriction to the absolutive as in Eskimo.
Another interesting dichotomy is that between *-m- and *-w- (or *-p-, *-b~,
*-f~, or *-v- ?) in the 1st plural (or dual) in verbal paradigms — the non-nasal
forms never appear in the singular except where obviously secondary as in Altaic
and Brythonic Neo-Celtic, where it is due to denasalization of *-m. In Eskimo, the
*-p- is restricted to absolutive paradigms, *-m- being used otherwise. In Uralic,
the *-w- distinguishes the plural from the dual in Ob-Ugric and some Samoyedic
languages; elsewhere *-m- is used. For Indo-European, the *-w- distinguishes the
dual from the plural in IE-Proper, while in Anatolian the * - w - was a general
feature of the plural except in association with the vowel -M-, when *-m- was used.
In Dravidian, only the -m- occurs, and it is at least prominent in Altaic, Chukchi,
and the Chadic branch of Afroasiatic. I suspect that the non-nasal forms arose as
mere denasalized variants of *-m- in Common Nostratic and later dialects, attaining
morphemic significance only secondarily in the daughter families.
Yet another example is a 2nd person form in *-s- which in verbal conjugation
alternates with *t[h]~ in some families, particularly Indo-European and Eskimo;
however, the *-s- is restricted mostly to the singular in Indo-European but to the
plural and dual in Eskimo. In Altaic, the *-s- or *s- was generalized in Turkic and
Tungusic for both singular and plural, while *tfi]- was generalized in Mongolian.
In Uralic, the *-f- was generalized — the -s- in Finnish is not a true exception,
being due to assibilation of original *-t- when preceding -/-. In Ob-Ugric, *~n is
used, in contrast to *-t in (Ugric) Hungarian; it also occurs in Turkic languages. In
a manner similar to the former example, the *-s- seems to be due to an assibilation
of *t[h]- dating from Nostratic times and morphemically adapted secondarily in the
daughter families.
3.5.3. Nostratic Nominal Declension
As in SOV languages generally, the nouns in Common Nostratic were declined.
Whether there was more than one nominal declension is difficult to establish, but
there is reason to think that there were at least three, which I will number
arbitrarily as follows:
1. First Declension, corresponding to the neuter heteroclitic declension in
Indo-European.
2. Second Declension, corresponding to the other neuter paradigms in Indo-
3.5.3.1. Oblique-N Stem 173
European.
3. Third Declension, a variation of the second wherein a definite-accusative
singular was marked by the termination *-m.
In the first two declensions, the accusative had no special marker, being
absolutive like the nominative as in most Indo-European neuter paradigms.
At first sight, the many "cases" exhibited by such Uralic languages as Finnish,
Hungarian, and some other Finno-Ugric languages suggest little genetic relationship
to Indo-European declensions. After a closer look, however, we realize: that much
of this is due to secondary accretions of postpositions. The Samoyedic languages are
less exuberant in this regard; in fact, both in the number of cases and the specific
terminations, their endings show considerable similarity to those of the Indo-
European consonantal declensions, appropriately the most archaic paradigms in Indo-
European. In 1934—1964, Collinder reconstructed the following singular endings as
attributable to Common Uralic:
Nominative: (endingless)
Genitive: *-n
Dative-Lative: *-nyV (palatal *-n followed by a from vowel)
Accusative: *-m
Locative: *~na
Ablative: *-ta and *-<5a
Collinder made the point that the accusative ending probably was used only
when the object was definite, and this is also the conclusion of Wickman (1955:6). I
concur in this, for it holds the key to the origin of gender in Indo-European, which
cannot be otherwise explained. I believe the above paradigm, with a few reser-
vations, is attributable to Nostratic as well as Uralic.
3.5.3.1. Oblique-TV Stem
Collinder regarded the *-n of the Uralic genitive as probably identical in
origin to the oblique-« marker mentioned under Item 4 in Section 3.5.1 above. I
fully concur in this opinion, regarding it as true beyond reasonable doubt. It
appears that there must have been a time in the early history of Nostratic when
174 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
extensive use was made of this marker to explicitly indicate relative constructions
generally. Accordingly, it would be natural to use it as a stem for case endings, and
no further ending is logically required for the genitive since its function is already
relative and needs no further marker except where it is felt that a definite-genitive
needs to be explicitly indicated as such. It is plausible to attribute this genitive
usage to Nostratic since it is shared by Altaic languages, and it also was preserved
vestigially in Etruscan, where it was mostly displaced by the obviously secondary
*-s shared with the rest of Indo-European as historically known (J. C. Kerns 1985;
Pfiffig 1969). The same genitive usage occurs in Eskimo but with special
complications to be discussed below.
This situation is also vestigially preserved in Dravidian, particularly in Tamil
and Old Kannada, two of the earliest attested and evidently the most conservative of
the historically known Dravidian languages. My reference here is to Harshe's
translation of Bloch (1954:14). The singular declensional terminations of Old
Kannada, slightly modified here, are presented as follows:
nominative: (endingless except for gender)
genitive: -a, -ina
dative: -ge, -ige
accusative: (~n)
ablative: -inde, -ind(-en)
instrumental: (-in)
Here, the forms in parentheses represent nasalization of the leading vowel,
indicated by Bloch with subpunct -m, which usually implies an -n in process of loss.
An accusative in -n is widely represented in Dravidian languages; it apparently
developed from original *-m as in other Nostratic families, particularly several
Uralic and Indo-European languages (including Etruscan). Of more immediate
interest is the occurrence of η in the genitive, the ablative, and the instrumental,
evidently a vestige of the Nostratic oblique-η stem. After commenting on this in a
rambling paragraph, Bloch continues:
In Tamil are found again these two values of -in: vètkey-in 'by desire,'
kall-in 'by wine,' muga-tt-in 'from the face,' but puRav-in allai 'the distress
of the pigeon.' In fact, if -in has a genitive value it is because it can play the
simple rôle of morpheme of oblique: tî-y-in-àl 'by the fire,' käla-in-äl 'in
time,' maratt-in uyarattei kuReikkum 'he lessens the height of the tree;' it
has to be translated as an ablative in kadal-in peridu 'great(er) than the sea.'
3.5.3.1. Oblique-N Stem 175
This proves the point, I think. I must emphasize that the only reason we have
such information is that we have the rare privilege of possessing a few relatively
early texts, and much the same must be said of Indo-European in regard to the
heteroclitic declension and the impersonal verb and even the accusative in —m. In
fact, in all the families the oblique-η phenomena have been in decline for some ten
thousand years. Not unexpectedly, the rate of decline has been slowest in the most
extreme Eastern and Western members, respectively Eskimo and Indo-European (as
Classically known).
When we look at the Uralic paradigm as reconstructed by Collinder, we see
much the same phenomena, where traces of the oblique-η were preserved in the
genitive, the dative-lative, and the locative.
We see it again in Eskimo, but with special complications. After some
rearrangement for clarity, we can list the case endings of Hinz's Yupik language as
follows:
Singular Dual or Plural
Nominative: -V, -n, -k, -q -k, -t
Relative: -m -k, -t
Dative-allative: -mun -nun
Accusative: (same as nominative)
Ablative: -mik (-mit) -nik (-nit)
Inst-sociative: -mik -nik
Locative: -mi -ni
Vialis: -kun -gun
Aequative: -tun -stun
Here we have two columns of endings, the left for the singular, the right for
the dual or plural. In the latter, we have the stem -n- corresponding to the - m - of
the singular as shown in the majority of the oblique "endings", which in. origin are
actually combinations of the true endings with the relative marker. Also, the
normally absolutive forms - k (for the dual) and - t (for the plural) of the
nominative-accusative are used for the relative as well. As stated earlier, the
relative is used also for the genitive.
Most of Fortescue's Inuit forms are similar to these except that final -m and
-n are denasalized to -p and -t respectively. In one respect, however, Iriuit is more
conservative in that the ablative is still differentiated from the instrumental-
176 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
sociative as shown by the forms in parentheses, using -mit and -nit instead of
-mik and -nik·, in Yupik, the instrumental-sociative forms are used for the ablative
as well. Such conflations have been observed in many languages, particularly where
the number of cases has been reduced.
The relative sign -m, which is used only in the singular, presents a special
problem. It seems to be unique to Eskimo-Aleut since its counterpart in all the
other families is universally -n; its secondary character is suggested also by the fact
that there are some pronouns in Eskimo where the -n is used in the singular as well
as the dual or plural. Lacking historical information, I can only guess as to the
cause of this peculiarity. I imagine that there may -have been a time in the
prehistory of this family when there was a tendency toward the loss of final
-n (restricted to the singular when final, at least in its relative function), leading to
its realization as a nasalized vowel. Later, there presumably was a reversal of this
trend, so far as the relative marker was concerned, and a reestablishment of the
nasal consonant as a bilabial; the presence of the bilabial in the singular oblique
forms of the nominal declension seems to be due to analogical extension.
There are vestigial traces of apparent oblique-« phenomena even in Japanese.
Like many others, I have mixed feelings about the primordial connections of this
language. Yet, I cannot deny that, in its syntactic features, Japanese shows strong
similarity to the more conservative Nostratic families. The morphological
resemblances are less apparent because Japanese has changed a great deal, and most
of the changes remain unrecorded, as in Nostratic families generally — its recorded
history goes back to the Nara period in the eighth century, comparable in age to
written examples of Germanic languages, which likewise were far advanced toward
their modern conditions. My own opinion is that the morphological links of
Japanese are closest to Altaic, specifically Northern Tungusic. This is not
unexpected since it puts me in the same camp as Roy Andrew Miller (1971). My
references here are to Shibatani (1990) and Bleiler (1963).
Like Classical Greek, Japanese is "loaded" with particles, used generally as
postpositions with a variety of meanings. Those with applications closest to ordinary
case endings are as follows:
Nominative: -ga, -wa
Genitive: -no
Dative-locative: -ni (motion not implied, also agent of passive verb)
Allative -e (motion implied)
Accusative: -o < -wo
Ablative -kara
Instrumental: -de (also inessive)
Sociative: -to
3.5.3.1. Oblique-N Stem 177
Ordinarily, these endings are transliterated as separate particles, but that is a
convention due to the influence of the syllabaries. Here, the genitive and the
dative-locative show the stem - η - , suggesting a vestigial retention of the
oblique-« system. These and the other endings will be discussed more fully later on.
Aside from the genitive in -n, there is little evidence of oblique-« phenomena
in the Turkic branch of Altaic; somewhat as in Uralic, it is restricted mostly to
oblique forms of the personal possessive endings of nouns, particularly the 3rd person.
In the Mongolian branch, however, the evidence is more plentiful. In most of
the declensions, the genitive ends in -n as in Turkic and Uralic languages. But
there are two principal categories of nouns with stems in -«, which F. H. Buck
(1955:35) calls "absolute-«" and "conditional-«", the latter shortened to simply
"-« stem" in his later discussion. The absolute-« nouns are a class in which the
- « is an essential part of the root. There is little that is peculiar about their
declension — the -n appears in all the cases except that the genitive is distinguished
by adding a long vowel to the -«; this seems to be unrelated to the genuine
oblique-« phenomenon.
In addition to the genitive in -«, it is the conditional-« category that seems to
be relevant to this phenomenon. At this point I will quote at length from F. H.
Buck (1955:35-36), with slight modifification:
In the written language, by the time the earliest documents make their
appearance, these declensional suffixes have already undergone a certain
amount of phonetic modification in adapting themselves to different noun
stems. These same suffixes lingered on in written language long after their
forms had undergone further modification in the spoken dialects.
As in Turkish, the plain noun stem serves as both nominative case and
indefinite case. The history of the noun stem is complicated by the fact that
the written language and modern dialects have evolved separate paradigms
with regard to a class of nouns called - n stems. Although the - « i s
historically not a part of any suffix but belongs to the noun stem, lor the sake
of contrasting the nominative case with other case forms, the - « i s included
with the case suffix in the diagram given below.
In Khalkha, if the nominative case is taken as the base, then any one of
the following suffixes may appear. A final short vowel of the nominative case
is reduced or lost before the genitive and accusative, and lost before the
ablative and instrumental. Ivi = vowel.

c
"-« stem suffixes," which appear in the genitive, dative, and ablative
cases of certain nouns whose nominative case ends in a short or long vowel.
Here, I have used "velar nasal" instead of the normal phonetic symbol. The
declensional category with Buck's "~n stem suffixes", whose nominative case ends in
a short or long vowel, is the one that directly concerns us. It seems to correspond
to the Indo-European declension that contains certain non-neuter nouns such as that
exemplified by Latin homo and Old English guma, both meaning 'man' and
mutually cognate; in this declension, the -n originally occurred in every case except
the nominative singular. There are important differences, of course; in Mongol, the
-n never extends to all the oblique cases, and the accusative and the indefinite cases,
in particular, are exempt. The significance of this will be discussed later on; the
important point here is to recognize this correspondence as a particular example of
the oblique-« phenomenon. The duplicated forms in the instrumental category in
the above paradigm may involve a misprint.
The traces of oblique-η phenomena in Indo-European are more noticeable
than in the other families because of its comparatively early records. There are two
major categories: The non-neuter homó class, mentioned above, and the neuter
heteroclitic declension. Each stems from Nostratic and the oblique-η phenomenon,
but their origins and subsequent developments in the descendant families are distinct.
It may seem odd to differentiate the two classes on the basis of gender while
insisting on their Nostratic origin, particularly since gender, in the ordinary sense,
3.5.3.2. Heteroclisis and the Impersonal Verb 179
was clearly a secondary development in Indo-European. The key to this paradox
will be discussed more fully below. For the moment, let it suffice simply to state
that it rests with the dichotomy between the particular and the general, or the
definite and the indefinite, which underlies the use of the definite-accusative and
other cases as well. So far as I know, Indo-European and the Mongolian branch of
Altaic are the only families that show distinct traces of the homö class, though I
imagine that further traces will be found in other families if the matter is diligently
pursued.
In Indo-European, the homö class is not a large one except for its secondary
expansion in the weak declension in Germanic — apart from the already cited word
for 'man', there seems to be little more than our 'ox' and 'hound'. Aside from the
reflexes in Greek and perhaps Armenian, the evidence in the other branches strongly
suggests that the nominative singular ended in a long vowel (perhaps due to a vowel
lengthening laryngeal) and did not include the -n- of the oblique forms. That the
oblique forms included the accusative in -m is due to the non-neuter character of
this class, which in turn was due to the fact that these words were used to designate
conspicuous individuals, often males, which justified the use of the definite-
accusative in *-m as inherited from Nostratic.
3.5.3.2. Heteroclisis and the Impersonal Verb
These topics are considered together here since they are directly connected.
There is general agreement that the Indo-European mediopassive in -r (or
-r~) is somehow related to the impersonal verb as vestigially preserved in
Neo-Celtic languages and the Oscan-Umbrian branch of Italic, and ths.t these are
also related to the heteroclitic declension in some unexplained way. While the
mediopassive can be plausibly explained as an analogical extension of the impersonal
verb, its detailed expression in Anatolian, Italic, Celtic, and Tocharian suggests that
its development in these branches was to a considerable degree independent. Thus,
it appears that the extension was in its early stages at the time of the IE-Proper
separation from Anatolian, which is about as early as we can go using information
from purely Indo-European sources. Because of this, and because no parallel to this
extension is apparent in the other Nostratic families, it is clear that it was a
post-Nostratic phenomenon.
With the other two phenomena, however, it is a different story. The vestigial
retention of the impersonal verb, and the fact that the heteroclitic declension was in
decline everywhere but in Anatolian, suggest that these phenomena were of pre-
Indo-European origin, perhaps going back to Nostratic itself. This is confirmed
when we examine similar formations in Eskimo-Aleut, particularly Eskimo.
180 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
In Eskimo, there are three principal active constructions of independent
clauses, as follows:
1. Intransitive. The verb is essentially an active participle in apposition to the
subject; it gets is verbal force from its predicate position at the end of the
clause. Both subject and verb are absolutive. There is of course no object.
2. Half-transitive, used when the object is indefinite. The term is a misnomer
since the construction is essentially intransitive. The "object" is not a true
direct object but is instead an indirect object which, accordingly, is put in a
non-accusative oblique case, generally the modalis (instrumental-sociative).
3. Transitive, used when the object is definite. The verb is essentially a gerund
that is "possessed" by the subject, which, accordingly, is put in the relative case.
The object is in immediate apposition to the verb, and both object and verb
are absolutive, all in accordance with Trask's Type Β ergativity. This
construction is alien to Nostratic, being clearly an innovation.
Thus, there is no true accusative in Eskimo — nothing like the accusative in
*-m that is historically discernible in certain Tungusic, Uralic, and Indo-European
languages (as Classically known), nor any form that can be plausibly derived from it
such as -nV < *-n < *-m, or (~wV or -bV) < *-mV < *-m, where V is an
unspecified vowel. Nor is there anything similar to the definite-accusative shared by
Turkic and Mongolian, with forms derivable from *-i, or *-ig, evidently
innovations peculiar to these particular divisions of Altaic. But this does not matter
in this discussion since neither the impersonal verb nor the heteroclitic declension
ever made any use of an accusative in the strict sense; the object in the latter was
strictly absolutive, being always indefinite.
Now, when we look at the singular nominative forms in the above Eskimo
declensional paradigm, we see the stems -V, -n, -k, -q, where again V is an
unspecified vowel; the stems cited by Fortescue (1984:206) are similar except that
-n is of course replaced by -t. Fortescue divides these stems into two classes, called
"strong" and "weak", the first containing those stems that are retained throughout the
paradigm or are assimilated to the case stem, the second containing those stems that
are dropped when the case stem is attached. The first class contains -t (< -«), most
-k stems and some -q stems; the second contains all the vowel stems, most -q stems
and a few -k stems. Thus, there has been a minor tendency to confuse the two
classes.
The weak -q stems are the ones that are relevant in this discussion. The
reason for this is that -q is the characteristic ending of the 3rd person singular of
3.5.3.2. Heteroclisis and the Impersonal Verb 181
the intransitive (and half-transitive) verb, which, under these conditions, is endingless
save for the participial marker itself, namely -q. In keeping with its status as a
"weak" consonant in this application, the -q is dropped when additional suffixes are
attached, such as absolutive 1st and 2nd person pronominal endings or dual or plural
markers, all referring to the subject. This is because these suffixes begin with
"strong" consonants, and when the -q precedes them, it is elided, precisely as when
preceding the oblique case stems in the nominal declension. The only exception to
this is when metathesis occurs so that the -q is protected, whereupon it appears as
- r - in the Inuit language described by Fortescue, at least.
It seems strange to refer to q as a weak consonant in these applications in
Eskimo since it is an unvoiced uvular stop; it is alien to English and most other
languages of European origin and is difficult for us to pronounce without special
effort. And indeed, Fortescue does not explain why some -k stems and -q stems
are weak while others are strong; surely, phonology cannot be the sole criterion.
This paradox can be resolved, however, when we realize that these weak stems
appear as unvoiced stops only when they occur in final position; in origin, they are
voiced spirants, respectively velar and uvular, which explains why these sounds are
elided when followed by strong consonants; elision of such sounds has been observed
in many languages under this condition. This also explains why the q appears as
-r- when protected by metathesis, for r in Eskimo is a voiced uvular spirant. This
is confirmed by the fact that the corresponding morpheme in Aleut is likewise a
spirant, spelled by some writers as r and by others as x. The main difference is that
in Aleut the spirant is not transformed into a stop when final (Hamp [ed.] 1976:106).
Nouns with weak -q stems are plentiful in Eskimo, like heteroclitic nouns in
early Indo-European. They arose by nominalization of the intransitive verb in its
3rd person singular (unsuffixed) form, which corresponds exactly to the impersonal
verb of early Indo-European with its -r ending. The same nominalization occurred
in the precursor of Indo-European, which accounts for the prevalence of heteroclitic
nouns in that family and the disappearance of -r- before the oblique-« declensional
forms.
Presumably, this participial -r form in Indo-European once had an uvular
articulation as in Aleut and originally in Eskimo, later falling together with the
other r when final, perhaps in parallel with the loss of laryngeals. Conceivably, the
elision of the uvular spirant in Indo-European could have been secondary, occurring
independently of the same phenomenon in Eskimo, but there is no particular reason
to believe that it was. And if it was not secondary, the correspondence with Eskimo
is complete — syntactically, morphologically, phonologically, historically. In other
words, the phenomenon dates from Nostratic times, leaving clear traces only at
opposite ends of the Circumpolar belt.
182 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
3.5.3.3. The Origin of Gender in Indo-European
My reference here is almost entirely to Thomas Burrow's classic The Sanskrit
Langauge (1959), particularly his Chapter IV "The Formation of Nouns", which I
consider a masterpiece, and specifically Section 21, "Grammatical Gender".
It is apparent that there was no gender in Common Nostratic except possibly a
discrimination between animate and inanimate. All other manifestations of gender
are different in the descendant families and obviously secondary from the Nostratic
point of view. Even in Indo-European languages, where the manifestations of
gender are particularly well developed and persistent into modern times, it is clear
from internal evidence that much of the development was secondary even from the
point of view of Common Indo-European; I am referring particularly to the
development of the feminine.
Actually, there were two separate suffixal developments that eventually came
to designate females, as follows:
1. *-sor, used mainly in Anatolian. However, in IE-Proper its use was reduced
to a vestigial level as in *swesor 'sister, she who is one's own' and in Latin
uxor 'wife, she who is at the house'; this was due to competition from the
other suffix, whose use was restricted to IE-Proper.
2. *-VH, where H was a vowel-lengthening laryngeal and V a guna vowel, often
i in Indo-Iranian but most often a thematic vowel in the rest of IE-Proper.
This was originally an adjectival formation sometimes used as a neuter
collective; its development as a feminine suffix was an innovation restricted to
IE-Proper.
There is no evidence that these developments of the feminine had any
connection with phenomena in the rest of Nostratic. They were products of the
general process of suffixation inherent in Indo-European and the ancestral Nostratic,
and indeed in SOV languages generally; their eventual emergences as feminines in
Indo-European, and even IE-Proper, were particularly late and secondary.
However, with regard to the dichotomy between neuter and non-neuter (here
"common"), it is a different story. Indo-Europeanists have always been frustrated in
their attempts to account for the remarkable peculiarities of Indo-European gender
as historically observed. While the developments of the feminine were late enough
to facilitate plausible explanations based on data from Indo-European languages
alone, the remaining peculiarities have defied explanation. This is because the
dichotomy between neuter and common goes back to the earliest form of Indo-
3.5.3.3. The Origin of Gender in Indo-European 183
European that can be recovered without considering data from other Nostratic
families, and there has been a general failure to examine the matter from an extra-
Indo-European point of view.
It is remarkable that the neuter ~ common dichotomy never involved the
finite verb as it did the quasi-nominal parts of speech (nouns, pronouns, adjectives,
gerunds, participles), especially since the finite verb itself originated as either a
participle or a gerund. This is in contrast to the situation in Afroasiatic, for
example, where the masculine ~ feminine dichotomy is maintained about as
thoroughly in the finite verb as in other grammatical categories.
It is also remarkable that, originally, the declension of nouns in the two
categories differed only in that the common nouns (i.e., nouns of common gender)
took the accusative in *-m, while the neuters did not, being endingless (i.e.,
absolutive) like the nominative; all the other case endings were identical in the two
categories. Admittedly, the common nouns eventually acquired a special nominative
ending in *-s, and the neuters a special class with a casus rectus in *-m, but these
were secondary.
These peculiarities make Indo-European unique; there seems to be nothing like
them elsewhere, and there is no explanation for them as long as we restrict our
information to purely Indo-European sources. But as soon as we look elsewhere in
Nostratic, particularly Uralic, a great light dawns — a cogent solution readily emerges.
As Burrow shows (1959:205), the dichotomy between neuter and common arose
from adjectival formations derived from verbal action nouns by a shift of accent
from the root to the adjectival stem, and by a further nominalization of the resulting
adjective to epithetically represent some egregious object or animal or (more often) a
human being who was somehow conspicuously characterized by the implied verbal
action, thus producing an agent noun. This process of nominalization was a
constantly recurring phenomenon, as we have already seen in our discussion of the
heteroclitic declension; the difference is that, in the latter case, the resulting noun
did not originally represent an egregious object or person. There were, of course,
many other instances of nominalization, but these are the two that are most relevant
in the present discussion. It is evident that the two nominalizations in question did
not develop simultaneously since the latter goes back to Nostratic while the former
apparently does not.
Thus, there was a period in the early history of Indo-European when many
action nouns and agent nouns existed in pairs, one member an action noun and the
other member the corresponding agent noun. The two members of a given pair
were identical in form except for the shift in accent. Their declensions differed only
in the form of the direct object. The objective form of the action noun was
endingless, being absolutive like the nominative. On the other hand, title objective
form of the agent noun was the definite-accusative in *-m, as inherited from
184 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
Nostratic, for the simple reason that the noun represented a conspicuous object or
person and was accordingly definite.
The outcome of this process was first described by myself in a 1967 pamphlet
and later repeated, as follows (J. C. Kerns 1985:29—30, slightly adapted):
This explains the peculiar character of gender in Indo-European. Unlike
the gender systems in other families, the system in Indo-European was not
originally based on any such antithesis as large-small, important-unimportant,
male-female, or even animate-inanimate; instead, it developed very naturally
out of the dichotomy between definite and indefinite inherited from Common
Indo-Ural-Altaic. Since this dichotomy affected only semantically nominal
parts of speech, it is easy to see why gender never intruded into the
Indo-European finite verb, despite its quasi-nominal formal origin. Also, since
the dichotomy formally involved only the presence or absence of the
-m accusative, it is easy to see why the same mark was originally the sole
means of formally differentiating between common and neuter in Indo-
European (the nominative singular in -s was clearly secondary, as shown by
early common r-stems and η-stems without ~s). Further, we can easily see
why the objective form of neuters in Indo-European was identical to the
nominative, for this was typical of indefinite nouns in Common Indo-Ural-
Altaic.
As stated above, the earliest discernible basis of differentiation between
common and neuter in Indo-European was the dichotomy between agent nouns
and action nouns, the discrimination being based on the dichotomy between
definite and indefinite inherited from Common Indo-Ural-Altaic. These nouns
existed in pairs, both members derived from the same root and formally
similar in that they generally had the same suffix also. Yet despite the formal
similarity, the semantic difference was acute. We know this is true, not only
because agent nouns took the -m accusative (being thought of as definite), but
also because they were marked by a shift in accent. In course of time,
however, one member or the other tended to fall out of use, being replaced by
some other word of unrelated origin. Eventually, after this lexical erosion and
regeneration had gone on long enough, most of the action nouns and agent
nouns no longer existed as phonetically similar pairs. Thus the formal basis
for the dichotomy between definite and indefinite no longer existed, for the
most part, so that dichotomy was eventually given up. It is at this point that
gender, as we know it, really began in Indo-European, for the surviving
member of a given pair was now usually isolated and, in effect, permanently
assigned to one of two categories. Subsequent classifications of nouns tended
to be made on a purely formal basis by several different phonetic criteria at
3.5.3.4. Nominal Case Endings 185
different times; this is why the various manifestations of gender in the
historically known Indo-European languages are so illogically organized.
Today, I would extend Indo-Ural-Altaic to mean Northern Nostra tic as here
defined.
I should add that the above process of adjectival nominalizatiori was very
likely the starting point for the declension of adjectives in agreement with associated
nouns, which eventually involved neuters, feminines and masculines as well as the
original common nouns. Adjectival agreement in the rest of Northern Nostratic,
especially on such a grand scale, is unknown except in late imitation of post-Indo-
European languages.
3.5.3.4. Nominal Case Endings
After 10,000 years of unrecorded linguistic changes, it is impossible to justify
much confidence in any specific reconstruction we might make of nominal
declensions or any other class of paradigms in Common Northern Nostratic, not to
mention ancestral forms of Nostratic languages South of the Caucasus. The best we
can do is to make tentative suggestions, with varying degrees of confidence, on
several points of interest.
For indefinite nouns, at least, the nominative was absolutive, lacking a specific
ending peculiar to itself; the objective form of these nouns was absolutive like the
nominative. However, it appears that there was a special category of nouns,
representing conspicuous persons, animals or things, that were characteristically
definite; these were nouns of the homo class, vestigially preserved in Mongolian and
Indo-European, with considerable secondary extension in the latter, and with
eventual abandonment of the definite status in some instances. The nominative of
these nouns was suffixed by a vowel that seems to have been a deictic element,
derived from a vocalic demonstrative, which served to emphasize the customarily
definite status of the noun; through the rest of the paradigm, however, the vowel
tended to be reduced or elided before the oblique case stems since it was a weak
phoneme. Being definite, these nouns naturally took the definite-accusative in *-m,
which itself was a deictic element as vestigially exemplified by the accusative of
specification in Classical Greek. Most nouns, however, were probably condi-
tionally definite, depending on the specific situation; they took the *-m accusative
when definite, the nominative usually remaining absolutive.
I see no evidence for ergativity in Nostratic except as scattered secondary
developments at much later times.
Much of what can be said of the accusative has already been mentioned: The
186 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
mark of the accusative was *-m, used only when the object was definite. Examples
of this marker are known from Indo-European, Uralic, and Tungusic. Being final, it
often gave rise to forms in - η as observed in several Indo-European and Uralic
languages, and probably in Etruscan and Dravidian, where the ancestral *~m has not
been historically preserved.
In contrast, some Tungusic languages exhibit denasalization of the *-m accusa-
tive, yielding -b, -w, and -u in addition to -m\ Sinor (1988:714—715) gives an
example where all four forms occur in a single language, namely Even. Sinor calls
attention to the fact that in many instances these forms are further suffixed by a
vowel. He attributes this to a general tendency in these languages to avoid non-
vocalic finals, and he may well be right; there is a similar tendency in Japanese,
which I have come to regard as Tungusic in origin. However, there is an alternative
suggestion, and that is to regard the vowel, in this instance, as a deictic element
derived from a vocalic demonstrative used to emphasize the definite status of the
accusative. Such a phenomenon is known in at least one Uralic language, namely,
Vogul, and also in Etruscan, here yielding -nV < *-n < *-m.
The Japanese accusative is now -o, apparently to be derived from - w o as
indicated in the syllabaries. It is now obligatory in formal speech and writing, being
required regardless of definiteness, although this was not so in the Nara and Heian
periods (Old Japanese [OJ], contemporary with Old English). Shibatani (1990:99)
cites other scholars, mostly Murayama and Roy Andrew Miller, who have suggested
a derivation from a Manchu-Tungus accusative particle *-bV, whose original
function, according to Murayama, was to "mark emphasis and exclamation rather
than a grammatical object".
Shibatani (1990:340—347) considers the matter at length farther on. He agrees
with Murayama that -wo in OJ was indeed used to mark emphasis and exclamation
(here being similar to the accusative of specification in Classical Greek), but he
goes on to show that, in most instances, it was applied to the direct object. This is
close to my own view, provided we further postulate a historical progression *-bV <
(*-b or *-w) < *-m, or perhaps (*-bV or *-wV) < *-mV < *-m, thus relating it to
similar forms in Tungusic, Uralic, and Indo-European in their early stages. It is odd
that none of these scholars has noticed the possibility of an origin based on
denasalization of m, particularly since this tendency has been endemic in all the
customarily recognized branches of Altaic throughout its observable existence as a
separate family. In this connection, a derivation of the Japanese 1st singular
pronoun from *wV- < (*wV- or *bV~) < *mV- is by no means implausible; such a
historical progression seems obvious once we examine the matter from a Northern
Nostratic and Tungusic point of view.
There seem to have been several ways of expressing the genitive. A zero
(absolutive) ending could be used when the noun was indefinite and in immediate
3.5.3.4. Nominal Case Endings 187
apposition to the head noun. When the association with the head was more remote,
the relative (oblique-η) marker was used as in Uralic, Altaic, and Eskimo, without
further suffixation. When the genitive was definite, a deictic vowel was sometimes
added to emphasize the definite status; the Japanese genitive in -no may be an
example of this. All the Indo-European genitive markers (except the vestigial -n of
Etruscan), including the ubiquitous -s (shared with Etruscan), are obvious innovations.
There seems to have been a locative case in *-i as in Indo-European, but
often preceded by the relative marker as in Eskimo and in Japanese -ni. There was
a tendency to confuse this case, in both form and function, with a dative or lative in
a low vowel such as *-e or *-a, which appears in Indo-European and Altaic (e.g.,
Turkic and perhaps the Japanese allative in -e), and which again was sometimes
attached to the relative marker. A reversal of role is suggested in Collinder's
reconstruction of the Uralic paradigm, where he shows *-na for the locative and
*-nV (V = a front vowel) for the dative-lative.
Another prominent local case was one in *-T or *-TV, where Τ was a dental
consonant such as t or d, with some confusion as to both form and function — there
may have been distinct varieties of this morpheme in Nostratic itself, as perhaps
illustrated in Japanese -de and -to, respectively instrumental and sociative.
In Indo-European, the situation was complex. In Hittite, the marker was used
for the instrumental, with an affricated version serving for the ablative. But in
IE-Proper, it seems originally to have been an ablative restricted to thematic nouns
as in Sanskrit, with later extensions to the other declensions in Italic aid Iranian.
Some adverbs in Greek, and the genitive of o-stems in East Baltic and Slavic, are
customarily attributed to this but with loss or assibilation of the T.
In Uralic, it is essentially an ablative or separative, with secondary application
in the closely related partitive function.
In Altaic, it may originally have been ablative as in Uralic and Indo-
European, but it was also used as a locative in Orkhon Turkish and was later
limited to that function in most Turkic languages, the ablative now being expressed
by further suffixing the marker with -n, the genitive affix. In Mongolian it is
dative-locative.
It seems to have been common, in Nostratic languages, to be rather flexible in
assigning (and changing) the meanings applied to case markers, especially those for
the local cases. We have seen this in the above discussion. Even in a single
language, a given marker could eventually develop a variety of meanings. In Latin,
for example, the so-called "ablative" usually had an instrumental meaning when used
without a preposition; other meanings, mostly locative and ablative, were determined
by the choice of preposition.
188 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
3.5.4. The Nostratic Verb
It is difficult to be specific on this topic. The reservations expressed by
Collinder in regard to the reconstruction of the Uralic verb apply here with even
greater force. Too much information has been lost, especially in regard to the
development of modes, preterits and perfective conjugations; the secondary
developments in the descendant families are so numerous and various that it seems
impossible to recover the primordial features. The best information available seems
to be the few items of comparative data gleaned by Collinder relating Uralic to
Indo-European and listed above in Section 3.5.1. (note here also the article by
Bomhard [1988c] entitled "The Prehistoric Development of the Athematic Verbal
Endings in Proto-Indo-European", where the parallels between the Indo-European
and Uralic conjugational systems are explored). As stated therein, I regard these
items as features of undivided Northern Nostratic itself.
In general, it seems likely that the first two persons in the simplest
conjugations were expressed by 1st and 2nd personal pronominal suffixes referring to
the subject as in Indo-European and Uralic. The 3rd person took only the bare
participial stem in the singular, with suffixed *-k or *-t in the dual or plural,
respectively.
3.6. Conclusions
Obviously, the work of reconstructing the syntax and morphology of undivided
Nostratic is unfinished, to say the least. This is to be expected, of course, in view
of the general lack of historically preserved information which would pertain to the
relevant periods, and also because too few scholars have interested themselves in
Nostratic in a serious and sustained way. As indicated above, the difficulties are
particularly severe in attempting to reconstruct the main features of the Nostratic
verb except in the most general terms. This becomes more understandable,
however, when we consider the fact that Indo-European still presents a number of
intractable problems even after 200 years of investigation by many brilliant and
dedicated scholars.
Nevertheless, I have already expressed a number of conclusions that I believe
to be solid; I see no need to repeat them here except as they may arise in the
discussion that follows. To save time and space, I will omit most of the
argumentation.
It is convenient to regard Nostratic as consisting of two major divisions, a
Northern and a Southern, with the Caucasus as the dividing line between them. The
principal member of the Southern Group is obviously Afroasiatic with its enormous
3.6. Conclusions 189
extension through the Near East and North Africa in both prehistoric and historic
times; minor members would include Sumerian and Kartvelian and (perhaps)
Elamo-Dravidian. However, I am more inclined to regard the last as originally a
member of the Northern Group, with closest relationship to both Uralic and Altaic
jointly; the presence of its speakers in the South can be accounted for by assuming a
prehistoric Southward movement of population from Siberia and Central Asia,
preceding the Indo-Iranians by a few millennia.
The Northern division would then consist of Indo-European, Uralic-Yukaghir,
Altaic, Chukchi-Kamchatkan, Gilyak (Nivkh), and Eskimo-Aleut, plus the precursor
of Elamo-Dravidian in its Siberian home.
Strictly speaking, my conclusions on morphology apply only to the Northern
Group; I have largely ignored the Southern Group because of a dearth of
information. What little I have suggests that the secondary developments are many
and ancient, obscuring the primordial forms. However, the occurrence of - m - in
the 1st person plural of verbs in Hausa gives hope that, if investigators continue to
search diligently in the Southern fringe areas of Afroasiatic, the early features of
Southern Nostratic morphology will eventually become somewhat clearer.
Nevertheless, important differences with the Northern Group will suiely persist;
already it is clear that such Afroasiatic peculiarities as the feminine in -t- and the
2nd person pronouns in -k- are alien to the Northern Group.
The expansion of Nostratic speech seems to have been occasioned by the
development and spread of Mesolithic cultures due to the advent of Neothermal
conditions upon the waning of the most recent Ice Age. Across Northern Eurasia, at
least, the expansion seems to have been largely focal in character, occurring so
swiftly that essentially a single language was distributed mostly Eastward along
much of Northern Eurasia shortly after the ice began to recede. Otherwise, there
would be no way to account for the common fund of highly characteristic
pronominal forms, syntactic structures and distinctive grammatical features that still
persist in Northern Nostratic languages, however spottily preserved at this late date.
As new immigrants were attracted Northward they must have adopted the local
versions of the language that had already been established, mixing with the earlier
inhabitants and obscuring earlier racial orientations. An exception to this linguistic
absorption was a late Northern extension of Dene-Caucasian in the form of Ket.
Soon, however, the economic possibilities of the Circumpolar regions for
hunter-gatherers reached a point of diminishing returns for the increasing population.
Because of this, and because these lands were not suitable for the agricultural
techniques that were then emerging in the Fertile Crescent, the Northern region
became an exporter of population. Emergent tribes encroached upon each other and
expanded into surrounding areas, either adopting the local dialects or imposing their
own. In either case, there must have been a great deal of linguistic borrowing
190 3. Nostratic Morphology and Syntax
between adjacent dialects, eroding old forms and helping to spread new ones over
parts of the region. An example of this was the sharing of a new definite-accusative
in -i or -ig peculiar to Mongolian and Turkic, branches of Altaic which are not
fundamentally closely related. Here, we have an example, on a grand scale, of the
classic sequence consisting of an extensive focal expansion, soon followed by several
millennia of the process described in Schmidt's Wave Theory.
As generally occurs in such cases, the erosion of primordial morphological
features was most extensive and rapid in those areas where the social interaction was
most intense, namely the Central and Southern parts of the Northern Nostratic
region. Accordingly, it is not surprising that Uralic in the Central part, and
Dravidian and Turkic in the Southern part, have preserved relatively little except in
a distorted and fragmented form; it is good to see, however, that there are some
exceptions to this rule.
By the same token, it is in the outlying areas that we find the greatest
conservatism: Indo-European and Eskimo-Aleut in the extreme West and East, and
the Circumpolar fringe in the extreme North, extending from Finland in the West to
Greenland in the East. The latter includes Northern Uralic-Yukaghir, Tungusic,
Chukchi-Kamchatkan, and again Eskimo-Aleut. To a lesser degree, it also includes
Mongolian, since this represents a recent Southern emergence from a more Northerly
location. Obviously, these groups all exhibit egregious innovations of their own, but
these are easy to identify because they tend to be relatively isolated since these
languages have been less intensively subjected to the processes described in Schmidt's
Wave Theory.
Accordingly, I suggest that future investigations into Northern Nostratic be
directed principally to the outlying areas. Good descriptive grammars are urgently
needed.
Indo-Europeanists will note that this entire discussion has been incompatible
with the idea that the Indo-European language was first introduced into non-Russian
Europe by horse-riding pastoralists led by aggressive chiefs from Southern Russia or
Central Asia at such a relatively recent date as 4500 BCE. Though this has been the
prevailing assumption for many years, I firmly reject it.
4. COMPARATIVE VOCABULARY OF THE NOSTRATIC LANGUAGES
4.1. Introductory Remarks
In comparing the lexical material from the various Nostratic daughter
languages, I have tried to be very careful about the issue of semantic plausibility.
Where there is either a one-to-one or an extremely close semantic correspondence,
there is, of course, no problem. Unfortunately, things are not always this clear-cut.
Quite often, there is not a one-to-one semantic correspondence — in such cases, we
must be able to derive the proposed cognates from the postulated ancestor form by
widely-attested semantic shifts and not by mere speculation. Therefore, in
attempting to determine whether or not particular lexical items from the various
language families might be related, I have made extensive use of Carl Darling
Buck's A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European
Languages as a control for the semantic development of the proposed lexical
parallels, and references to the appropriate sections of this work are given at the end
of each proposed Nostratic etymology. It may be noted that, in examining the
lexicons of Kartvelian, Afroasiatic, Uralic-Yukaghir, Elamo-Dravidian, Altaic, and
Sumerian, I have observed that semantic shifts similar to those described by Buck
for the Indo-European languages are found over and over again in these other
language families as well. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that, in order to gain
a complete understanding of how I have arrived at my proposals, Buck s dictionary
must be consulted. However, in a number of instances, where I felt it was
warranted due to the wide semantic differences found among the forms cited from
the daughter languages, I have given brief explanations within the etymologies
themselves.
As valuable as Buck's dictionary is, however, it is not without its shortcomings.
In the first place, as noted by Buck himself (1949:xii), the dictionary is not complete
— due to the nature of the material involved, Buck and his assistants had to be
selective in choosing what to include. Next, the research upon which the dictionary
is based is now over half a century old. Therefore, Buck's dictionary must be
supplemented by more recent scholarship. Unfortunately, though, this work is
spread throughout so many journal articles, dissertations, and books that it is
virtually impossible to consult all of it, especially when one is dealing with multiple
language families.
192 4. Comparative Vocabulary of the Nostratic Languages
It is not enough, moreover, simply to compare dictionary forms. Rather, when
working with the lexical data from the various Nostratic daughter languages, one
must strive to ascertain the underlying semantics, that is to say, the fundamental
meaning or meanings from which the full set of semantic nuances are derived, based
upon actual usage, wherever this is possible, and one must be cognizant of the
interrelationship between social, cultural, and conceptual factors on the one hand and
semantic structures on the other (cf. Birnbaum 1977:41—51). It goes without saying
that this is neither a simple nor an easy undertaking.
The approach that I have followed thus leads to the establishment of what may
be called "families of words" in the tradition of the great Indo-European
comparative dictionaries such as Pokorny (1959) and Walde (1927—1932). The
starting point is always the reconstructed Nostratic forms. The material cited from
the individual Nostratic daughter languages is then to be judged primarily by
whether or not it can convincingly be derived from the antecedent Nostratic forms
either directly or through widely-attested semantic shifts.
Another important point that needs to be reiterated concerns how I segment
the reconstructed forms I am dealing with. Comparison of the various Nostratic
daughter languages, especially Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian, and Proto-
Afroasiatic, indicates that the rules governing the structural patterning of roots and
stems in Proto-Nostratic were most likely as follows:
A. There were no initial vowels in Proto-Nostratic. Therefore, every root
began with a consonant.
B. Originally, there were no initial consonant clusters either. Consequently,
every root began with one and only one consonant. Medial clusters were
permitted, however.
C. Two basic syllable types existed: (A) *CV and (B) *CVC, where C = any
non-syllabic and V = any vowel. Permissible root forms coincided
exactly with these two syllable types.
D. An inflectional stem could either be identical with a root or it could
consist of a root plus a single derivational morpheme added as a suffix
to the root: *CVC-VC~. Any consonant could serve as a suffix.
E. A stem could thus assume any one of the following shapes: (A) *CV~,
(B) *CVC-, (C) *CVC-VC- (*CVC-C- as well, before vowels), or (D)
*CVC-CVC~. As in Proto-Altaic, the undifferentiated stems were real
forms in themselves and could be used without additional suffixes.
4.1. Introductory Remarks 193
The original root structure patterning was preserved longer in Proto-
Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian, and Proto-Afroasiatic than in the other branches.
The root structure constraints found in Proto-Indo-European were an innovation.
Both the Proto-Dravidian and the Proto-Altaic root structure patterning can easily
be derived from the above system. I assume that the Proto-Uralic rule that all
words have to end in a vowel was an innovation. It should be mentioned that
reduplication was a widespread phenomenon. On the basis of the evidence of
Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Kartvelian, Proto-Afroasiatic, Proto-Dravidian, and
Proto-Altaic, it may be assumed that there were three fundamental stem types: (A)
verbal stems, (B) nominal and adjectival stems, and (C) pronominal and indeclinable
stems. Uralic stands apart in showing no differentiation between verbal and nominal
stems. In Sumerian, though nominal and verbal roots were identical in form, three
separate word classes were distinguished: (A) nouns, (B) verbs, and (C) adjectives.
In Proto-Nostratic, only pronominal and indeclinable stems could end in a vowel.
Verbal and nominal stems, on the other hand, had to end in a consomint (though
vowels could serve as grammatical markers).
For Indo-European, the standard etymological dictionaries have beer, consulted:
Buck 1949; Delamarre 1984; Mann 1984-1987; Pokorny 1959-1969; Walde
1927—1932; Watkins 1985. The Proto-Indo-European reconstructions are made in
accordance with the radical reinterpretation of the Proto-Indo-European
phonological system proposed by Gamkreldize—Ivanov (especially 1984), on the one
hand, and Hopper (1973), on the other. For Kartvelian, the main sources are:
Gamkrelidze—Macavariani 1982; Klimov 1964; K. H. Schmidt 1962. Most of the
Afroasiatic etymologies are based upon my own research. The first attempt at a
comparative Afroasiatic dictionary, namely, M. Cohen (1947), is now totally out of
date and can only be used with utmost caution. It will soon be replaced by
Diakonoffs Comparative Historical Vocabulary of Afrasian. Also of value are
the following: Cerny 1976; D. Cohen 1970- ; Ehret 1980 and 1989a; Heine 1978;
Hudson 1989; Jungraithmayr-Shimizu 1978; Leslau 1979 and 1987; Murtonen 1989;
Newman 1977; Sasse 1979 and 1982; Tomback 1978; Vycichl 1983. There are two
etymological dictionaries for Uralic: Collinder 1955 and Rédei 1986—1988. The
Proto-Uralic reconstructions closely follow Décsy 1990, while the Firino-Ugrian
reconstructions mostly agree with Rédei 1986—1988. Due to the wide discrepancies
found in the literature in transcribing the various Uralic daughter languges, the
transcription of the forms cited from the individual Uralic daughter languages in this
book has mostly been standardized to conform with that used by Collinder. This is
a somewhat less than ideal solution, however: in the first place, Collinder's
transcriptions are not always the most accurate; in the second place, Collinder's
system of transcription is now considered somewhat antiquated. Nonetheless, it
194 4. Comparative Vocabulary of the Nostratic Languages
would have only been confusing not to standardize the transcriptions, and Collinder's
has the advantage of applying a consistent system to all branches of Uralic. For
Dravidian, the standard etymological dictionary is Burrow-Emeneau 1984. The
Altaic reconstructions are based upon Street 1963, while the examples are mostly
taken from Poppe 1955 and 1960; Tsintsius 1975-1977 is the standard (Manchu-)
Tungus etymological dictionary. As in the case of the Uralic languages, a certain
amount of standardization has had to be done in the transcription of the forms from
the various Altaic daughter languages. In general, the system of transcription is
close to that used in Poppe 1960. Sumerian forms are cited from Hübner—
Reizammer 1985—1986. Etymological (where they exist) and non-etymological
dictionaries for individual languages have also been heavily consulted, as have
journal articles and papers beyond count — a complete list can be found in the
references. The reconstructed forms for each proto-language conform to a uniform
method of transcription — deviations from traditional transcriptions are explained in
the chapter on phonology. In the case of Proto-Uralic and Proto-Finno-Ugrian, I
have kept the symbol 3, which is traditionally used in Uralic studies as a cover
symbol to indicate a vowel of unknown quality.
It must also be noted that I have been selective in the forms cited from the
various Nostratic daughter languages. My goal has been to give a representative
sampling, in part to illustrate the semantics involved, and not to cite all known
cognates — nevertheless, the documentation is quite extensive. For additional
information, the references cited at the end of each etymology should be consulted,
as should other works listed at the end of this book but not necessarily cited after
individual etymologies.
Even though I have made extensive use of the works of other scholars doing
research on the comparative vocabulary of the Nostratic languages, I have sometimes
purposely excluded material that they have cited. This does not necessarily mean
that I reject their suggestions (though in many cases it does). Rather, I have
endeavored to verify all of the data cited by other scholars on the basis of the
works available to me. In those cases where I have been unable to verify the data
cited, I have not included their proposals. Moreover, in those instances where I
have intentionally rejected, either fully or in part, the proposals made by others, I
have not given references to their work nor have I discussed the reasons for
rejection (almost always because the semantics are not plausible and/or because there
are problems with the phonology).
One final point: all language names have been fully spelled out rather than
abbreviated. Moreover, since different spellings are sometimes found in the
literature, the language names have been mostly standardized to agree with what is
found in Ruhlen 1987. In those cases where a particular language is referred to by
two different names, both are given, separated by a slash.

Proto-Indo-European *guer- (see also Mayrhofer 1956—1980.1:450, who
notes that the outside connections of jvàrati, etc. are uncertain).
Problematic, from a phonological standpoint, is the comparison with Old
Irish guai 'coal', which is usually taken to be from *goulo~ or *geulo~,
and Welsh glo 'coal', which, according to Morris Jones (1913:108), stands
for *gwloe < Brit. *guläuis < *guel(äx)~. However, these may be
brought in as well if the Old Irish form is derived from a reduplicated
*go-gl-o- (< *k'o-k'l-o-) or the like, with the Welsh form representing
unreduplicated *gl-o- (< *k'l-o-).

A. Proto-Indo-European *hhet'~ l*Hhat'~] 'to cut into, to etch': Armenian

make a hole (in), to pierce, to prick, to stab, to slash, to perforate, to

1977- :226—227; Puhvel 1984- .3:248-255, 255-256, 256-257,
263—265, and 269—274. Though the comparison of Armenian
hatanem with the Anatolian forms is semantically flawless, there are
problems with the phonology (cf. Puhvel 1984— .3:254), since double
writing of the dental stop in Hittite points to original *-tlh
l~, while the
Armenian form points to original *-t'~. However, double writing of
medial stops in Hittite can also indicate the presence of a lost laryngeal
as in the case of (nom. sg.) me-ik-ki-is 'large', which is to be derived
from earlier *mek'~ plus the suffix *-Hi- > *mek'Hi- > the attested
Hittite mekkis. Thus, the comparison of Armenian hatanem with the
Anatolian forms having medial double writing can be maintained if we
derive the Anatolian forms from earlier *hhet'H~ [hhat'H-i, which
would yield Hittite hatta- as the regular outcome (for details, cf.
Bomhard 1992c:5—11 and to appear/a). Support for this interpretation
may be found in Hittite hatrai-, which has consistent single writing.
Thus, it is possible to envision a pre-Proto-Anatolian root *hhet'~
[*Hhat'~], which was then extended by two separate suffixes in Proto-
Anatolian proper: (A) *hhet'-Ha- [*hhat'-Ha~], yielding Hittite
hatta- upon loss of the laryngeal and (B) *Hhet'-ra- [*hhat'-ra~],
yielding Hittite *hatra~. Stem (A) was further extended by a suffix
-ra-, giving the attested agent noun hattara- 'prick, awl', which, in
turn, served as the basis for the denominative verb hattarai-. Other
derivatives of stem (A) are hattalla- 'club, mace' and hattalkesna-

the denominative verb hatrai- is derived, is unattested.
